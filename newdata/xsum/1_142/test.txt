Bradley Lowery, from Blackhall Colliery near Hartlepool, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013. More than £700,000 was raised to pay for treatment in the USA, including a donation of £200,000 from Everton. However, last week his mother Gemma revealed his cancer had grown and treatment would only give him more time. On Tuesday it was revealed that Bradley had been sent more than 11,000 Christmas cards from well-wishers. A campaign to encourage people to send him the cards had been organised by an Everton fan.	A five-year-old boy with terminal cancer has appeared as a mascot at the Sunderland v Chelsea game.
The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin. She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked. O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York. In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker". The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services. However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911." She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.	US comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has revealed that she suffered a heart attack last week.
Tennant was the 10th Doctor and Piper played his on-screen companion Rose Tyler in the BBC One show. Filming on the show, which will also star John Hurt, will start next week. Tennant's successor, Matt Smith - also in the special with his new assistant played by Jenna-Louise Coleman - says fans "will not be disappointed" by the 3D show, due to air on 23 November. Tennant and Piper have long been rumoured to be making a return for the special, which is being written by the show's executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat. In January, Piper, appearing on the Graham Norton show, denied she would be appearing. "I wasn't asked, no," she said. "I think Matt Smith may have said, in passing or in jest, it would be nice. "I think maybe he said that and then it became something quite different, but no." Smith has said the show "manages to pay homage to everything - and look forward". "I read it and I clapped at the end. I think it's hilarious, it's epic and it's vast," he said. Moffat, meanwhile, has said he took special care to protect the secrets of the story. "One length I've gone to which is a really good security measure - I make sure I don't get a script, because I will lose it," he said. "I forbid people to hand me one. It's on my computer under lock and key." The first story of Doctor Who's 2013 run, The Bells of Saint John - described by Moffat as a "proper London thriller" - was screened on Saturday. Viewers saw the Doctor and new companion, Clara, played by Coleman, battling an evil entity in the world's wi-fi networks. Future episodes of the show, which is filmed in Cardiff, see the return of the Cybermen and old enemy the Ice Warriors, who last appeared during the Jon Pertwee era in 1974. Tennant starred in Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010 while Piper first appeared in 2005 opposite Christopher Eccleston, who played the ninth Doctor. She left the show in 2006 but returned for a number of episodes in 2008 as well as for Tennant's final episode, broadcast on 1 January 2010. The first episode of Doctor Who, An Unearthly Child, starring William Hartnell as the Timelord, was broadcast on 23 November 1963. As part of the anniversary events, the BBC will also broadcast An Adventure in Space and Time - a one-off drama looking at how the sci-fi show came to be made. Doctor Who: The Bells of Saint John will be shown on BBC One at 18:15 GMT on Saturday.	David Tennant and Billie Piper will appear in the 50th anniversary special of Doctor Who, the BBC has confirmed.
The scenery ranges from white sandy beaches with an abundance of marine life to dense jungle. Palau favours sustainable tourism, which along with foreign aid is the mainstay of its economy. Palau became independent in 1994, after being part of a United Nations trust territory administered by the US for 47 years. It relies on financial aid from the US, provided under a Compact of Free Association which gives the US responsibility for Palau's defence and the right to maintain military bases there. Direct aid was set to wind up in 2009, but the US agreed to an additional package of $250 million in January 2010. Tourism is low key, although growing in economic importance. Many visitors come from Taiwan, with which Palau has diplomatic ties. Taiwanese aid boosts the economy. The government is Palau's largest employer. Monoliths and other relics are reminders of an ancient culture that thrived on the islands, and despite Western trappings many Palauans identify strongly with their traditions and rites. Palau's recent history has been dominated by outside influences from Spain, Britain, Germany, Japan and the US. Palau saw some of the region's fiercest fighting in World War II. There is concern that the low-lying islands could be badly affected by rising sea levels possibly due to climate change. Population 20,600 Area 508 sq km (196 sq miles) Major languages Palauan, English Major religions Christianity, Modekngei (indigenous belief) Life expectancy 66 years (men), 72 years (women) Currency US dollar President: Tommy Remengesau Tommy Remengesau was sworn in for a fourth non-consecutive term as president in January 2017, after beating his brother-in-law Surangel Whipps Jr in a closely fought election. He described the 2016 election race as one of the toughest ever on both a political and personal level. He has said that his vision for Palau is to achieve a sustainable future for the country by balancing growth, development and the protection of the Palau's environmental and cultural assets. The law provides for a free press, and there are no reports of official curbs on internet access. The senate has twice tried to ban foreign ownership of media. In 2012, a clause to this effect was included in a new telecommunications bill. It was put on hold amid international criticism. Some key events in Palau's history: circa 2500 BC - Palau's first inhabitants - thought to have come from present-day eastern Indonesia - settle in the islands. The early Palauans develop complex social systems, practice fishing and farming. 1783 - English captain Henry Wilson is shipwrecked on a reef and becomes the first Westerner to visit. 1885 - Spain asserts its claim to the islands. 1899 - Spain sells Palau to Germany, which begins to exploit the islands' resources using native labour. Phosphate is mined and coconut plantations are developed. 1914 - After Germany's defeat in World War I, Japan seizes Palau. 1947 - Palau becomes a United Nations Trust Territory under US administration. 1981 - Republic of Palau comes into being, following the territory's adoption of a constitution in July 1980. President Haruo Remeliik takes office. 1994 - Palau becomes independent under the Compact of Free Association with the US. Palau receives financial and other aid from Washington, and the US retains responsibility for defence and the right to operate military bases. Palau joins the UN.	More than 200 volcanic and coral islands, many of them surrounded by a single barrier reef, make up the northern Pacific nation of Palau.
A statement says to meet the criteria for the revamped 2014 Super League they had to establish a partnership with a men's club or similar institution. It is the chairman's belief that by incorporating the ladies' team with the men's team, we can develop a one-club mentality The club say the shared chairmanship of Ray Trew will bring "mutual gain". "The players will have access to the kind of facilities and resources the Notts squad have," the statement read. "This was another key driving factor. Together with the benefits for the playing staff, there are numerous off-field advantages also, with the ladies' side able to tap into the well-established commercial, media and marketing facilities available at Notts County." Many Lincoln Ladies supporters were angered by the move, which will see the club playing their home games around 35 miles away from their current temporary home at Lincoln City's Sincil Bank. The Lady Imps, who had an application to relocate blocked by the FA Women's Super League in 2012, say they understand fans' concerns and "are working closely with organisations in both Nottingham and Lincoln to ensure that following the club in our new home will be as easy and affordable as possible". The statement added: "It is the chairman's belief that by incorporating the ladies' team with the men's team, we can develop a one-club mentality that will benefit both sides and aid growth of the combined brand." Lady Imps player Megan Harris told BBC Lincolnshire: "It's a really tough situation. I have been with Lincoln since the very beginning so it is hard to see something that I have been part of move. "But obviously I work for the club as well and can see behind the scenes and what's going on and how the women's game is progressing. It is turning into much more of a business now and money is starting to talk. "Liverpool are sitting top of the Super League because they had a massive cash injection and the men's team are backing them. If you want to compete at the highest level then that's what you have to do."	Lincoln Ladies have insisted their controversial relocation to Nottingham and decision to play as Notts County next season was their only option.
Core earnings fell 41% to $1.59bn (Â£1.03bn), with pre-tax profits down to $708m from $1.9bn a year earlier. Like many other energy companies, BG's results have been affected by the fall in oil prices from a year ago. BG said it was still happy with Shell's Â£47bn offer for the firm, despite a recent recovery in oil prices. "There is no change to our view on the offer," said BG chief executive Helge Lund. BG agreed to be bought by Royal Dutch Shell last month. Mr Lund said the deal was expected to be completed by early-2016. BG more than doubled production from its Brazil and Australia operations in the first quarter. However, the impact of the lower oil price from a year earlier was seen in a 21% fall in revenues to $3.99bn.	UK oil and gas exploration firm BG Group, which is set to be taken over by Royal Dutch Shell, has reported a big drop in first-quarter earnings.
Wurz, 41, retired as a racing driver this week and has been asked by owner Stephen Fitzpatrick to run the team. The Austrian said: "I was approached. I would have preferred it not be out in public but I can't deny it." Wurz would not say whether he would accept the role, which would be senior to the new one created for Ryan. Manor team boss John Booth and sporting director Graeme Lowdon have resigned and their last race with the team will be the season finale in Abu Dhabi later this month. Neither has said why they have chosen to quit but it seems they have lost confidence in the management of Fitzpatrick. Ryan spent 34 years at McLaren before being forced to resign following the 'lie-gate' scandal in 2009, when he and Lewis Hamilton were found to have misled race stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. It is widely believed in F1 that Ryan was not responsible for the incident, but was forced to take public responsibility. He received a substantial redundancy payment from McLaren and has recently been running a team of McLaren cars in sportscar racing. Ryan, 61, said: "I'm very excited to be joining the Manor Marussia F1 Team at a pivotal time in their development. Media playback is not supported on this device "Having spent time with Stephen, and understood his vision for the future, it is clear he has ensured there is a strong platform from which the team can make big steps forward in the seasons ahead. "Manor has all the hallmarks of a fiercely competitive racing team, but having grown up in a much more contemporary Formula 1 era, it is a very lean operation with a collaborative culture, which leaves it well placed to contend with the sport's future direction. "There is clearly a big challenge ahead and a lot of work to do, but I can't wait to meet the wider team and get down to business." Full qualifying results Brazilian GP coverage details	Manor want former grand prix driver Alexander Wurz to be their team principal and have named ex-McLaren man Dave Ryan as racing director.
Raymond Russell, 34, was charged with being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug to another person and also drug possession. He appeared in private at Jedburgh Sheriff Court where he made no plea or declaration and his case was continued. Russell was released on bail pending his next court appearance. He was one of two men arrested and charged following Operation Archerfish on Thursday. Eight houses in Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso and Selkirk were searched during the investigation of people suspected of being involved in the sale of drugs. A total of Â£1,200 was seized, as well as drugs with a street value in the region of Â£3,750. Police Scotland say they are also looking for another man in connection with a cannabis cultivation.	A Galashiels man has appeared in court following a major drugs operation involving 100 police officers in the Borders.
Violence erupted on the outskirts of Jerusalem's Old City and across the occupied West Bank after the end of Muslim Friday prayers. Two Palestinians were reported killed by troops - one an alleged assailant in the West Bank, the other in Gaza. Tension remains despite the end of a stand-off at the holy site. Palestinians returned to the hilltop site known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount on Thursday after Islamic authorities lifted a two-week boycott called in protest at new Israeli security measures there. Israel removed all the security apparatus following intense pressure to defuse the crisis after days of deadly clashes. The measures, including metal detectors, security cameras and other infrastructure, were put in place after two Israeli policemen were shot dead by three Israeli Arabs who Israel said had smuggled their weapons into the site. Despite the moves, clashes broke out in and around the compound on Thursday night, leaving 136 Palestinians wounded, Palestinian medics said. There had been fears of further violence as worshippers gathered in East Jerusalem on Friday morning. Israeli police barred Palestinian men under the age of 50 from entering the Old City, site of the holy compound, limiting thousands of Palestinians to pray in the streets outside. The restriction is sometimes used during periods of tension to try to prevent violent protests inside the compound. While most of the crowds dispersed peacefully, brief clashes erupted in the Wadi Joz district, close to the Old City. By evening all restrictions were lifted and Palestinians of all ages were allowed into the mosque compound, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Violence also broke out in the West Bank cities of Qalqilya, Nablus, Hebron, Tulkarm, Ramallah and the outskirts of Bethlehem. Troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets as hundreds of protesters threw rocks, local media said. Scores of Palestinians were injured, according to Palestinian medical sources. The Israeli military said troops shot dead a Palestinian armed with a knife as he ran towards soldiers at the Gush Etzion junction, a roundabout outside a Jewish settlement bloc, about six miles (10km) south of Bethlehem. However, the Palestinian Maan news agency quoted an unnamed eyewitness as saying the man was unarmed when he was shot from 20 metres (65ft) away. In Gaza, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops amid clashes near the border with Israel, the health ministry run by the enclave's Hamas rulers said. Since the crisis escalated following the killing of the two policemen on 14 July, at least five Palestinians have been killed in clashes and three Israeli civilians stabbed to death by a Palestinian. Differences over the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif go to the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the complex is a flashpoint for violence. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and the holiest place in Judaism. It is also the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, according to Islamic tradition. Palestinians said Israel's new security measures upset the delicate status quo, which Israel has repeatedly pledged to maintain since occupying the area in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel said Palestinians were using the issue as a pretext to spread hostility against the Jewish state.	Israeli forces and Palestinians have clashed in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza after weeks of friction over a Jerusalem holy site.
It hit crowds watching the Krewe of Endymion parade in the Mid-City district early on Saturday evening. One person was in custody on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, police said, and terrorism was not suspected. The driver of the pick-up truck seemed unaware of what he had done, one eyewitness told local media. "He was just kind of out of it,'' Kourtney McKinnis told the New Orleans Advocate. Police Chief Michael Harrison said 21 people were taken to hospital, five in serious condition, with another seven also injured. A police officer was among the injured, he said. Social clubs, known as Krewes, organise different parades in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.	A vehicle has driven into a crowd at a Mardi Gras parade in the US city of New Orleans, leaving 28 people injured, some seriously.
Workie, as the animal is called, will star in a TV advertising campaign that starts on Wednesday evening. Since 2012, 5.4 million workers have been signed up to a workplace pension, under the auto-enrolment programme. But millions more people who work for small businesses, or individuals, have yet to be offered a pension plan. All employers are being warned that they need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than Â£10,000 a year. That includes, for example, nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff. The pensions minister, Baroness Altmann, was said to be "personally involved" in designing Workie. A spokesperson for The Pensions Regulator said Workie was the embodiment of something you cannot ignore.	A ten foot tall hairy monster - reminiscent of Sweetums in The Muppets - is to be used to persuade more employers to set up a pension scheme.
The six male athletes also said they engaged in disruptive behaviour. The admission follows a report that assessed Australia's poor swimming performance at the London 2012 Games which pointed to a "toxic" team culture. Swimming Australia said the swimmers will face an inquiry panel. Stilnox, used to treat insomnia, is not considered a performance enhancer and is not a banned substance, but the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) put it on the prohibited list ahead of the Games. In their statement, the six members of the men's 4x100 freestyle relay team said the prescriptions "were filled in Australia before their departure to their staging camp in Spain and prior to the AOC's announcement the drug was (prohibited)". But they "acknowledge that at the time Stilnox was consumed it had been recently prohibited for use". "We stand here collectively to confirm that we did take part in a bonding exercise during which members of the relay team took Stilnox," the six swimmers said. "We acknowledge by our recent action in continuing a recent tradition in the Australia swim team, we have let ourselves down and the people who have supported us." All but one team member took the medication, they said. Then they engaged in pranks they described as "childish" and "stupid", such as knocking on the doors of other athletes and making phone calls. They said they were asleep by 22:30. "I think one of the reasons I agreed to go along with it was all the pressure I was under," one of the swimmers, James Magnussen, said. "Completely inappropriate in hindsight." The relay team, nicknamed Weapons of Mass Destruction before the Olympics, came in fourth in the event, in which they had been expected to deliver a medal. Magnussen, a favourite to win the men's 100 metres freestyle, won a silver. Their admission follows the release of a review of the sport after the country's worst Olympic swimming performance in two decades. It found that amid a lack of leadership a "toxic" team culture developed that led to bullying and misuse of prescription drugs, and that standards and discipline were "too loose". Australia's swimmers won just one gold medal at London 2012, far short of previous medal hauls at other recent Olympics.	Members of Australia's Olympic swimming team said they used the sleeping medication Stilnox during a "bonding" session before the Games last year.
The announcement reignited a long-running debate about Hermione's race with many pointing out that the character's skin colour is never specified by author JK Rowling. In the books, she is described more often by her personality traits than her physical appearance. She's clever and loyal and a valued friend. Many people associate Hermione with Emma Watson who played her in the films. But some argue that it makes sense for Hermione to be black because of the challenges she goes through. The character fights a constant battle against prejudice because she was born to non-wizarding parents.  This casts her as an outsider in a world where wizards of "pure" blood are seen by some to be superior, and "mudbloods" like Hermione are looked down upon. Online, Art by Harry Potter fans depicting Hermione as black or non-white has been circulating on sites like Tumblr for a while. Representations of other well known characters in film and literature as a race they are not typically associated with are also popular. It's known as "racebending". Marianne Khalil is one artist who decided to draw Hermione as black. She says she originally did it as a gift for a friend but "because Hermione is never explicitly stated to be white in the text, there's an opportunity to create representation where there wasn't previously." "It's important that Hermione can be read as a woman of colour, and all of these artworks depicting her as such are reclaiming that for the people who lost representation to the films." Writer Chantell Monique describes herself as a dedicated enthusiast of Harry Potter. She says it wasn't a surprise to see Hermione cast as a black actress. "I was just like 'of course she'd be black'." But she says challenging the norm is important. "Seeing the actress for me is like coming home. There's a comfort to it that I didn't even realise." "I've always connected to Hermione but having her look like me, or my mother, or my aunt is amazing." Cousins Robyn Jordan and Bayana Davis run a website called Black Girls Nerd Out. It centres on identity in fan culture and explores how identity is portrayed. They say this announcement is definitely something to be celebrated. They've both been Harry Potter fans since they were children. While they both could, and did, identify with Hermione, they always saw her as white. Bayana says it's great now to literally be able to see herself in the character. "So much media out there that reinforces the idea that white people can be anything and do anything and we don't get that as much for black characters and black people." Robyn added "Moving away from the fact that a character default is white is important. Representation in general is a big deal." Ebony Elizabeth Thomas is an assistant professor specializing in children's literature at the University of Pennsylvania. In the past, she has written some of her own Potter fan fiction. She says she cried when she saw the casting. For her, this is revolutionary. "What this signals is that race doesn't necessarily have to be the defining characteristic of a human being. What is essential about Hermione is not her skin tone, what's essential about her is that she's smart." Thomas says she's noticing a definite shift towards what she calls colour blind casting. The Broadway musical Hamilton, based on the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, is a great example, says Thomas. Actor Lin-Manuel Miranda currently plays the lead role. He is of Puerto Rican descent. Thomas says depicting one of America's founding fathers as anything other than white would have been difficult until recently. "In a world where Alexander Hamilton can be Puerto Rican then why can't Hermione be black?"	Black actress Noma Dumezweni has been cast as Hermione Granger in the upcoming production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a move celebrated by fans who have long explored the concept of a black Hermione.
The move, if enacted, would make them the first UK banks to introduce negative interest rates, in effect, charging to deposit money. "Global interest rates remain at very low levels... this could result in us charging interest on credit balances," it wrote in a letter to customers. Personal customers are not affected. However, charities and community groups are counted as business clients and so would be affected by the changes, the banks said. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns NatWest, told the BBC the letter was sent to just under 1.3 million of the combined business and commercial customers of the two banks. "We will consider any necessary action in the event of the Bank of England base rate falling below zero, but will do our utmost to protect our customers from any impacts," they said. Jack: The weird world of negative interest rates The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 170,000 members, called on other banks to update customers of any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) "during this uncertain economic period". Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said the warning from Natwest and RBS "will be deeply concerning to small firms". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were "giving themselves wiggle room in the very unlikely event" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative. "The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact they put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences," he told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut them to a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept them on hold earlier this month, despite speculation it would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely "some monetary policy easing" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, he has said he does not favour rates falling any lower than 0.25%. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing it to use their money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding their money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.	NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have warned businesses they may have to charge them to accept deposits due to low interest rates.
Grainger, 40, was involved in many different sports before taking up rowing. And she credits the enduring influence of her karate instructor and school art teacher, Mr Davis, for her success. "Everything he taught me about sport and about myself, stays with me to this day," she told BBC Radio Scotland. "I went from white belt to black belt and I was the first student he had who went from the white belt to black belt in the school. "The day after I got my black belt I went to see him and I had a thank you card and a bottle of wine from my parents just to say thank you for getting me there. "He presented me with the first ever black belt he had ever won, and gave it to me as my black belt. It was just incredible. "It's the one thing, you know if your house was on fire, that I would go to get. "Obviously the family photos and memories, but I would go to get my black belt. Find out how to get into martial arts in our special guide. "It was such a kind gift to give, and obviously meant so much to him and it meant far more to me because of that." Grainger says the "discipline" of karate appealed to her. "I was at Bearsden Academy [near Glasgow] and I loved sport at that age but I wasn't really a member of any club and I didn't do anything special," she explained. "I remember my mum and dad saying 'you need to do more'. I went along to see what it was like and to keep them happy. "I fell in love with the sport, the discipline, the competitive side and the training and I did it for the six years I was at Bearsden Academy. "He [Mr Davis] was a very high level black belt at the time - I got involved and absolutely loved it. "He was a complete inspiration, he really believed in me. "He showed me how much fun sport can be and the confidence you get from it, the enjoyment and I learned so much about myself." Grainger took a two-year break from rowing after winning Olympic gold at London 2012, following silver medals at Sydney, Athens and Beijing. But after a selection ordeal where her place was only confirmed six weeks beforehand, she won double sculls silver with Victoria Thornley in Rio. "We have absolutely amazing experts behind the scenes in strength and conditioning, training and coaching," she added. "They reassured me from when I started again knowing that I could still be in fantastic physical shape and my strength and fitness wouldn't be the limiting factor come racing. "It was hard and it was sore - we put everything on the line to get in amongst the medals. "We were racing against the odds as much as we were the opposition as we hadn't really shown the form all season to get on to the Olympic podium. "So we committed very, very early to the race physically, and countered every challenge that came at us from the opposition. "We were in a leading position until right before the end. "When you have got the Polish team that went on to win gold, attacking and coming through us, we were trying everything physically to counter them. "You just know you have run out of options physically - we left everything that we had out on the lake."	Five-time Olympic medallist Katherine Grainger has revealed how her grounding in karate at school has had a profound influence on her rowing career.
Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reported 2,405 insolvencies between April and June - 7.8% up on the previous quarter. There were 1,144 bankruptcies, which was up 14.7% on the previous quarter and 51.1% more than a year ago. However, AiB said the figures showed a "return to trend". A year ago, the number of personal insolvencies in Scotland fell to its lowest level for more than 14 years following the introduction of the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Act. The legislation introduced new measures such as mandatory money advice for people seeking access to statutory debt relief solutions such as sequestration. Although the latest bankruptcy figures were sharply up on a year ago, they were 41.7% lower than the same quarter in 2013-14 and 34.9% lower than in 2014-15. Personal insolvencies include both bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs). The number of PTDs recorded between April and June remained largely stable at 1,261, a 2.1% increase from the previous quarter. New debt payment programmes approved under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) fell slightly by 5.2% on the previous quarter, to 510. Quarterly figures for bankruptcies and PTDs since 2005-06: Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "These figures indicate that people are becoming more accustomed to the new insolvency legislation and processes. "We are now seeing the numbers settling down to a more regular pattern following the significant, and expected, drop after the introduction of the new laws. "Compared to the same quarter from two years ago, prior to these changes, the number of people falling into insolvency today is down by more than a third. "This shows those most in need can access the debt relief they require to help them on the road to a fresh financial start - but also that the long term movement is a downward one." Eileen Blackburn, from insolvency trade body R3, said: "This quarterly rise, driven mostly by an increase in bankruptcies, bucks the wider downward trend in Scottish personal insolvencies we've seen in past years. "The number of insolvencies have been falling steadily since their peak in 2012, and this quarter represents a return to more stable levels. "The rise is probably less do with the EU referendum result, which only happened towards the very end of the quarter, and more to do with ongoing difficulties in the Scottish economy and the end of the financial year in March."	Personal insolvency numbers have returned to "relative stability" in Scotland following the introduction last year of new bankruptcy legislation, according to officials.
The Music Group said a consultation on redundancies at its Tannoy loudspeaker production facility in Coatbridge began on Tuesday. The consultation will last for at least 30 days, according to the company. Production of audio equipment at the plant is understood to be moving to China. Tannoy is one of the oldest audio brands in the world, having been founded as the Tulsemere Manufacturing Company in 1926. It has had a base in Coatbridge since the 1970s. The company remains active in a range of audio sectors including residential hi-fi and studio monitoring. Peter Sommer, senior vice president of lifestyle at The Music Group, said: "I can confirm that Music does propose to dismiss as redundant around 70 staff at its manufacturing and office facility in Coatbridge. "However, I would emphasize that no final decision has been taken in relation to these proposals, which are the subject of a detailed collective consultation process which began on Tuesday 3 May 2016 and which will last for at least 30 days and possibly more. "In the event that the proposed dismissals are ultimately confirmed following the conclusion of the consultation process, the Coatbridge facility would cease operations and the plant would close. "Given that the proposals are at a formative stage, there is of course no definitive time scale in place, but it is envisaged that any closure would likely be towards the end of the year." He added: "Music is of course mindful of its obligation to seek out any suitable alternative employment for any employees whom it is confirmed are to be made redundant, and to that end the company will be doing all that it can to try to identify any suitable alternative roles which may exist in any of its operations in Europe and beyond." Mick Conroy, GMB Scotland senior officer, said: "In the year of Tannoy's 90th anniversary, it's an absolute tragedy that the long-serving Coatbridge workforce has been rewarded with the sack. "These latest redundancies also show the total free-fall in Scotland's manufacturing sector as our slide towards a low-skill, low-wage and precarious economy gathers apace without any intervention. "A key priority of the next Scottish government must be to address our manufacturing crisis by bringing forward a meaningful industrial strategy that can help steer our economy back towards growth."	The owners of an audio manufacturing factory in North Lanarkshire have confirmed that the plant is facing closure, with the loss of 70 jobs.
The prosecution was brought by the RSPCA following a raid at a puppy farm at a traveller site in Essex. Teresa Wade, 57, Victoria Montgomery, 54, her daughter Roxanne Montgomery, 33 and Tony Hammond, 34, admitted fraud at Basildon Crown Court. The gang, from Essex and east London, will be sentenced later. Live: For more on this and other Essex stories All four admitted handling about 750 puppies between July 2013 and October 2014. The court heard the animals were sold for an average of £450 each and the RSPCA estimates the fraud was worth more than £300,000. The court was shown video footage shot by the RSPCA of dozens of cockerpoo (a cocker spaniel and poodle crossbreed) puppies kept in cages inside dark sheds near South Ockendon. The dogs - some barely two weeks old - had soiled newspapers for bedding, no toys and some had no heating. Teresa Wade, of Ship Lane, Aveley, South Ockendon, admitted advertising them over the internet as being home-reared, and that they were shown to prospective buyers at houses belonging to the other defendants, before being sold for up to £750 each in cash. But some of the animals were so sick they died shortly after arriving at their new homes, or cost their new owners thousands of pounds in vet bills. Wade will be sentenced later along with Victoria Montgomery, of Melford Avenue, Dagenham, and Hammond and Roxanne Montgomery, both of Grafton Raod, Dagenham.	Three women and a man have admitted fraud in connection with the sale of hundreds of puppies, some of which died or suffered serious health problems.
Shyam Acharya is accused of stealing a doctor's name and qualifications in India before moving to Australia. He used the credentials to work in local hospitals between 2003 and 2014, New South Wales (NSW) Health said. He also became an Australian citizen. Mr Acharya was never the individual subject of a complaint. He is facing a fine of up to A$30,000 (Â£18,600; $18,700) but is likely to have left Australia, said NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard on Wednesday. "It is quite disturbing that a foreign national could get through our border protection with a false passport and ID based on an Indian citizen who had trained as a doctor," Mr Hazzard said in a statement. Local media reported the false identity was that of Sarang Chitale, a doctor who had previously worked in India. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) notified NSW Health it was investigating Mr Acharya in November last year. He worked at four New South Wales (NSW) public hospitals - two in Sydney, and two on the state's central coast - before his employment ended in 2014. NSW Health deputy secretary Karen Crawshaw said he was classified as a junior doctor, meaning he was supervised by other practitioners. Although never the sole target of a complaint, Mr Acharya was part of a clinical team investigated over the treatment of one patient. Mr Hazzard said he would offer to meet with the patient, who had been told of the alleged deception. Australian police and immigration officials are investigating how Mr Acharya was awarded citizenship. "The belief is that he actually trained in a medical course, possibly in India," Mr Hazzard told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. "Whether he actually completed that qualification is a moot point." NSW Health said the registration process for doctors had undergone significant changes since 2003. Mr Hazzard said he would examine "every aspect of registration" to prevent any future breaches.	A man who allegedly masqueraded as a doctor in Australian hospitals for over a decade is believed to have left the country, authorities have said.
Gwen Thomson, 51, from Torry, died after the accident on Market Street on Wednesday morning. Insp Jon Barron said: "Our thoughts are very much with Gwen's family, friends and work colleagues at this very sad time." The 60-year-old male lorry driver was uninjured. Police Scotland thanked those who helped at the scene. Insp Barron added: "We have spoken to a number of witnesses to the incident already.  However, I would urge anyone who hasn't yet been in contact with us to do so in order to help piece together exactly what happened."	A woman who died after being knocked down by an HGV in Aberdeen city centre has been named.
Yanagihara's novel, the story of four college friends seeking fame and fortune in New York, is tipped to win by bookmakers William Hill and Coral. It is the second year the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall at around 21:45 BST. This year's shortlist features two authors from the UK, two from the US and one each from Jamaica and Nigeria. The shortlist of authors and titles is as follows: Victory for either Yanagihara or Tyler would see the Man Booker have its first American winner. Marlon James is the first Jamaican-born author to be shortlisted for the prize. William Hill said his novel, which explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in the late 1970s, had moved up from fifth favourite to second favourite. This year's judges are Michael Wood (chair),  Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, John Burnside, Sam Leith and Frances Osborne.  They considered 156 books for this year's prize. McCarthy is the only shortlisted author to have been nominated before, having been shortlisted for C in 2010. At 28 years old, Obioma is the youngest nominee, the same age as 2013 winner Eleanor Catton. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The winner will receive a further cheque for £50,000. Australian author Richard Flanagan won last year's prize for his wartime novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, will be on the BBC News Channel from 21:30 BST.	The winner of the Man Booker Prize is announced shortly with Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life the bookies' favourite to take the £50,000 prize.
Bus use has been falling across the UK since 2008 but the drop has been sharpest in Wales. The Welsh government puts Â£25m a year into supporting bus services - a quarter less than in 2013. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the level of cuts could be "devastating". "If the cuts are of the scale of what's been mentioned by George Osborne - we're talking 25 to 40%," the WLGA's transport spokesman Andrew Morgan said. "You take 40% of funding away from non-protected services like bus services then we're talking about probably another three, four, five per cent of all bus services in Wales will end up being withdrawn." Kevyn Jones, managing director of Cardiff-based bus operator New Adventure Travel, said about half the routes he ran received some subsidy, but he expected the numbers to reduce in the future. "The subsidised services are dwindling each year. There's less this year than there was last year and the same each year for the last five years we've been operating them," he added. A Welsh government spokesperson said: "These grants are intended to supplement local authorities' expenditure on bus services and it is a matter for them how that funding is allocated. "Under the concessionary bus travel scheme local authorities are responsible for determining the reimbursement rate for bus operators and for ensuring that operators are no better and no worse off." Hear more on Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales, Sunday 18 October at 12:30 BST.	Bus services in Wales could be dramatically cut as a result of the UK government's spending review next month, it has been warned.
The organisers of Common People commissioned the inflatable structure for the event on Southampton Common on Saturday and Sunday. The castle, measuring 23.8m by 20.7m by 12.8m, is taller than the Great Wall of China and can be used by 100 people. It will also appear at the organisers' other festivals - Bestival on the Isle of Wight and Camp Bestival in Dorset. Festival organiser Rob da Bank said: "We do love breaking a record and this is one of our funnest builds so far." There is currently no record for the world's biggest bouncy castle. Guinness World Records is yet to verify the record. Common People, now in its second year, features Duran Duran, Primal Scream, Craig David and Public Enemy. For the first time, a simultaneous event is also being held in South Parks, Oxford. The current record for a bouncy castle was set in 1997 by Dana Caspersen and William Forsythe, the festival said. The castle, measuring 19m by 19m by 12m, took six hours to erect at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London.	Festival-goers are being invited to have a go on what is claimed to be the world's largest bouncy castle.
Media playback is not supported on this device Flower, 26, punched Hohaia to the ground two minutes into Saturday's Grand Final, then landed a second blow to his face while he lay on the ground. Wales prop Flower was sent off as the Warriors were beaten 14-6. The ban until 14 April takes in 10 Super League games and the World Club Series match against Brisbane Broncos. New Zealander Hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before Flower's punches. Flower was charged with a Grade F offence - the most serious in the sport's disciplinary rules - of "violent and aggressive punching" and "punching an off-guard opponent", a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban. Wigan rugby general manager Kris Radlinski, who accompanied Flower to the hearing at the Rugby Football League in Leeds, said in a statement: "Wigan Warriors would like to go on record in saying that the RFL disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity. "We fully support their assessment of Saturday night's incident involving our player, Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal. "We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and his family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens' win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong." In becoming the first man to be sent off in a Grand Final, Flower left his side down to 12 men for the vast majority of the match at Old Trafford, which St Helens won to end an eight-year wait for the Super League title. Saints chairman Eamonn McManus said: "The sport of rugby league should not be judged by this event, but by how it deals with it. "We must assist [Flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one." For Wigan, the defeat ended their defence of the Super League crown and the pursuit of a fourth title. Former Wigan and Great Britain player Martin Offiah told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is a lot of emotion around what was a big occasion but sadly it was in effect ruined by this incident in which I believe both players played their part. It was a sad day for rugby league. "The sport was on show, it's a big event and the pictures are very graphic and all the apologies in the world won't wipe these away. "No one can condone that second punch to the head and he's apologised for that but Lance Hohaia must take some consideration for his actions." Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police said in a tweet they are investigating "abusive social media activity" surrounding the Grand Final.	Wigan prop Ben Flower has been given a six-month ban - the longest in Super League history - for punching St Helens' Lance Hohaia.

British artists have scooped several nominations for the 2015 Grammys.
Media playback is not supported on this device Australia, seeking a fourth successive World T20 title, chose to bat and posted 148-5, with Elyse Villani making the first half century in a final. But 18-year-old Windies opener Hayley Matthews hit a stunning 66 off 45 balls with three sixes, in a stand of 120. The Windies won with three balls to spare and their men's team later completed a T20 double. West Indies had lost all of their eight previous T20 internationals against Australia and in their first final they made a nervous start bowling at the iconic Eden Gardens. Villani (52) seized on some wayward full tosses to reach her fifty from 34 balls. Australia skipper Meg Lanning hit three successive fours in her 52 and the elegant Ellyse Perry dispatched two glorious straight drives for six in a cameo 28. Having fought back by conceding only a single from the final over they bowled, the Windies made a slow start to their reply, scoring three from the first two overs. Media playback is not supported on this device But Matthews and skipper Stafanie Taylor hit 16 from the fifth over, bowled by Perry, and recorded their century partnership in the 14th over. Matthews was caught with 29 more runs required from 26 balls and Taylor's 59 ended with only five left to score from eight deliveries. Three were needed from the final over and victory was secured after a routine run-out opportunity turned into an overthrow, to spark exuberant West Indian celebrations, joined by the men's team who were arriving for their final with England. It continued a welcome resurgence for West Indian cricket, after the Under-19 team beat India to win the 50-over World Cup in February. West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor: "I've been waiting for this a long time and it has come at the right time. "We didn't get the start we wanted but the batting has done it for us. "It was fantastic to know that the men were with us. [Men's captain Darren] Sammy sent me a text this morning 'Staf you are going to do it, you girls you are going to do it'." Media playback is not supported on this device Australia skipper Meg Lanning: "Full credit to the West Indies, they came out with the bat, and we did not quite get the result we wanted. "We felt we were a little short, 160 would have been nice, but if we bowled well we would have defended. "It was a really exciting, tough road into the World Cup and I am proud of the effort that everyone has put in." Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special: "The Windies have brought power into this tournament. "Hayley Matthews running down the wicket and hitting Ellyse Perry for six was probably the moment of the tournament. "They have discipline in their game now. If this team can tighten up with the bowling and handle pressure they will be a dangerous force going forward."	West Indies claimed their first Women's World Twenty20 with a pulsating eight-wicket win over Australia in Kolkata.
When Claire was told she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair after a spinal injury, she wanted to get back on her feet as quickly as possible and regain her independence. For the past three months she has been training intensively for the marathon using a robotic walking suit to prove she is just as determined as in her sporting days. When Claire sets out with participants on Sunday she knows that most will aim to finish in hours. For her, it will take about three weeks. A former event-rider who had competed at the highest level, Claire thought that the Burghley Horse trials, a four-star horse-riding event for top-class riders in Stamford, Lincolnshire, would be her greatest test. "I didn't think I'd ever get to that level. But the marathon is a bigger challenge. I was wrong." In the beginning she could only take two steps. Just a few weeks ago, she could only walk 30, making the marathon a near impossible feat. But Claire's sporting background has provided her with the resilience she needs to keep going. Following gruelling training sessions three times a week at a Yorkshire clinic, she can now cover longer distances of up to a mile in one session. It takes at least two-and-a-half hours for her to complete a mile but she hopes to improve her speed as the weeks pass, staying in a hotel at night-time and starting afresh every morning from the point where she left off the night before. In 2006, Claire's horse Rolled Oats clipped his shoulder, flinging her from the saddle into a nearby tree. The fall broke her neck, back and ribs and left her paralysed from the chest down. Claire first saw the "robot legs", or ReWalk bionic walking device, while researching her condition on the internet. She jokingly likens the device to Wallace and Gromit's "wrong trousers", and with the help of her friends and family raised the £43,000 necessary to get them. But walking in "techno trousers" is not as quite as easy as in the Nick Park animation - while the "wrong trousers" walk on their own, Claire's require patience, perseverance and intense effort. She says: "Not feeling my body makes it so hard. I don't know what my feet are doing." Claire relies on motion sensors to help her move and lift her legs and one of the most difficult things for her has been simply learning to stand on two feet again. "To start with I just had to find my balance without wobbling." The London marathon is not the only race Claire is competing in, as she and her one-year-old daughter, Maisie, are battling it out to see who will be the first to walk unaided. "We've had this competition all along so we'll see. She can do 10 steps on her own now. I'm as wobbly as her." Claire hopes to raise more than £50,000 for Spinal Research, a charity which funds medical research to develop treatments for paralysis. Former rugby player Matt Hampson, who was paralysed after a rugby accident, will provide moral support for part of her marathon journey, as will retired tennis player Tim Henman and former champion British equestrian Lucinda Green. "There's a lot of people who are worse off than me and haven't got the support I've got, so I want to raise as much as I can." But, when the marathon is over, Claire thinks that for the first time in six years, she will be delighted to return to her wheelchair.	Six years ago, professional horse-rider Claire Lomas was told that she would never walk again but now she is attempting to walk more than 26 miles (42km) at Sunday's London Marathon thanks to a pair of "robot legs", which have transformed her life.
The event takes place at East Kirkcarswell Farm near Dundrennan on 25 and 26 July. Dizzee Rascal will headline the opening night in his only Scottish festival appearance of the year. Organisers have also unveiled a string of other acts including Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, The Zombies, Big Country and The Feeling. Wickerman Festival co-ordinator Helen Chalmers said she was "thrilled" to be revealing the first acts. "We are delighted that Dizzee Rascal will be joining the party this year, his live performances are incredible and I can't wait to see the crowd's reaction to his headline set," she said. "From hip hop, pop, folk to Motown and alternative rock, this year's line-up will once again be a truly diverse offering. "We look forward to announcing further exciting additions including our Saturday night headliner over the coming weeks."	Rapper Dizzee Rascal has been announced as one of the headline acts at this year's Wickerman Festival.

Although the EY Item Club think tank predicts the economy will grow 1.9% this year, it expects that performance to fizzle out as inflation rises. The economy's stability since June's Brexit vote was "deceptive", EY said. Meanwhile, a senior Bank of England official told the BBC that inflation may surpass its 2% target. In an interview to be broadcast on Monday, the Bank's deputy governor Ben Broadbent told Radio 5 live that sterling's weakness would fuel inflation, but that controlling prices with tighter monetary policy could hit growth and jobs. The dilemma facing policymakers was underlined in the Item Club report. It expects inflation to jump to 2.6% next year before easing back to 1.8% in 2018. That will cause growth in consumer spending to slow from an expected 2.5% this year to 0.5% in 2017 and 0.9% the year after, the report said. Business investment is also forecast to fall due to uncertainty surrounding Britain's future trading relationship with the EU, dropping 1.5% this year and more than 2% in 2017. EY predicts that the impact of weaker consumer spending and falling investment will cause UK GDP growth to drop sharply to 0.8% next year, before expanding to 1.4% in 2018. Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: "So far it might look like the economy is taking Brexit in its stride, but this picture is deceptive. "Sterling's shaky performance this month provides a timely reminder that challenges lie ahead. As inflation returns over the winter it will squeeze household incomes and spending. "The pressure on consumers and the cautious approach to spending by businesses mean that the UK is facing a period of relatively low growth," he said. The report said that exporters will benefit from the depreciation of sterling, which last week tumbled against a basket of currencies. Exports will increase by 4.5% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018, EY forecast. But Mr Spencer did not expect this to be enough to offset a wider slowdown. "With activity in the domestic market flat, GDP growth will become heavily dependent upon exports next year," he said. "But once the UK has left the EU certain sectors, such as aerospace, automotive, and chemicals that trade extensively with the EU will be a lot more vulnerable and may need to be supported by subsidies and more robust industrial policies," he said. Some of the economic challenges were spelled out in Mr Broadbent's BBC interview with 5 live's Sean Farrington. The deputy governor, echoing remark's by the Bank's governor Mark Carney last week, said that letting inflation run ahead of the 2% target might ensure the economy does not suffer. Tighter monetary policy to meet the target could lead to "undesirable consequences" such as lower growth and higher unemployment, he said. It's a "trade off", he added.	Britain's economy faces a "prolonged period" of weaker growth as consumer spending slows and business curbs investment, according to a report.
Josh Vela fired Bolton in front from eight yards after Emile Heskey laid Dean Moxey's long throw into his path. But Boro equalised when Rhodes, who was about to be replaced by David Nugent, drilled home from close range. Rhodes then headed in Middlesbrough's second stoppage-time winner this week from three yards. Minutes earlier, Boro's big-money transfer deadline day signing from Blackburn had hit the post and headed wide from six yards as the Teessiders sought a winner, while substitute Gaston Ramirez also scooped a shot over from close range. Relive Middlesbrough's win at Bolton But Rhodes was in the right place at the right time to nod in Nugent's cross in the first minute of injury time and leave Boro two points clear at the top after promotion rivals Burnley, who they face on Tuesday, won 2-1 at Birmingham. Boro, who have now won six successive games, also scored an injury-time winner to beat Reading in midweek and this late show secured only their second victory at Bolton's current home. Middlesbrough face promotion rivals Burnley and Brighton in their closing four games and, as such, have their fate in their own hands as they bid to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2009. Aitor Karanka's side dominated the first half in terms of chances as Stewart Downing hit the bar from 25 yards, while Adam Forshaw, Daniel Ayala, Albert Adomah and Ritchie de Laet all failed to hit to target. Mark Davies' backheel forced Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos into a save from Bolton's best first-half opening. Wanderers looked set for only their fifth win of the season after Vela put them in front but Rhodes had the final say to the delight of Boro's 4,302 travelling fans. Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: "I told him [Rhodes] after the game that a goalscorer can't forget to score goals in two months. "Always one day it would arrive that he would score goals and it was today - two important goals. "I don't think it's been easy for him. He's not a strong character, you can see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when you do your best and you're unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting himself. "Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the team." Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips: "That's [the level of performance] got to be the case from now until the end of the season. "We encourage players to get on the ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive edge and defensive shape. "There's still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set the players up for next season for those that are going to be here."

Edinburgh University found chronic pain is caused partly by a person's genetic make-up and partly by as-yet-unidentified risk factors shared by partners in the same environment. The team also identified significant overlaps between the risk factors for chronic pain and depression. The scientists said chronic pain is a common cause of disability. Scientists hope the research will help explain why some people suffer from the condition and not others. The study used data from more than 100,000 people taking part in the Generation Scotland and UK Biobank projects - major studies investigating genetic links to health conditions. The results of the collaboration with Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow universities are published in the latest edition of the journal PLOS Medicine. Prof Andrew McIntosh, chair of biological psychiatry at Edinburgh University, said: "We hope our research will encourage people to think about the relationship between chronic pain and depression, and whether physical and mental illnesses are as separate as some believe."	Partners of people with depression are more likely to suffer from chronic pain, a new study suggests.
Choupo-Moting, 28, is their fourth signing of the summer after Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma and Josh Tymon. "Eric has been on our radar for several years and we actually tried to bring him to the club four years ago," chief executive Tony Scholes said. Stoke open their Premier League season with a trip to Everton on Saturday. Choupo-Moting, who has also played for Hamburg and Mainz, has made 200 Bundesliga appearances and played in the Champions League with Schalke. A former Germany youth international, he switched international allegiance to Cameroon in 2010. He represented the Indomitable Lions at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and has won 48 caps, scoring 13 goals. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Stoke City have signed Cameroon winger Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a three-year deal after his contract ran out at German club Schalke.
Redmond, an England Under-21 international, has agreed a five-year contract with the Saints. Norwich, who were relegated from the Premier League in May, signed the 22-year-old from Birmingham City for £3.2m in July 2013. "They like to play attacking football and it's a style I feel I can really fit in well with," Redmond said. "When Southampton said they were interested, it felt like the right move for me. I can develop my game here." Birmingham-born Redmond made 122 appearances and scored 13 goals during his three-year spell with Norwich. Redmond has played at every youth level for England, playing alongside Saints trio James Ward-Prowse, Jack Stephens and Matt Targett for England Under-21s at the Toulon Tournament earlier this summer. Southampton are without a manager following Dutchman Ronald Koeman's departure to Everton.	Southampton have signed Norwich City winger Nathan Redmond for undisclosed fee believed to be worth £10m.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Alan King-trained seven-year-old, a 16-1 shot, led all the way for the 19-time Champion jockey, who is retiring this season. Ma Filleule (5-1) was second with 5-2 favourite Don Cossack third. McCoy said: "I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him." The Northern Irishman did not seem to fancy his chances much pre-race, but trainer King's seven-year-old put in some spectacular leaps on the way round. "I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase," said McCoy after his victory. "He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up but I was quite happy coming down the hill." McCoy's wife Chanelle and several of his family members were waiting in the winner's enclosure to greet him after his victory. "He wanted that feeling one more time," said Chanelle. "Heading into day three he wanted one more time to ride a winner at Cheltenham, to soak up the atmosphere and not finish his career without one more winner."	AP McCoy won his first race of his final Cheltenham Festival on day three, riding Uxizandre to victory in the Ryanair Chase.
The clip, filmed in Norwich city centre, shows two men coming to blows in front of a stationary bus at the corner of Prince of Wales Road and Upper King Street. Both are seen grappling on the pavement before more punches are thrown. Bus operator Stagecoach said a driver had been suspended. No arrests have been made. In the video, the bus driver picks up what appears to be a badge from the middle of the street. For more Norfolk stories, visit the BBC's Local Live page for the county He returns to the bus, and the two men continue to trade insults. Andy Campbell, managing director of Stagecoach East, confirmed a bus driver had been suspended. "We understand on-street video footage of part of the incident has subsequently been posted on social media", he said. The company will launch its own investigation, and help police with their enquiries, he added. Norfolk Police said they were called to Prince of Wales Road just before 16:00 BST on Wednesday. They located one of the men when they arrived at the scene and were appealing for witnesses.	Footage of a street brawl which appears to involve a bus driver has been shared on social media.

England's Chris Wood (66) was fourth on 13 under, one shot clear of Italy's Francesco Molinari (74), who was tied for the lead with An overnight. The 23-year-old An's win is his first on one of the world's major tours. An was the youngest-ever winner of the US Amateur Championship in 2009, at the age of 17. Media playback is not supported on this device He became only the third European Tour rookie to win the prestigious PGA Championship in its 60-year history and his 267 total over four rounds also beat the tournament record by two shots. His victory, the first time the European Tour's flagship event has been won by an Asian, will see him climb into the world's top 60, secured his place in the US Open and Open Championship and a five-year exemption in Europe. "It's going to be life changing," said An, the son of two Olympic table-tennis medallists - his mother Jiao Zhimin represented China and his father Ahn Jae Hyung competed for South Korea. "This is the biggest event on the European Tour and there are a lot of benefits. I played really well today and had all the confidence going into the last couple of holes." An began the final round tied for the lead with Molinari and, despite picking up shots at the second and fourth, was only one ahead at the turn thanks to a hat-trick of birdies from Jaidee from the fifth. However, a birdie at the 11th and tap-in eagle at the 12th gave An a three-shot cushion that became four when Jaidee bogeyed the 13th. An made certain of victory with birdies on the 15th and 17th and a par on the last completed a hugely impressive performance from the Challenge Tour graduate. Bristol's Wood had a hole in one at the 14th, winning himself a car from the sponsors in the process.	South Korea's Byeong-hun An carded a final-round, seven-under-par 65 to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
The cloning of the first animal from an adult cell was a remarkable scientific achievement. It promised new treatments for debilitating diseases. But it also raised fears of cloned human beings, designer babies and a dystopian future. Twenty years on, neither the hopes nor the fears have been realised. So what is Dolly's legacy? I first saw Dolly in 1997 at the Roslin Institute just outside Edinburgh. She stood apart from the other sheep in the pens at this agricultural research centre. She stood prouder, her fleece seemed like a lion's mane and there was an aura about her. Dolly's creation had echoes of Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which inanimate tissue was brought to life by electricity. Dolly was created from DNA taken from a cell taken from an sheep. The technique involved putting the DNA into an empty eggshell and then zapping it with electricity. This created an embryo. Researchers at Roslin then implanted the embryo into the womb of a sheep which grew into Dolly - an exact genetic copy of the sheep from which the skin cell was taken. It took 277 attempts to clone Dolly and there were many miscarriages on the way. There were also genuine concerns that it would not be long before cloned humans would be walking the Earth - people would try to clone themselves to achieve a kind of immortality or they might try to resurrect a beloved dead relative. The airwaves were filled with conversations about what it meant to be human, whether the clones would be exactly the same as the person from which they were cloned and what kind of world the scientists were tumbling us into. When I met the researchers at Roslin they were acutely aware of public suspicion. And they knew it was important to be clear, open and honest about their work. Dolly's creator, Prof Sir Ian Wilmut, could not be any more different from fictional scientists such as Dr Frankenstein or indeed Dr Moreau, who developed human-like hybrids in a story by HG Wells. By contrast, Prof Wilmut is a quietly-spoken man whose motivation was to improve animal welfare and human health. This bespectacled scientist with his gentle candour was ideally complemented by the enthusiastic and eloquent Dr Simon Best, who was brought in to commercialise the technology to improve human health. A former manager of the early 1980s pop group The Human League turned biotechnology pioneer, Prof Best knew how to sell a good story and do so with panache. Between them they quickly changed the narrative from that of a nightmare future to one in which cloning was used to treat many incurable diseases. Prof Wilmut and Dr Best promoted the term "therapeutic cloning". Their vision was to develop treatments for heart disease, Parkinson's Disease and rheumatism by taking cells from patients and using cloning technology to create healthy tissues which could then be transplanted to heal their damaged cells. This raised further concerns from some church and anti-abortion groups, who were concerned that the process involved the creation, and then destruction, of human embryos. They wanted the technology banned but, following strong lobbying by the medical research community, parliament permitted therapeutic cloning but banned the cloning of human beings. Since then, the much hoped-for benefits from therapeutic cloning have not emerged. Some groups in the UK are cloning tissues from patients to study diseases and test drugs. But no so-called cell-replacement treatments have yet been developed. However, important scientific breakthroughs can - and usually do - take time to have an impact. Dolly's legacy is to show scientists that animal cells can be reprogrammed. They can be rejuvenated and redirected to form any cell in the human body. Scientists may not have reaped the clinical benefits just yet but, at a stroke, Dolly's birth changed scientific thinking forever. It is hard to imagine how this incredible biological insight won't alter the world fundamentally and in ways we have yet to imagine.	The birth of Dolly the sheep seemed one of those moments in scientific research that would change the world forever.
He had back surgery for the second time in 18 months in September and talked about retirement earlier this month. Now the former world number one, who is 40 on 30 December, hopes to play competitively again early in 2016. "Where do I see myself in the next five to 10 years? I am still playing golf at the highest level, winning tournaments and majors," he wrote on his website. Woods spent a record total of 683 weeks as world number one but has not won a tournament since the Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013. He is now ranked 414th and won the last of his 14 majors in 2008. Asked about entering his fifth decade, he said: "Mentally, people who know me know I'm like a five-year-old. "Physically, sometimes I feel old and sometimes I feel like a teenager. I don't like the polar opposites of the two. I'd like to be somewhere in the middle where I feel 40. "The thing I'm looking forward to the most about 2016 is getting back out there again. I've missed it, and I would like to do it pain-free. "I've had it in spurts the last few years and have done some pretty good things, but I'd like to have sustained health." Woods was named as an assistant by US captain Davis Love III for next year's Ryder Cup in Minnesota but said he is still aiming for a more prominent role against  Europe at the Hazeltine National Golf Club. "Hopefully, I'll be able to play my way on to the team," he said. "Either way, I'm excited about being an assistant captain. It will be new, fun and special. "To have Davis appoint and trust me is pretty special. "If you look back to when we played together in 1999 at Brookline, I don't think either one of us would have foreseen this."	Tiger Woods is back in upbeat mood and expecting to win major championships over the next decade.
A new report published by the corporation showed licence money spending had a positive knock-on effect for regional economies. The total expenditure over the two-year period came to £4.3bn, which led to a gross value-added (GVA) boost to the economy of £8.3bn. However, spending in London was three times the rest of the UK combined. The report said: "The effect of initial BBC spending is 'multiplied' as it ripples through the economy from region to region and sector to sector (and to the employees of those sectors). This is known as the 'multiplier effect'." The BBC's chief economic and policy adviser Najma Rajah explained: "The basic premise is that when the BBC spends a pound, the impact of that pound is 'multiplied' as that pound spent by the BBC creates value elsewhere in the economy. "So, for example, if the BBC were to buy a camera from a supplier in Manchester, the camera supplier would receive some money in return for the camera. "The camera company would then use the income generated from the sale of the camera to pay their suppliers for the components that went into the camera and to also pay their employees and so on." Rajah added: "A really good example of how this multiplier effect works is when the BBC commissions a programme that is made by an independent television production. "The programme might be filmed in Scotland using local runners, electricians, make-up artists etc. who are paid and then will spend their wages in Scotland to the benefit of the Scottish economy." The report revealed significant growth in the north of England following the opening of the new BBC North headquarters in Salford Quays, with GVA growing 19.7% to £391m. But in the Midlands, it fell 21.7% to £199m, while the south was down 18.8% to £699m and Wales dropped 6.2% to £276m. London saw the biggest expenditure of £2.98bn - nearly three times as much as the rest of the UK combined - which in turn generated £5.65bn GVA. John Tate, the BBC's director of policy and strategy, used the findings of the report to call on Ofcom to reverse its plans for a spectrum tax on broadcasters next year. In a blog post he wrote:  "The wider benefit of the licence fee provides an extra reason for Ofcom to think again before it implements a spectrum tax next year: a levy on the spectrum broadcasters use to transmit their programmes. "As well as hitting licence fee payers, such a tax would remove much-needed cash from the UK's creative sector."	The BBC generated more than £8bn for the UK economy in 2011-12, almost twice its licence fee spend.
A post-mortem examination found that Mr Hunter, from Coulsdon in south London, died from a single gunshot wound at the private event in Headley, near Epsom. Two other people were also injured in the shooting shortly after 02:30 BST on Monday. A 36-year-old woman was shot in the leg and taken to hospital while another man was treated for minor shoulder wounds. A man from London, 38, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder remains in custody. A woman, 30, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been released on conditional bail until September, police said. Specialist divers have been searching a village pond for the gun used in the shooting, while forensic teams are continuing a detailed examination of the address in Church Lane. More than 400 people were at the party at the hired house. The annual event had been organised by reggae dancehall artist Jason White and his girlfriend Summerlyn Farquharson. He told BBC Newsbeat they used seven security staff with metal detectors to check all the guests as they arrived. Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: "This was a shocking incident where a man lost his life and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice." He said police intended to speak to everyone who was at the party, and appealed for anyone not already contacted to come forward. "This incident has understandably sent shockwaves through the Headley community and we are working with our Safer Neighbourhood Team colleagues to update and reassure residents," he said. "We do not believe there is any ongoing risk to Headley residents."	A man who died during a shooting at a pool party in Surrey has been named as 34-year-old Ricardo Hunter.
Only bottom-club Rotherham have conceded more goals in the last 10 minutes than Cardiff. "The late goals are frustrating I am sure for the fans, but is devastating for especially a defender, all of us in the back four," he said. "It is something we have to improve on, the whole team, not just the back four. We have to see games out." Cardiff have conceded almost 30% of their goals between 80-90 minutes this season, including in their last three games. The Bluebirds were held by Birmingham last time out as Lukas Jutkiewicz bundled in a rebound after his header was saved. Cardiff also conceded an injury-time equaliser against Blackburn, while defeat at QPR in their previous fixture came courtesy of an 83rd-minute own goal by Jazz Richards. "The last couple of games we have controlled and then let slip right at the end," said Morrison. "We need to learn lessons now for next season, which is what the gaffer is trying to build on, finishing well this year." Morrison also says the whole team has a responsibility to improve their "game management". "It does start from the front, it is not just the defenders and a goalkeeper," he said. "It is game management, one of the boys made a good point yesterday. He said 'we can win a game 1-0'. "You don't have to win two or three; you don't get any more points for scoring an extra goal. "And there are certain periods in the game we just need to see it out. "That nous and knowhow is down to us, the players. It just hasn't been good enough. "It is hugely disappointing and something we know we have to improve on, from now until the end of the season and then next year." Ahead of hosting Ipswich on Saturday 18 March, Cardiff boss Neil Warnock said he is enjoying "weekly" meetings to discuss transfer targets for next season. However, Morrison believes knowing that Warnock has grand plans to strengthen City is only going to have a positive effect on the current squad. "We know there will probably be new faces next year so it is about building a solid base to give it a right good go. "Maybe we are driven by knowing new players are coming in. I just think that is what the football industry is. "I have never been at a club where there aren't new signings every year. "You are always wary that if they come in, in your position, they are going to be a 'liked' player. "It is just one of those things you need to take on the chin. It is business, it is football and if you have to fight for your position, that's football. "If you do well week in week out, you probably won't lose your spot."	Captain Sean Morrison says late goals have been "devastating" for Cardiff City's back four.
Portugal are top of their qualifying group for Euro 2016 but rested Ronaldo against the African side, who are ranked 38th in the world. Odair Fortes put Cape Verde ahead before Admilson Gege doubled their lead after the break. The hosts also had defender Andre Pinto sent off after an hour. Cape Verde - eliminated at the group stage of this year's Africa Cup of Nations - are sandwiched between Wales and Scotland in Fifa's world rankings.

The 29-year-old was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and wounding with intent. Previously, a 30-year-old, 27-year-old and 20-year-old, all from Rugby, were arrested. All four men have been bailed until the end of April. It follows an incident on Oxford Street on 17 March in which a 17-year-old was shot and an 18-year-old knifed. More on this and other Warwickshire stories	Police investigating a shooting and stabbing in Rugby have arrested a fourth man.
The former Nottingham Forest defender signed for struggling Longford AFC in January in a bid to end its season-long losing streak and 178-goal deficit. He was due to get his boots on for the Gloucestershire non-leaguers last month, but the match was called off. A club spokesman said with Pearce on side, it was hoping to get its "very first win of the season" on Saturday. Rooted to the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, Longford AFC has lost all its games this season and conceded nearly 200 goals - earning it the name of "the worst team in England". But following their star January signing, club treasurer Mike Dean said the squad had been training hard and "games haven't been as bad". "We went down to Bisham Abbey - the old England stomping ground - a couple of weeks ago with Stuart and were training down there for about two-and-a-half hours," he said. "We have been getting beat but the scores are only 1-0, 2-0 - very low now.  So things are getting better and the confidence is in the side." On Saturday, 53-year-old Pearce - nicknamed Psycho - will be turning out for Langford AFC in a bottom of the league clash with Wotton Rovers. Simon Graham, Wotton Rovers manager, said it was "chuffed" but their right winger was a "little bit nervous" about marking an "ex-England superstar". "We've got a young squad and Stuart Pearce's legs aren't as fresh as they used to be so we'll run some rings around him," he said. Pearce, who won 78 England caps, was part of Sir Bobby Robson's squad that reached the last four of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, and the Terry Venables-led side that was eliminated at the same stage of Euro '96. He retired from playing six years after that, having enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Manchester City, West Ham, Coventry and non-league Wealdstone, as well as captaining Forest under the management of Brian Clough.	England football legend Stuart Pearce is set to finally make his debut for a team dubbed "the worst in the UK".
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has pledged â‚¬50m (Â£42m) in funds for rebuilding. At least 268 people are now known to have died and 400 were injured. Teams have continued to search the rubble of toppled buildings for a second night. However, hundreds of aftershocks have hampered the efforts of the 5,000 rescuers. Another magnitude-4.7 tremor struck early on Friday. In addition to the funds, Mr Renzi cancelled taxes for residents and announced a new initiative, "Italian Homes", to tackle criticism over shoddy construction. But he also said that it was "absurd" to think that Italy could build completely quake-proof buildings. It follows criticism in the Italian press over building standards in high-risk areas. Some of the buildings that collapsed had recently been renovated. Historic towns do not have to conform to anti-quake building regulations, which are also often not applied when new buildings are put up. The 6.2-magnitude quake hit in the early hours of Wednesday, 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome in mountainous central Italy. The worst affected towns - Amatrice, Arquata, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto - are usually sparsely populated but have been swelled by tourists visiting for summer, making estimates for the precise number missing difficult. More than 200 people died in Amatrice alone. At least three Britons died in the quake, a local official in Amatrice told the BBC. The Romanian government said 11 of its citizens were missing. Bodies are still being found in the town, including one discovered in the rubble of the Hotel Roma in the city late on Thursday. An official with the fire department, Lorenzo Botti, admitted they were facing a race against time. "The chances of finding people alive in these conditions, in this type of setting, well, it's challenging," he said. But other rescuers said there was still hope, noting that one survivor was pulled from ruins in L'Aquila in 2009 three days after an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. Search teams have asked locals to disable their wi-fi passwords to help rescue workers communicate more effectively. Police have also arrested a man for attempting to break into and loot an empty home in the town, Ansa reported.	Italy has declared a state of emergency in the regions worst hit by Wednesday's earthquake as hopes of finding more survivors fade.
Defender Fabio Da Silva is closing in on a Premier League return with promoted Middlesbrough. He could be followed out of the exit door if acceptable bids are made. "We don't want to lose anyone in the group, but [at] any club apart from the top ones, every player has their price and you have buy-out clauses," he said. "In terms of players going, the Fabio one has been well-documented but nothing has changed on that, it is an ongoing process. "Obviously there are a few players at the club we are willing to listen to offers for and that won't change between now and the end of the window. "We talk about it as a club, as a head coach I get a very big say in that, but like any club, players have their prices and if clubs reach that price and turn the players' head, it is very difficult. "If players have high offers, obviously you listen to those offers." Trollope, who has left the Welsh coaching set-up to focus on his managerial career, says he has spoken with defender Jazz Richards. Richards, formerly a Swansea player, was booed by Cardiff supporters in their season opener at Birmingham for his apparent reluctance to 'do the Ayattolah' - a cult Cardiff celebration which involved tapping your head with both hands. Cardiff even went to the lengths of releasing footage that showed Richards did do the celebration at St Andrews. Trollope told BBC Radio Wales Sport that he does expect Richards to "respect the club's traditions." "I spoke to Jazz, he is aware of the club's traditions and obligations and it is something that happened during the game that I was not aware of," Trollope explained. "We have got evidence and he assures us that he did it, which I think some of the supporters saw. "But moving forward I don't think it will be a problem. "He performed at a good level for us on Saturday, we were pleased with his contribution, but we don't need these things going on around it. "He's aware of our expectations. He was focused on the game and he did it, that's the main thing and it is a learning curve for him for the next games as to what he should be doing." Cardiff travel to Trollope's former club Bristol Rovers tomorrow night for a clash in the first round of the EFL Cup.	Head coach Paul Trollope says every player at Cardiff City "has their price," before the transfer window closes.
The Ports occupy bottom spot and they are 11 points adrift of Carrick Rangers with four games left. "We look forward to it and we'll have a good chance against Ballinamallard," said Ports boss Niall Currie. Ballinamallard are 11 points clear of Rangers, who sit in the relegation play-off place, so they will retain their Premiership status with a win. Carrick are not in action until Saturday, when they take on Ards, but their destiny may already have been decided by events at Shamrock Park. Portadown came from behind to beat Carrick 2-1 last weekend and Currie is hoping for a repeat display. "We've a lot of kids playing at the minute and if they play like they did against Carrick then we have every confidence for this game," he added. Media playback is not supported on this device "All our remaining matches are ones we can really challenge for." Ballinamallard will be without the suspended Ryan McConnell but Stuart Hutchinson is set to return. "It will be a massive challenge as they are fighting for their lives - it's going be a tough game," said Mallards manager Gavin Dykes.	Anything less than victory against the Mallards will see Portadown relegated from the Irish Premiership.
But new research from Imperial College London suggests the gender gap between men and women's life expectancies is narrowing. It predicts in 2030 men in England and Wales can expect to live on average to 85.7 years - just two years fewer than women. In 1981 on the other hand, men were likely to die six years before women on average. But why does this gender gap exist and will it ever close? In 1909 women tended to outlive men by just 2.5 years, Prof Les Mayhew at Cass Business School says. At this point infections were the most common cause of death and they affected men and women equally in many respects. But most adults were dead by their early fifties - and many lives would have ended much earlier through childhood illness. As living standards improved and antibiotics were developed to help fight off major killers, life expectancy increased. But despite these gains, the gap between men and women began to widen in the second half of the century. Smoking is widely recognised as one of the main reasons behind the gender gap. And quitting is seen by many as the main reason it is now narrowed. Records show men took up tobacco earlier than women and more of them picked up the habit - meaning their epidemic had a greater and long-lasting impact on their life spans. By 1948 estimates suggest 80% of men were using some form of tobacco. Inevitably many died of smoking related ailments such as heart attacks and lung cancer. And this stamped out many of the gains in life expectancy men may otherwise have enjoyed. Women on the other hand took up smoking a generation later on average. But the female habit never reached the same proportions that male smoking did. By the 1960S and 1970s doctors and government officials had started to take the link between tobacco and death more seriously. And gradually smoking rates began to decline. Many of the benefits are being reaped today - and because more men smoked, they now enjoy a greater share in these longevity gains. Prof Sir Richard Peto, from Oxford University says: "About half of all smokers are killed by tobacco if they continue to smoke. "But stopping works amazingly well. "Those who stop before the age of 40 - preferably well before then - avoid more than 90% of the risks." Improvements in prevention and treatment of heart disease have contributed too. And others suggest many men are involved in less dangerous jobs now. For example, a million men were employed in dangerous mining in the 1920s putting them at risk of lung disease. Prof Les Mayhew of Cass Business school argues this is unlikely. In a study published last year he says:  "It would be hard to justify these differences on biological grounds since the gender gap varies so much and is different in each country, and therefore it is more likely to be societal in origin." But others say biological differences probably play a part. Projections indicate when comparing non-smoking men and non-smoking women, life expectancy remains higher in women. No one has pinned down exactly what this biological advantage would be, if it exists at all. But experts suggest it could be partly due to hormones protecting women from heart disease. Whatever is protecting women, their advantage over men has been hugely aggravated by smoking patterns, Prof Peto says. Many theories on the male shortfall in life expectancy are still open to debate and yet to be proven definitively. Some studies suggest females enjoy a longer life partly because their immune systems age more slowly. So in older age they are able to fight off illnesses, while men grow more susceptible to disease. Others argue there is an ancient, evolutionary answer to the gap - seen in other species too. One theory  suggests males' competitive natures- arising from a desire to attract mates - encourages them to  engage in more risky and ultimately more fatal behaviours. Others believe women may be needed for longer, to make sure their offspring are well cared for into the future. Official figures show the gap has been closing gradually. And Office of National Statistics estimates put the gap at  around three years by 2037. Prof Mayhew on the other hand, in work published in 2014, estimates men and women could expect to live as long as each other in 2030. But others call that an implausible claim. Predictions are uncertain - many things could change in the years to come. In the tricky world of modelling the future, there is some consensus on at least one thing. Both men and women are likely to continue living longer and according to some - healthier - lives for many years to come.	It has long been accepted that women outlive men.
In a study of more than 70,000 women, optimists were less likely to get fatal cancer, heart disease, lung conditions and stroke in their retirement years. Although some of the association is explained by healthier life choices and behaviours, experts believe a positive mental attitude is powerful in itself. And even if you lack a natural sunny disposition, optimism can be learned. Encouraging people to imagine a bright future could be a good medicine to boost public health, say the authors of the study in the American Journal of Epidemiology. The researchers looked at health data collected from a large US study of working and retired female nurses. The participants had been asked to rate how optimistic they perceived themselves to be on a scale of zero to 24. The healthy women, who ranged in age from 58 to 83, were monitored over the next eight years and any disease-related deaths were recorded. There were 4,566 deaths overall. Higher optimism was linked with lower death risk, even after controlling for other factors such as whether the woman was married, came from a richer or poorer family background, or had a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or depression. A significantly lowered risk was seen for deaths from a number of causes, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease and infection over the course of the study period. The researchers believe optimism may have a biological effect on the body as well as a psychological one, although they didn't look at this. Other studies have linked a positive outlook to lower inflammation, for example, and better heart health. Join the conversation - find us on Facebook. Investigator Dr Eric Kim, from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, said there were several strategies people might want to try for an optimism boost: Or you could try a course of mindfulness or some sessions of talking therapy. He said: "Twin studies suggest up to 25% of optimism might be genetic or inherited which would mean up to 75% could be modifiable."	Women who look on the bright side of life cut their risk of many deadly diseases, according to researchers.
Broken swords and spearheads were found by archaeologists on the RSPB Scotland nature reserve. Twelve pieces excavated from several different weapons have been handed over to Kilmartin Museum in Argyll. RSPB Scotland reserves archaeologist Jill Harden said they had probably been deliberately broken and thrown into a loch as part of a religious ceremony. "This is the first discovery of this size from Argyll for many years," she said. "The items were recovered from what had once been a freshwater loch - it seems that they had been purposely broken and cast into the waters as part of a ceremony, most likely as offerings or gifts to the gods or goddesses of the time. "It is recorded that bronze swords were found on Coll in the 19th Century during drainage works, but their whereabouts today are unknown." The archaeological investigation was directed by the Treasure Trove Unit, National Museums Scotland and RSPB Scotland. Trevor Cowie, from National Museums Scotland's department of Scottish history and archaeology, said: "While a fair number of objects from this period have been discovered in the west of Scotland in the past, we generally know very little about the precise places where they were found. "Archaeological techniques have developed dramatically since those 19th Century discoveries were made, so we have a great opportunity here to resolve many unanswered questions about life on Coll some 3,000 years ago." The weapons can be viewed at the the Isle of Coll's An Cridhe community centre on Thursday and Friday.	Bronze weapons believed to date back about 3,000 years have been discovered on the Isle of Coll.

One Direction, an English-Irish boy band, is particularly popular. For most of November, the top hashtags trending in Russia either directly referenced One Direction or were promoted by the band's fans. One example is "#1DRU" (which stands for "One Direction Russia") and another is "#PurposeFollowsMITAM" (which references recent albums by Justin Bieber and One Direction). On most other days, the top-trending hashtags in Russia were also associated with Western pop culture, or its fans. Particularly active were followers of the bands My Chemical Romance and 5 Seconds of Summer, and TV or film series such as The Hunger Games, Teen Wolf and Shameless. There was only one day in November when the top hashtag had anything to do with the day's news in Russia. On 24 November, Turkey shot down a Russian bomber on the border with Syria, and "#plane" was the top trending hashtag. The starting point is usually a single tweet. "Wow, I only need 33 more followers, let's trend #PerfectFollowsHistory," says a One Direction fan, mixing English words with Russian slang, and referring to an album and a song authored by the band. The hashtag was trending within three hours, being tweeted more than 40 times a minute. The main point of such "Twitter storms" is to get more followers. This tactic seems to work well, as some Russian One Direction fans boast tens of thousands of followers. User @vodkaforharry, for example, has 82,300. The tweets are worlds away from the mood music in Russia's mainstream media, which echoes the Kremlin's belligerent rhetoric towards the West. Russian pop fans, it would appear, do not see Twitter as a place to discuss the Ukrainian or Syrian conflicts. Twitter is by no means representative of the whole of Russia. But the top-trending hashtags show that despite the political tensions, Western pop culture still casts a spell on many young and tech-savvy Russians. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.	Young Russians are using Twitter en masse to share their reverence for Western pop bands and TV series - in sharp contrast to Russia's mainstream state-controlled media.
Matt Groening told Smithsonian magazine  he based the town on Springfield, Oregon, but since it is such a common US place name he knew many would think it was their own Springfield. The Springfield question is one of the best-kept secrets in TV history. The Simpsons is the longest-running animation on US TV, on air since 1989. Characters in the show have often joked about hiding Springfield's real location. "In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought: 'This will be cool, everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do," Mr Groening said. There are thought to be at least 34 towns or cities called Springfield in the US. Mr Groening also said he was inspired by the TV show Father Knows Best, which was set in a place called Springfield. But the Springfield in Oregon is just 100 miles (160km) south of Portland, the city where Mr Groening grew up. The Simpsons has sometimes given false answers to the question of Springfield's true location, leaving open the possibility that Mr Groening's latest comments are a continuation of the joke. "Whenever people say it's Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go: 'Yup, that's right,'" Mr Groening said. In one episode, Marge and Homer Simpson's precocious daughter Lisa points to Springfield on a map, but the audience's view is obscured by Bart Simpson's head. It appears that the town of Springfield, Oregon, has known of its connection to the sitcom since 2007, when Mr Groening visited before the release of The Simpsons Movie. "Oh, okay, we knew that," a community relations manager told the Associated Press when she heard about Mr Groening's latest comments.	The creator of the iconic cartoon sitcom The Simpsons has finally revealed the inspiration behind the show's fictional town of Springfield.
The Seagulls remain one point ahead of second-placed Newcastle. Tommy Smith's angled shot put the hosts in front before Tomer Hemed rounded the goalkeeper to equalise. Nahki Wells fired into the top corner and Elias Kachunga nodded in to make it 3-1 before half-time, and Lewis Dunk's red card added to Brighton's misery. Centre-back Dunk was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half for a lunging challenge on Izzy Brown, having been booked in the first period for a foul on the same player. The Terriers' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Leeds, who they play at home on Sunday. Brighton, knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln five days earlier, were uncharacteristically poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months. The outstanding Rajiv van La Parra had already hit the post before full-back Smith's attempted cross landed back at his feet, and his subsequent shot flew in at the near post. Hemed pounced on a poor back header from Huddersfield's Aaron Mooy to level, but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes. Wells' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in English football, and it was the former Bradford forward's shot which goalkeeper David Stockdale palmed into the air for Kachunga to head in Huddersfield's third from close range. After Dunk's dismissal, the fifth of his career, there was still time for Australian midfielder Mooy to strike the upright from long range and Stockdale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute Kasey Palmer. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: "It was a good one, maybe one of the best this season. We scored three goals and had chances for more, and conceded a sloppy goal which was easy to avoid, but it was very good. "We are fresh and still very hungry and greedy, even when we are humble and we know we're playing against the best team in the division. "We gave ourselves no limits, we try our best and today our best was very good." Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: "Every now and again you get a real bad one, and that was a real bad one. "We were nowhere near the levels you need to play any game in this division, never mind one as good as Huddersfield, and on their own ground too. "If we put in another performance like this at Brentford on Sunday, we will lose again. We need to be far better. "Lewis Dunk has played the ball but he was already on a yellow and he's given the referee a decision to make. It's another one for him and something he has to learn from. We are going to miss him. It's a blow." Match ends, Huddersfield Town 3, Brighton and Hove Albion 1. Second Half ends, Huddersfield Town 3, Brighton and Hove Albion 1. Attempt saved.

The cockpit voice recorder from the accident off Shetland in 2013, in which four people died, was recovered by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A judge ruled it was in the public interest and the interests of justice to make it available. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said it had lodged an appeal. The  union's general secretary, Jim McAuslan, said: "The 2013 Supa Puma accident was tragic, and it is vital the AAIB gets to the root cause and has access to whatever data it needs. "However, providing the data to the prosecutor and the police in parallel to the AAIB's investigation cuts across everything pilots and the broader flight safety community stand for. "We cannot stand by while the court allows that to happen without pursuing other legal avenues to highlight our concerns and question whether it is the correct approach." Prosecutors have been trying to establish whether anybody could be held criminally responsible for the crash. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has the right to initial access to the cockpit voice recorder but it routinely chooses not to hand over the material to other bodies - in this case the Crown prosecutors. The BBC Scotland news website revealed last year an order was being sought by Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC at the Court of Session to access the data. It was a rare legal move. Lord Jones said he was satisfied that disclosing the data would have no adverse impact on current or future crash investigations - but that it could only be disclosed to the Crown Office and Police Scotland. A total of 18 people were on board when the Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh. Helicopter passengers Sarah Darnley from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, from Winchester, lost their lives.	A ruling that investigators should hand over the black box from a North Sea helicopter crash to Scotland's top law officer is being challenged.
He is the first American Secretary of State to visit the city. In a meeting with Somalia's president under tight security at the airport, he said: "Next time I come, we have to be able to just walk downtown". The US backs the Somali government in its fight against Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which still controls many rural parts of southern Somalia. African news as it happens: 5 May 2015 The meeting with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and civil leaders was held at Mogadishu airport, as Mr Kerry isn't leaving its heavily fortified perimeters. Mr Kerry said: "I visited Somalia today because your country is turning around". The more recent changes he pointed out were Somali forces pushing al-Shabab out of big towns and a "determined international effort" to put virtually all of Somalia's pirates out of business. BBC Somalia analyst Mary Harper says the US plays a crucial if controversial role in Somalia, supporting the weak central government in its fight against al-Shabab. Al-Shabab leaders have been killed in US drone strikes. Our correspondent points out that America is careful to take a less visible role than it did in the 1990s, when the bodies of US servicemen were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.	The US Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, on an unannounced visit.
Tareck el-Aissami was described by the US treasury as a drug "kingpin" who worked with traffickers in Mexico and Colombia to ship drugs to America. Hitting back, he accused the US of "defamatory aggression". Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro demanded a public apology from the US for sanctioning his new deputy. The sanctions freeze Mr Aissami's assets in the US and bar him from entering the country. He is seen as a powerful figure within the governing party and has been entrusted by Mr Maduro with key powers normally held by the president, such as determining ministerial budgets and expropriating private companies. The US treasury accuses him of being in the pay of convicted Venezuelan drug lord Walid Makled for protecting drug shipments. "They'll never be able to defeat our unbreakable resolution to be free forever," Mr Aissami said. Sanctions were also imposed on wealthy Venezuelan businessman Samark Lopez, described as Mr Aissami's "primary frontman". Mr Lopez released a statement saying he had not trafficked drugs. Vice-President Aissami is the highest-ranking Venezuelan official ever to be sanctioned by the US, which has not exchanged ambassadors with the country since 2010. US counter-narcotics experts have long said that large amounts of cocaine transit from Colombia through Venezuela on to Europe and the US.	The vice-president of Venezuela has accused the US of "imperialist aggression" after it slapped sanctions on him for allegedly trafficking drugs.
Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of heavy construction equipment. The firm has operations in Larne, Newtownabbey and west Belfast. Caterpillar's Northern Ireland business employs 1,800 people and mainly makes diesel generators. The firm has been hit by a global downturn in mining and oil exploration which has reduced demand for its products. It is understood that the company may announce cuts across its global operations beyond Northern Ireland. It has already axed thousands of jobs worldwide since last year as part of a major restructuring programme. Since 2011 it has shed more than 1,000 posts in Northern Ireland and moved some work to factories in China. It is understood night-shifts have been cancelled, with staff told to expect official news on Thursday. Caterpillar refused to comment on any jobs announcement yesterday. But a spokesman added:  "Caterpillar is committed to communicating regularly and directly with our employees about the business environment and any resulting changes". Sinn FÃ©in MP for West Belfast Paul Maskey said yesterday: "Uncertainty over the future of Caterpillar's operations in the north will be no doubt distressing for workers and their families." "It is vitally important that management keep all employees up to date with the latest information as soon as possible," he added. The American company bought FG Wilson in 1999. There have been significant manufacturing job losses in Northern Ireland over the past year, including Michelin, JTI Gallahers and Bombardier.	Workers in Northern Ireland factories operated by US firm Caterpillar will be given details of job cuts later.
At the start of each month Elena, a 40-year-old Muscovite, spreads all the family cash on the table and starts dividing it into small piles. "When I do this I shake, I feel nauseous," she says. "This goes to one bank, that to another, then the third one… There's one more bank, but we don't have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food. I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders." Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about £10,800; $17,000) to those four banks. After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (£107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job. Millions of those in debt live like Elena. According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages. By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months. The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (£10.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks. For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones. It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions. "We were a bit stupid," Elena says. "They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself." During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about. Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles. Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because "the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says. Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October. Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead. Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution. A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: "I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!" Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and "this year it's probably going to be around 16%". He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow. Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents. His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. "How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was." Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance. And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling. "There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma. "Isn't there a law against this?" asks his father, equally helplessly. "How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?" After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.	Millions of Russians took out loans during the economic boom years, but now they face crippling debts and the law is not on their side, the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev reports.
Rachel Fee, 31, and her partner Nyomi Fee, 28, are accused of murdering the two-year-old in March 2014 at a house near Glenrothes, Fife, and ill-treating two other boys. The two women deny all the charges against them. Jurors immediately asked for a break after watching the 12-minute film. The video was shown to the jury at the High Court in Livingston. It showed Liam lying on the floor of his bedroom in his pyjamas, covered in a duvet. The video was taken by detectives in the early hours of 23 March 2014. The court had previously heard paramedics arrived at the house just after 20:00 the previous evening. The video showed each room of the house where the toddler lived with Rachel and Nyomi Fee. There was a cot in the room, alongside a buggy and pictures of Liam on the wall. Later, Police Constable Sam Girdwood, 24, told the trial he and his partner were called to the house after receiving a report a baby was in cardiac arrest and may have been strangled by a young boy. Pc Girdwood said he arrived and Rachel Fee was standing with the boy who she and Nyomi are accused of falsely blaming for Liam's death. He said: "She had a hold of the young boy and told him to tell me what had happened. He mumbled something that sounded like 'I strangled him'." The officer said he took the boy into a separate room from the women where he repeated the claim, and brought it up later at Glenrothes police station. He said: "He wanted to tell me what happened. He put his hand up in the air to say he had done this to (Liam). He went on to say something along the lines of (Liam) was getting more attention than him." Both accused, who are originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, also wept as the video was played to the jury. The couple are accused of murdering Liam and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by blaming the killing on a young boy. They are also charged with a catalogue of allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children, one of whom they blame for killing Liam, while in their care over a two-year period. They deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.	Members of the jury in the Liam Fee murder trial wept as they were shown a police video of the toddler's body hours after he was found dead.
The Wikileaks co-founder sought asylum at London's Ecuadorean embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at £12m ($18.8m; €16.8m), was "unacceptable". Earlier, Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange, who had denied the claims. Mr Assange still faces the more serious accusation of rape, which he also denies. The British Ambassador in Quito, Ecuador's capital, is to make the formal protest to the Ecuadorean government on Thursday. "Ecuador must recognise that its decision to harbour Mr Assange more than three years ago has prevented the proper course of justice... It is completely unacceptable that the British taxpayer has had to foot the bill for this abuse of diplomatic relations," said Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire. Mr Swire said the UK "continues to have a legal obligation" to extradite Mr Assange over the rape allegation. "I have instructed our ambassador in Quito to reiterate to Ecuador that the continuing failure... to bring this situation to an end, is being seen as a growing stain on the country's reputation," he added. Full timeline Julian Assange profile Mr Assange sought asylum three years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden, fearing he would then be sent to the US and put on trial for releasing secret American documents. The UK has paid for policing around the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, for the past three years. The formal protest comes after Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into an allegation of sexual molestation and an accusation of unlawful coercion against Mr Assange because they ran out of time to question him. An additional alleged incident of sexual molestation will be "time barred" - that is, time will run out to question Mr Assange - on 18 August. The Swedish statement also said an allegation of rape was due to expire on 17 August 2020, but that investigation would continue. The alleged events took place in August 2010. Mr Assange said he was "extremely disappointed", adding the Swedish prosecutor had avoided hearing his side of the story. Under Swedish law, charges cannot be laid without interviewing the suspect. "There was no need for any of this. I am an innocent man. I haven't even been charged," said Mr Assange. "From the beginning I offered simple solutions. Come to the embassy to take my statement or promise not to send me to the United States. This Swedish official refused both. She even refused a written statement." However, Sweden's director of public prosecution said a request to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy had been submitted but permission was yet to be granted. Marianne Nye said she still hoped to arrange an interview as there were "ongoing negotiations" between Sweden and Ecuador. One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Helena Kennedy, said: "Julian Assange has spent more time incarcerated in the small rooms of the embassy, with no access to fresh air or exercise and contrary to international law, than he could ever spend in a Swedish prison on these allegations." Mr Assange's mother Christine said: "I have privately shed many tears for many years - the terrible injustice of it all." Wikileaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have caused intense embarrassment for the US and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations.	The UK is to make a formal protest to the government of Ecuador over the country's decision to "harbour" Julian Assange, the Foreign Office has said.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 32-year-old's first World Series win since 2012 ended the 13-event winning streak of Gwen Jorgensen. The Welsh triathlete also beat British rival Jodie Stimpson. "Helen has put a very strong case forward," said Stanford, who has already qualified for Rio along with Vicky Holland. With an official announcement due in June, two-time world champion Jenkins and England's Commonwealth champion Stimpson are competing to be part of Britain's female triathlon contingent in Rio this summer. "Personally, I can't see how they can't pick Helen," said Jenkins' Welsh compatriot Stanford. "British Triathlon were saying that you had to display potential to medal for Rio and she's absolutely done that. "She's gone out there and won the race and not only that she's beaten Gwen Jorgensen, who is the hot favourite to win gold in Rio, so if you beat her you've shown you have potential to medal so I'd be very surprised if she's not selected." Stimpson made a strong start to the season, winning the opening World Series event in Abu Dhabi and the sprint distance World Cup in Australia. But she trailed in 12th, more than three minutes behind the winner, at the Gold Coast. "Jodie had a fantastic start to the season," added Stanford, the 2013 world champion. "But sadly she didn't quite have the race she wanted at the Gold Coast which was the actual selection race. "That was the day they had to really perform and show what they were capable of doing, but she presented a strong case earlier in the year and you never know what the selectors are thinking and which way they will go." After winning the race in Australia, Jenkins said: "The team is not announced yet but I think I have probably done enough today. "Our team is so strong and it is so unfair that Jodie might not be going to the Games."	Non Stanford will be surprised if Helen Jenkins is not in the British triathlon team for the Olympics after her victory in the Gold Coast World Series event.
Arsenal dominated with Gervinho failing to hit the target from a good position and Jake Kean making several key saves. Tomas Rosicky hit the bar after the break but the Championship side scored when Kazim-Richards followed in on Martin Olsson's shot. Theo Walcott was denied late in the game as Arsenal's hopes of ending their eight-year trophy drought were dented. "Blackburn just kept believing they could get something out of this game. "The amount of pressure Arsenal were putting on them at the end was relentless. Grant Hanley and Scott Dann will not have played a better game this season, or even in their entire careers. "An outstanding performance from Blackburn." The Gunners could not find a way through Blackburn's defence as Michael Appleton's team defended for their lives at the end of the game. Mikel Arteta was another Arsenal player who shot off-target. It means Arsene Wenger's team have only the Champions League left if they are to win silverware this season, having already been knocked out of the Capital One Cup by League Two side Bradford in December. Appleton has already lost in the FA Cup this season, when in charge of Portsmouth, and was manager at Blackpool in the third round when they drew with Fulham before the 37-year-old left the club. But he has overseen a transformation at Ewood Park during his short time at Rovers, who were relegated from the Premier League last season. This victory extended his side's unbeaten run to six games after suffering defeat by Charlton in his first match in charge on 19 January. Blackburn are yet to concede in the FA Cup this season and have now reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2007 and sit six points off the play-off places in the Championship. Having made seven changes to the side which defeated Sunderland 1-0 last weekend, it was clear Wenger had one eye on Tuesday's Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. But the Frenchman may live to regret waiting until 70 minutes had passed before bringing on substitutes Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla as his side chased the game at 0-0. Gervinho returned from an impressive Africa Cup of Nations tournament with the Ivory Coast to start his first Arsenal game since that penalty shoot-out loss to Bradford on 11 December. Unfortunately, his biggest contribution in a first half dominated by the Gunners was to drag his shot wide when he was put through by Rosicky after 41 minutes. For all their possession in an opening period where Arsenal had 12 corners, Wenger's team did not forge many openings. And when they did, the impressive Blackburn goalkeeper Kean saved headers from Abou Diaby and Thomas Vermaelen, who returned to the side after injury. Kean also stopped Olivier Giroud's effort after the break with Jason Lowe's header Blackburn's best effort up until the hour mark. Rovers brought on former Gunner David Bentley to try and make an impression, but it seemed to rouse the home supporters before Rosicky smacked a long-range shot against the bar. That was his last meaningful action as Wenger brought on his trio of substitutes to try and avoid a replay in an already-congested month. But Blackburn went ahead two minutes later. Wojciech Szczesny could only palm Olsson's angled shot away and Kazim-Richards's scuffed rebound went in off the post. It was a stunning blow by the Rovers striker, a boyhood Arsenal fan. Walcott injected some much needed urgency into the Gunners' play and his header from Wilshere's cross could not breach the Blackburn rearguard as Appleton's side held on for a famous victory. Blackburn manager Michael Appleton: "Colin Kazim-Richards has been fantastic for the last five games and has played in a couple of different roles. "I am delighted he got the reward for all of his work, it was not his greatest of strikes, but I think he was just trying not to welly it into Row Z and got the bit of luck he deserved. "I had a brief stint at Blackpool when I ended up with a 1-1 draw at Fulham in the last round, then was lucky enough to win at Derby, but this is the icing at the top of the cake."

The 33-year-old, leading after Friday's dressage, delivered a fault-free cross-country round on his mount La Biosthetique. Jung won the Burghley and Kentucky titles and is hoping to seal the Rolex Grand Slam to earn the bonus. Great Britain's challenge faltered, with Emily King eliminated. She was second overnight but fell riding Brookleigh before Sunday's showjumping finale. The 20-year-old shone in the dressage to raise hopes of becoming the youngest Badminton winner since 1973. Instead it is Jung who will be centre stage as he attempts to become just the second winner of the Grand Slam, emulating Pippa Funnell in 2003. "It's a long night, a big day, everything can happen," said Jung, an individual and team gold medallist at London 2012. "For me, this is the best horse in the world. It is a wonderful feeling to ride such a good horse." Jung remains on 34.4 penalty points, nine better off than compatriot Andreas Ostholt aboard So Is Et and 10.2 points ahead of Britain's Gemma Tattersall, who rides Arctic Soul, in third. The cross-country challenge Jung navigated all 33 obstacles over the 6,500m course with precision and finished well inside the optimal time - 11 minutes 58 seconds - at which competitors begin to incur time penalties. It means he can afford to see two poles fall in Sunday's showjumping finale, assuming his closest rivals deliver blemish-free rounds. "That horse is really amazing," added Jung. "He always listens to me and trusts in me." In all, 27 of 75 horses failed to complete the course, set against the picturesque backdrop of Badminton House. Organisers believe last year's cross-country attendance of 95,000 was comfortably bettered, with more than 100,000 people lining the track. King's fall at the penultimate obstacle drew howls of concern from those watching and she was visibly upset. The daughter of six-time Olympian Mary King is one of a number of Britons looking to position themselves for a place at the Rio Olympics. Tattersall's third place overnight gives her a fine chance of improving on her best finish at Badminton - 16th last year. Team GB hopefuls must hit qualifying standards on the horse they wish to take to the Games by 19 June, with a selection announcement expected in July. Former world champion Zara Tindall and her mount High Kingdom have work to do, as they sit 24th in the field, but Oliver Townend and Izzy Taylor are eighth and ninth on Armada and Allercombe Ellie respectively.	Germany's Michael Jung closed in on a £240,000 bonus prize as he secured a dominant lead to take into the final day of Badminton Horse Trials.
Petro Poroshenko said 80% of Ukraine's troops left on Wednesday morning after several days of fierce fighting. Russia said Ukrainian forces had tried to fight their way out of the town after being encircled but Mr Poroshenko insisted they were never surrounded. The rebel advance on Debaltseve, which came in spite of the recent ceasefire agreement, has been widely condemned. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the rebels' offensive had put the wider peace agreement at risk and urged Russia to "use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire". He also called on Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, saying Russian troops, artillery and air defence units were still active in the country. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the rebels' actions in Debaltseve had not violated the ceasefire because it was a rebel-held city when the peace agreement was signed last week. He urged rebels to provide troops who surrendered with food and clothes and said he hoped the situation in the city would "not be used to find a pretext to actually undermine [the agreement]". Eyewitnesses saw dozens of tanks and columns of weary Ukrainian troops retreating from Debaltseve on Wednesday. Russia's state-controlled Channel One TV showed footage of what it said were rebels raising their flag on top of a high-rise building in the town. Later rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin was quoted in Russian media as saying Debaltseve was fully under the control of separatists, although there were still "disparate groups of the enemy" in the southern part of town. One rebel commander in the city told the BBC that conditions were dire, with no electricity and a shortage of food and water. He said rebels were sharing their rations with the remaining civilians. President Poroshenko said in a statement: "Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organised manner." He called for "a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements, the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry". Mr Poroshenko visited the soldiers who had left Debaltseve in the town of Artemivsk on Wednesday. Earlier, he said it would be an honour to shake hands with "Ukrainian heroes". A senior Ukrainian military official said 22 Ukrainian soldiers had died in Debaltseve over the past three days. Earlier, an official at a morgue in Artemivsk said the bodies of 25 Ukrainian soldiers had been brought to the facility from Debaltseve but this has not been confirmed. Rebels have claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in clashes around the city, but Mr Poroshenko denied this. The government in Kiev admitted that that some soldiers were taken prisoner in Debaltseve, but gave no details on how many were seized. All Wednesday, the road out of Debaltseve into government-held territory thundered to the sound of retreating armour - tanks and troop carriers full of exhausted, sometimes defiant soldiers. In a bus by the side of the road, I found one Yuri slumped on his seat, across the aisle from a sleeping colleague. He said the situation had become increasingly dire and individual units had taken their own decisions to leave. They were running out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded, he told me. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for deceiving everyone about the ceasefire. We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up. In nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve. President Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. The withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender. Mr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government. Spokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made. International observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve. The city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Most of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn. The UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher. Fighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. Ukraine's pro-Western government says Russia is supporting the separatists with troops and weapons, but the Kremlin has consistently denied this. Minsk agreement: Key points	The Ukrainian president says his forces are making an "organised" withdrawal from the embattled town of Debaltseve.
Evans gave the Bantams the lead with style early on as he curled home from 20 yards into the bottom corner. The Shripmers fought back and Ryan Leonard forced Bradford goalkeeper Ben Williams into a fine save with a fierce effort from long-range. The hosts almost restored parity when Tyrone Barnett volleyed against the crossbar but Bradford held on.	Bradford City made sure of a League One play-off spot as they beat Southend United thanks to Lee Evans' early goal.
For the past 31 years, the European Union has had quotas, or limits, on how much milk farmers can produce. The rules were put in place so farmers wouldn't make too much but would also get a fair price. But now those quotas have been lifted so with no limits farmers are being allowed to produce as much milk as they want. Four farmers got in touch with Newsbeat to tell us how they'll be affected by the changes. "We've all known this has been coming for some time. We've been trying to put our businesses in the best possible position - to produce milk as cheaply as possible. "This means keeping as many cows and pushing out as much milk as we can for every worker, as well as producing as much milk as possible from grass - the cheapest feed available on our farm. "It's likely that this will lead to a flood of milk and probably pull down the price even further. "It's not an easy game and it never will be. I suppose, really and truly, the most efficient farms will survive the test of milk quota removal. "It'll be a survival of the fittest." "I'm from a family farm and we've mixed feelings about the end of the quotas as it leaves the dairy industry in an unknown area. "You don't know how the markets are going to evolve with the access to more products from Europe and also allowing farmers within the UK to expand. "Usually in the spring time, that's when the cows get [put] to grass, and you get an increase in milk production. "So if you're lifting the quotas at the same time, you're going to have a lot of milk in the country and not necessarily be getting a very good price for it." "I think pretty much everyone is aware that milk prices aren't great, which means farmers are losing money. "It's heartbreaking when you see people leaving the industry. It sounds silly, but cows become a part of your family and to face the prospect of walking into an empty farmyard is something none of us want. "The removing of quotas is potentially a great opportunity for famers to move into the global market. It's all down to how you see it, do you view it an opportunity? Or do you see it as a time to quit? Some people see it that way, but I hope that doesn't put young farmers off." "The milk price at the minute is devastating small farmers like myself, simply because you physically can't afford to carry on really. "It's going to get to the point where there's only going to be these so-called super farms left, with 1,000-2,000 cows or in some cases even more. "My parents are just barely scraping by to keep the household going. "Dairy farming's hard - you're doing 12-13 hours days every day. It's not a job, it's a way of life and we love it. "It's a valuable part of the English countryside and it just seems to be fading away. "It just seems sad that it might come to the point where we might have to give it up."

Forster, who rejoined the club in July after 22 games on dual registration at Haven earlier in his career, replaces sacked James Coyle. He began his career at Saints, winning the academy Grand Final there, but was limited to five senior appearances. "This appointment will lift everybody," general manager Amanda Hewer said. The ex-Salford forward takes charge after a season which saw Haven relegated from the Championship, despite winning three of the final five games in the Super 8s.

Gloucester have played away from their Meadow Park home since a flood in 2007. In September, planning permission was approved to permit initial work on building a new ground for Gloucester. The University of Gloucestershire-based All Golds, who are in the third tier of rugby league, currently play in Cheltenham but want a permanent home. All Golds president Lionel Hurst told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "We have met with those who own the club. "We can see that it makes considerable sense. We will need to have more meetings. "We are a long way from getting over the line on this, but watch this space. We are constantly seeking our own permanent base for the club. "Rugby league and football are very good friends throughout the land. It would be a very significant partnership if it happened."	National League North side Gloucester City are in talks with rugby league team Gloucestershire All Golds about a potential groundshare.
The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury. However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected. Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later. He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side. There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby. Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.	England number eight Billy Vunipola is set for a shock early return to action for his club Saracens against Newcastle on Sunday, boosting his hopes of a 2017 Six Nations call-up.
Mike Welch, chief executive of Blackcircles.com, can expect to gain a third of that sale price, while staying with the company. He started selling tyres aged 16 before joining Kwik-Fit. Aged 21, he set up Black Circles, basing it in Peebles, where it employs 50 people. Welch, now aged 36, built it up to annual sales in 2013 of £28m, with annual growth of around 20% per year since 2008.  The first three months of this year have seen revenue rise by 34% on the same period last year. The company developed a "click and fit" business model. Customers choose their tyres online, they are then delivered directly from manufacturers to one of 1,350 independent garages, where the customer then books in a tyre-fitting session. According to the chief executive, prices undercut conventional sales by 20%-to-40%. In March, the company announced that it was looking at ways to extend its growth, including a float on a stock exchange, private equity investment, or a sale. It recruited former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy onto the board, to use his expertise in retail. There is also a trial of a Blackcircles fitting service at some Tesco superstores. The Michelin deal opens up expertise and a much wider distribution network, without limiting Blackcircles.com to the parent company's brand products. Michelin already owns the conventional tyre distributor ATS Euromaster, and the French firm hopes there will be synergies between the two distributors, although Blackcircles.com will continue to operate independently within the Michelin group. "I'm delighted to have found in Michelin a partner who shares our passion for customer service, innovation and technology," said Mr Welch. "The strength of the Michelin Group will allow us to underpin the multi-brand offering that we deploy in each garage, on every street corner. "I am convinced that our teams, our customers, our garages and our suppliers will rapidly start to see the benefits of this partnership." Jean-Dominique Senard, chief executive of the Michelin Group, commented: "Our strategy illustrates our ambition: to be ever more innovative, efficient and proactive for our customers by offering them products and services suited to individual needs, and by simplifying the entire purchase process, from choosing their tyres to having them fitted by professionals." Michelin has 68 production plants in 17 countries, and employs 117,000 people. An interview with Mike Welch can be heard on Business Scotland this weekend - at 06:00 on Saturday and 07:30 on Sunday - on BBC Radio Scotland.	One of Scotland's most successful entrepreneurs has sold his tyre-fitting business for £50m to Michelin.
Goals from Ellen White and Rachel Yankey set up a game against France in Leverkusen on Saturday. "We had a game plan, the girls implemented it, we've topped the group and it can only increase our confidence," Powell told BBC Sport. "We were very, very good and I'm so proud of how well the girls played." England needed to avoid defeat against Japan to be sure of reaching the last eight. They got off to the perfect start when White's lob put them ahead after 15 minutes, with Yankey's clever finish in the second half wrapping up the points. "The ambition was to get out of the group," added Powell. "We're still in the competition, we're not going home and that is brilliant for England. "We made some changes to the team and they worked out, but we always knew it was going to be a squad game. Our opponents from now on doesn't matter. "Sophie Bradley was enormous, Jess Clarke did a job in the first half, we changed a few things and the girls did really well." White, who impressed throughout the game and could have had a second goal when her acrobatic volley was tipped over, admitted scoring was a dream come true. "It's indescribable, the feeling of scoring in a World Cup," said White. "It's the pinnacle of your career to play in this tournament. "I don't know what came over me for that," she said of her near-miss. "I was pretty unlucky but I'm pleased I got on the scoresheet to help the team. "We stuck together as a team and implemented the game plan, which we try and do every game but this one really worked. "We always had somebody kind of filling in, always there pressing the ball and worked really hard for 90 minutes and got the end product. "I think we deserved to win the game in the end. I'm so pleased we got the three points and we topped the group. "We know that if you want to be the best you have to beat the best, so we're happy to take anyone on now we're in the quarters. "They are a great team, Japan, and they put up a real fight and it was a hard game so it was a great win for us and a good team performance."	England women's coach Hope Powell praised her players after they beat Japan 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.
Police said the 14-year-old reported feeling unwell and required hospital treatment. He was later discharged from hospital and is recovering at home. The incident happened in Holywood, County Down, on Saturday. The PSNI said the tablets were "as yet unidentified" but warned of the "potential dangers" they posed. The 17-year-old, has been charged with possessing a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply; possessing a Class B controlled drug with intent to supply; possession of a Class A controlled drug; possession of a Class B controlled drug and supplying a Class A controlled drug.

Adam King struck either side of the break in the 2-0 win over Reading at Liberty Stadium. In March, the Swans' development squad drew with Wolverhampton Wanderers to take the league crown. The cup final win meant the young Swans celebrated 31 wins across all competitions in 2016-17. The youngsters' success came after Swansea's senior team survived in the Premier League after Crystal Palace beat Hull 4-0 on Sunday for the latter to be relegated.	Swansea City Under-23s have won their season's double after adding the Premier League Cup to their Premier League Two title.
Plans for the Ysgol y Berwyn site were originally approved in 2015, and the campus was due to open in 2018. But a petition called for a review of proposals that would see the Church own the buildings. On Tuesday, Gwynedd's cabinet agreed to consult on the school's Church status. The Diocese of St Asaph said it was "disappointed but not surprised" by the decision, and accused the council of making "a complete mess of this project". "The fundamental issue here is that Cyngor Gwynedd (council) has withdrawn its support for this project and as a result has intentionally destabilised the partnership," said the Church in a statement. The original plans would have seen the merging of Ysgol Bro Tegid and Ysgol Beuno Sant, a Church in Wales school, with the secondary Ysgol y Berwyn. But following calls for the site to be designated a community campus - rather than a Church school - the council cabinet has agreed to a new formal consultation. "Unfortunately, following a long period of working in partnership with the Church in Wales, the latest developments have caused great concern amongst governors and members of the local community and poses a significant risk to the success of the school," said the cabinet's education member, Gareth Thomas. "As a result, the cabinet has decided to support the recommendation to hold a formal consultation with governors on the option to abandon the existing proposal." In its statement, the Church said it felt the council "now has a responsibility to the community, children and the diocese to find a way forward that develops community and church education". Church officials said they hoped the council would contact them over the developments "as a matter of urgency".	Gwynedd's council leadership has come under fire from the Church in Wales in a row over the future of plans for a new £10m school campus serving the Bala area.
Robson added a further 56 to his overnight score to reach 231, as Middlesex moved from 317-4 to 452 all out, backed by John Simpson's 52. Warwickshire captain Ian Bell was one of two early visiting wickets to fall. But Jonathan Trott and Varun Chopra saw the Bears to 146-4 by the early close. Chopra made 57, while former England batsman Trott, who batted in old-style helmet which no longer complies with England & Wales Cricket Board regulations, was still there on 62 when play was called off for the day following a break for bad light late in the final session. England's Steven Finn got two wickets on his first competitive appearance since England's third Test against South Africa in January after the calf injury which kept him out of the World T20. He struck with his first ball when he got one to rear and take the shoulder of opener Ian Westwood's bat before removing Sam Hain cheaply. Bell was one of two victims for Tim Murtagh, bowled after only getting half forward to a delivery that may have stayed a touch low. In the morning session, Robson's highest first-class score surpassed his previous best, an unbeaten 215, also against Warwickshire, at Edgbaston in 2013. It was also the highest-ever individual score by a Middlesex batsman against Warwickshire, overtaking a mark set by Bill Edrich, who scored 225 at Edgbaston in 1947. Middlesex bowler Steven Finn told BBC London 94.9: "I probably couldn't have found a better ball first up. I didn't feel I deserved to go at four an over. But that happens when you are on the attack. "I'm where I want to be. I felt in good rhythm. This is a nice starting block. There's no magic answer apart from bowling and getting rhythm that way. "I'm the sort of bowler who likes bowling a lot. If I was only bowling 15 overs in a day in the game, I'd be bowling my overs in the nets." Warwickshire batsman Varun Chopra told BBC WM 95.6: "At the start of the day we could have been looking at 500-550, and batting after tea. To bowl them out by lunch was a good effort. "I felt good. Jonathan Trott looked in fine order too, as he did last week. If he is in a good space, then we are a strong batting line-up. "The ball that got me stayed a little, and Belly too. Finn bowled well. That was a horrible delivery for Ian Westwood to get first up, pace and bounce. He had to play at it."	Sam Robson completed a career-best double century at Lord's to maintain Middlesex's superiority in their opening County Championship game of the season against Warwickshire.
Mark Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, Torfaen, fractured Amelia Jones's skull when he was supposed to be looking after her. He had denied murder but was convicted at Newport Crown Court on Thursday and jailed for life. He was also jailed for four years after admitting perverting the course of justice which will be served concurrently. Mr Justice Wyn Williams said Jones had shown no remorse for his "wicked and despicable" actions. He said: "It may well be that you are never released from prison or if you are, you will be a very old man." The court heard he had "totally destroyed" the life of his daughter, Sarah Jones, and given her surviving children nightmares. A victim impact statement from Ms Jones, said: "It really upsets and saddens me now, looking back, I spent such little time with her. "It seems like she didn't really exist, like she was some kind of dream." The court was told the rest of her children were taken from her for about 18 months, between November 2012 and April 2014. One child in particular was "afraid his grandfather would kill him if he got out of prison", the statement said. "There have been times when I blamed myself for what happened to Amelia, because I was the person who invited him back into my life," Ms Jones added. "As far as I'm concerned he is no longer my father." Amelia died in November 2012 after suffering a "catastrophic" bleed to the brain. During his trial, Jones claimed he fell with Amelia in his arms on one occasion and passed out while holding her on another. But the court heard she had suffered a skull fracture, brain swelling and multiple rib fractures and had been injured at least three different times. The prosecution said the injuries "could not have been accidental" and were all deliberately inflicted by her grandfather, who frequently had sole charge of Amelia. The prosecution said he hurt her because he disliked her father, Ian Skillern.	A man who murdered his five-week-old granddaughter has been jailed for life and will serve a minimum of 25 years.
Their nationalities are not known. The incident occurred early on Wednesday in Helmand province. Soldiers returned fire killing the attackers, a coalition spokesperson said. There have been dozens of "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghan security personnel have targeted their Western allies since 2007. No group has said it carried out the latest attack. Insider attacks - on international and Afghan forces - have became one of the gravest security threats of the later phase of the conflict in Afghanistan, although the rate of such incidents has dropped in recent years. More than 100 foreign soldiers have been killed. Nato has adopted special security measures to offset the threat. The alliance ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December, withdrawing most of its troops apart from a 13,000-strong residual force used for training and counter-terrorism operations. One of the worst insider attacks took place last August when a US general was killed in an attack by an Afghan soldier at a British-run military academy near Kabul. US Major General Harold Greene was the most senior American military officer to die in action overseas since the Vietnam War. Many insider attacks are blamed on Taliban infiltration or arguments between foreign and local soldiers getting out of hand. In some cases such attacks are carried out by an individual - or individuals - acting on their own initiative rather than organised insurgency violence. The Taliban have stepped up their summer offensive despite an acrimonious leadership dispute following the death of their long-time leader Mullah Omar.	Two people in Afghan military uniforms opened fire on a vehicle killing two Nato soldiers at a military base in the south, alliance officials say.
A 'Time To Go, Massimo' poster appeared on an advertising board outside the East Stand on Thursday. The poster was paid for by supporters angry that Cellino has not sold his 75% share in the Championship club. "He has been very positive even through the dark days and bad performances," Raynor told BBC Radio Leeds. "People will do what they want - they'll protest or they won't protest. If we win some football matches there will be less people protesting." Cellino agreed in principle to sell his majority share to supporters' group Leeds Fans United in at the end of last October, but changed his mind a week later. Fans have also been left angry about a 'pie tax,' which saw the club raise the price of Championship tickets in the South Stand by £5. Cellino is currently appealing a ban from the Football League that would prevent him running the club. "(Cellino) has talked about the future. He has been supportive in bringing in the three players we've already brought in," Raynor added. "The biggest frustration for us is that we haven't been winning as many games as we should and that doesn't help matters." Leeds, who are currently 16th in the Championship, have won just one of their last eight league games.	Leeds United's assistant head coach Paul Raynor has said that chairman Massimo Cellino is still positive, despite fan protests at Elland Road.
Dunlop, 27, lapped the course at 132.36mph on his BMW superbike and was only four seconds outside John McGuinness' absolute lap record. The Ballymoney man's speed of 131.34 in the Superstocks improved his own previous best lap of 131.22. Ian Hutchinson was second fastest in the Superbike class with 131.66. Eleven-time TT winner Hutchinson, 36, produced his time on his Tyco BMW Superbike from a standing start. Honda-mounted John McGuinness made up the top three in the blue riband class with 131.12, followed by his Honda team-mate Conor Cummins (129.99) and Yorkshire's Dean Harrison on a Kawasaki (129.97). Fermanagh rider Lee Johnston, riding a Triumph, clocked the fastest Supersport speed of the week at 124.84mph to lie sixth overall in the leaderboard. Bruce Anstey, the quickest Supersport rider to date with 124.508, came off his Superbike machine at Keppel Gate on Thursday evening, but walked away with a suspected minor ankle injury. Michael Rutter moved to the top of the Lightweight Supertwins leaderboard with a lap of 118.054mph, just bettering Ivan Lintin's speed of 118.000mph set on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, Tim Reeves and Patrick Farrance posted a lap of 114.83mph to send them to the top of the sidecar leaderboard ahead of Dave Molyneux and Dan Sayle. The final qualifying session is scheduled to take place on Friday night, with the first race, the Superbikes, due off at 11:00 BST on Saturday.	Michael Dunlop continued his Isle of Man TT practice week dominance as he set the fastest Superbike lap and set an unofficial Superstock lap record.

So far the project has received more than 700 photos and produced 15 3D images of artefacts, mostly from the ransacked Mosul Museum. The archaeologists who established the project hope to widen its scope to include objects lost at other sites, to violence or natural disasters such as the recent Nepal earthquakes.	In an initiative called Project Mosul, cyber-archaeologists and volunteers are re-creating works of art destroyed by IS militants in Iraq.
More than 130 owners have reported overheating problems behind the glove-box area, some of which have resulted in fires. Vauxhall is investigating the problem, but has not yet issued a full recall. The affected model is the Zafira B. It is thought that 280,000 of them are currently on the road in the UK. The alarm was raised by three different women, who say their cars burst into flames. Among them was Sue Freemantle, from Devon, who had four children in her Zafira when a fire began behind the dashboard. Claire Wheatley also from Devon, had to evacuate her car along with her husband when a similar incident occurred. They and others have posted pictures of the fires on Facebook. Vauxhall has already examined 20 such cars which have been burned out, and has summoned engineers from Germany to investigate. In a statement, it said it thought the heating and ventilation system was to blame. It said previous repairs may have been carried out improperly, or in some cases, non-genuine parts may have caused the fires. The affected models have manual air-conditioning, as pictured above. Owners who have electronic climate control have not reported any problems. The cars, all right-hand drive, were built between 2005 and 2014. Anyone who has concerns about their vehicle is being asked to contact their dealer.	Carmaker Vauxhall is trying to contact hundreds of thousands of British drivers, over worries their Zafira models could catch fire.
The committee is intending to investigate the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio. Its chairman Daithí McKay said they had written to Michael Noonan asking him to ensure Nama appeared at the inquiry. However, they said Mr Noonan has so far not responded. Mr McKay said: "Nama have a responsibility to come before the committee to answer questions and it is disappointing that Michael Noonan has so far not responded. "Officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) will attend the committee inquiry tomorrow [Thursday] and I look forward to their contribution. "The finance committee and the wider public are entitled to access the truth about the sale of the Nama assets." The committee postponed its first hearing of the inquiry last week, but is due to meet again on Thursday. Mr McKay had said they wanted to ensure they did not prejudice a police investigation or any potential criminal trial. The National Crime Agency is leading the criminal inquiry into the Nama loan sale controversy and is concerned its investigation could be undermined. The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) is the Republic of Ireland's "bad bank", set up to deal with toxic loans during the Irish banking crisis. Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than £1bn last year. An Irish politician, Mick Wallace, has alleged that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a Northern Ireland politician in the wake of the deal. Mr Wallace told the Irish parliament the money had been moved for that purpose to an Isle of Man bank account controlled by the Belfast solicitor Ian Coulter. Mr Coulter is the former managing partner of Tughans solicitors in Belfast and worked on behalf of the buyers in the Nama deal. He said he had directed that money be transferred to the Isle of Man account for "a complex, commercially and legally-sensitive" reason. He said that no politician, nor any relative of any politician, was ever to receive any money. The money moved to the Isle of Man was later retrieved, though Mr Coulter and and his former partners at Tughans remain at odds on the circumstances of that transaction. BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme has established the Isle of Man account was intended to facilitate payments to non-lawyers or deal fixers. All those involved in the deal deny any wrongdoing.	Stormont's finance committee has said it is "disappointed" that the Irish finance minister has not replied to its request for Nama officials to appear before its inquiry.
Media playback is not supported on this device So for the players of Hawk Green 1st XI from Marple, it might have been something of a dream to have a bowl at Michael Vaughan or face a Devon Malcolm delivery. But on a sunny evening in Cheshire, Vaughan, joined by an England legends team including Malcolm, Neil Fairbrother and Adam Hollioake amongst others, turned out to take on Hawk Green's finest on their own turf. Having done a coaching session with the club's youngsters and a Q&A session the England Legends were put into bat first in this Twenty20 encounter, one of three matches the legends have scheduled in order to raise funds for grass roots cricket. Vaughan fell for 17 as the home side made an encouraging start with the ball but the form of Mal Loye, who top-scored for England Legends with 117, ensured the visitors set a tough mark of 194. It was a target which, despite Justin Blackhurst's impressive 88, proved to be too much for the Derbyshire and Cheshire League outfit, who could only make 165 in 20 overs to leave the legends once again victorious. Scorecard. To find out how you can get involved in cricket go to our  pages.	They have graced the finest cricket stadia all over the world, played for England against the greatest players and come out on top.
This year's award was won jointly by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian peace activist, and Yemeni pro-democracy campaigner Tawakkol Karman. They were recognised for their "non-violent struggle" for women's safety and for women's rights to participate in peace-building work. Chinese lawyer Liu Xiaobo won in 2010. Each of this year's winners was presented with a gold medal and a diploma. The prize money of $1.5 million (Â£958,000) will be shared between them. Mrs Sirleaf, 72, is Africa's first elected female head of state and is credited with helping to end Liberia's 14 year civil war. The announcement of her award came days before the country's presidential election. She went on to win a run-off poll last month but her rival boycotted the vote alleging the first round was rigged. The Liberian president told delegates that she was honoured to be following in the footsteps of the Africans who had won the prize before her, including South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Kofi Annan, the Ghana-born former UN secretary-general. Mrs Sirleaf also expressed her "deepest sympathy" for the people of Norway in the wake of the twin attacks carried out by Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July that led to the deaths of 77 people. "On behalf of all the women of Liberia, the women of Africa, and women everywhere in the world who have struggled for peace, justice and equality, I accept with humility the 2011 Nobel Prize for Peace," she said. Ms Gbowee, 39, led a peaceful campaign to end Liberia's civil war and oust its ex-President Charles Taylor. She said: "I am humbled and honoured to have been selected and I receive the prize in the name of women who continue to work for peace, equality and justice across the world." "I believe that the prize this year not only recognises our struggle in Liberia and Yemen. "It is in recognition and honour of the struggles of grass roots women in Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire [Ivory Coast], Tunisia, in Palestine and Israel, and in every troubled corner of the world." Ms Karman, a 32-year-old mother of three, founded the organisation Women Journalists Without Chains in 2005 and becomes the first Arab woman to win the prize. 'Freedom and dignity' Addressing the audience in Arabic, she said: "Thank you for the award, which I consider as an honour to me personally, to my country Yemen, to Arab women, to all women of the world, and to all people aspiring to freedom and dignity. Recent Nobel Peace Prize winners "I accept the award on my behalf and on behalf of the Yemeni and Arab revolutionary youth, who are leading today's peaceful struggle against tyranny and corruption with moral courage and political wisdom." Speaking before the presentation at Oslo's City Hall, Thorbjorn Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said: "We congratulate this year's winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. "You represent one of the most important motive forces for change in today's world, the struggle for human rights in general and the struggle of women for equality and peace in particular." The Nobel committee received a record 241 nominations for the 2011 prize. The first Nobel peace prize was awarded in 1901 and the award takes its name from the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel.	The 2011 Nobel Peace Prize has been presented to three women at a ceremony in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.
The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months. And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. "I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit," joked Wright, 53. "I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. "That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone." As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. "It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. "I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. "I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen." Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. "There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back," said the Northern Irishman. "I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. "It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas." Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. "I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days," he said. "Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. "But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. "So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). "We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. "The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players." Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  "having good people and a good squad". On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.	Tommy Wright is ready for a new season in charge of St Johnstone despite his chairman fearing he would leave.
Syed, 35, is serving a life sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee in 1999. His defence team is trying to reopen the case based on some of the questions raised in the Serial podcast over whether Syed had received a fair trial. A judge in Baltimore has allowed lawyers to submit new evidence for the first time since his conviction. Serial, which was released in weekly instalments at the end of last year, became a global hit, breaking records as the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads on iTunes. In it, journalists went through every detail in the investigation into the death of Lee, for which her ex-boyfriend Syed was convicted. Apparent errors and possible new evidence were discovered by the Serial team, leading to calls for a new investigation. Lawyers will now be allowed to present new evidence on two fronts: the reliability of mobile phone records and the testimony of a potential alibi. In the 2000 trial, prosecutors relied heavily on mobile phone records that allegedly placed Syed at a park in Baltimore where Lee's body was buried. Syed, who was 17 at the time, has always maintained his innocence. But a motion filed in court in August said a newly recovered mobile phone document showed "the cell tower evidence was misleading and should have never been admitted at trial". The new hearing, a date for which has yet to be decided, will also hear evidence from a potential alibi for Syed. Asia McClain, a friend of Syed's who was not heard in the original trial, claims to have seen him in a library at the time of the suspected killing. The fact that Syed's first lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to submit this evidence in the original trial was one of the arguments used to win him the right to appeal in February. Court papers show the hearing will also look at why Syed's defence team did not present Ms McLain as a witness and whether there was "potential prosecutorial misconduct" as a result.	Lawyers for Adnan Syed, the subject of the hit US podcast Serial, will be allowed to present new evidence in his case after a court ruling on Friday.
The discovery was made at Whitehills harbour at about 13:30. Police Scotland said: "Inquiries into the circumstances are at an early stage."	A body has been found in the water at an Aberdeenshire harbour.
The pound started to rise just before the first results came in as traders predicted a win for the Remain side - eventually hitting a high of over $1.50. But as reality sank in and the Leave side pulled away the currency went into freefall touching lows of $1.30, levels not seen since 1985. Since then the pound has had some better days but has still lost over 13% of its value against the dollar. The value of a nation's currency is often described as its effective share price - a gauge of how investors see the strength of the economy. "The fall in the pound can be seen as a barometer of sentiment in the markets," says Jeremy Stretch, a currency analyst at CIBC. "If a currency falls traders are effectively saying that it needs to go lower to make it attractive enough for them to make investments." Despite having fallen to lows we have not seen for 30 years, some in the market think the pound could still fall further against the dollar. "When you look at how quickly the pound has fallen in the past, I don't think it is beyond the bounds of possibility that we could see the pound in the low $1.20 range against the dollar," says Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. So what does history tell us about one of the key drivers of the UK economy? November 2007: sterling reached $2.11 The pound soared from $1.40 in 2002 right up to $2.10 in October 2007. British tourists flocked to the US as the pound strengthened, often coming backed weighed down with suitcases full of clothes and gadgets. "It was in some respects the golden days for the UK with a booming financial sector and the sense of 'Cool Britannia' in the country," says Prof Albrecht Ritschl an economic historian at the London School of Economics. The pound strengthened as the UK economy boomed, inflation stayed relatively low and interest rates offered a decent return for investors. "It was a very settled economic environment with few political upheavals, completely different from the post-Brexit world we see today," says Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. Those heady days of economic boom were replaced with the financial crisis of 2008 which saw the pound collapse as the UK economy fell into recession. The pound fell 35% to lows of about $1.40 in early 2009, before picking up as the UK slowly emerged from the downturn. February 1985: Sterling reached $1.05 Back in February 1985, the pound slid to $1.05. But unlike today it was less a story of pound weakness and more to do with a very strong dollar. The combination of Ronald Reagan as US president and the tenure of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve saw the dollar appreciate 26% between 1980 and 1984. President Reagan instituted a series of tax cuts and spending rises in an attempt to revive the economy. This in turn pushed up long-term interest rates, attracting inflows of capital and pushing up the value of the dollar. Despite the pressure of the strong dollar, the UK economy was performing well at the time with economic growth of 2.3% in 1984 and 4.2% in 1985. The strength of the dollar created international tension which was addressed in an unprecedented meeting of world leaders and central bankers at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September 1985. The central bankers agreed that other currencies should appreciate against the dollar and followed their words with interventions in foreign exchange markets, selling dollars in exchange for other currencies. The actions of those involved in the so-called "Plaza Accord" contributed to the dollar falling 40% between 1985 and 1987. The pound gained ground on the dollar in the months that followed, hitting $1.88 in December 1987.	As the nation anxiously waited for the EU referendum results last month, currency traders were busy making bets on which way the vote would go.
All 108 MLAs met to sign the roll of membership, with 29 newly-elected members doing so for the first time. The Ulster Unionists announced they will form an opposition. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said "let battle commence". Mr Nesbitt, said the first and deputy first minister would not have the support of his party at the executive table, as the "Ulster Unionist MLA group have unanimously decided to form the first official opposition of this Northern Ireland Assembly". He said: "This is a big and bold move to bring a better and a more normal democracy to the people of Northern Ireland - let battle commence!". Mr McGuinness said Mr Nesbitt's move was "deeply disappointing" and a "huge mistake". "It will be seen as a lack of leadership," he added. SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) leader Colum Eastwood said they have some work to do before making any decisions. Alliance party leader David Ford congratulated Mr Nesbitt on the "sound bite of the day". "Some of us recognise that government is a bit more substantial than the sound bite of the day" he said. The DUP's Robin Newton has been elected as the new speaker, replacing Mitchel McLaughlin, who announced his retirement before the election. Mr Newton said he wants to "uphold the standards that his predecessors have set". "The people of Northern Ireland are looking to us," he added. "I want to prove to them that we are moving forward." Sinn Féin's Caitríona Ruane, the SDLP's Patsy McGlone and the UUP's Danny Kennedy have been elected as deputy speakers. Ms Ruane has been elected as the principal deputy speaker. People Before Profit Alliance MLAs Eamonn McCann and Gerry Carroll were among the newly-elected members signing the roll. Mr Carroll revealed via social media that when they were asked to designate as "unionist, nationalist or other", he and Mr McCann wrote "socialist". "We will be put in the 'other' camp, but we are clear where we stand," he said. "This isn't the Alliance Party. This is the new socialist alternative." MLAs also undertook to support the rule of law, challenge paramilitary activity and accept no authority but a democratic mandate. Live coverage of proceedings at the new NI assembly The full Northern Ireland Executive will be formed when a programme for government has been agreed. The parties, who were given an outline of a framework for government programme on Tuesday, have until Thursday to make a response. Negotiations on the framework could go on for two weeks. In last week's election, the Democratic Unionist Party maintained the 38 seats it held in the last assembly, while Sinn Féin lost one and now holds 28. The Ulster Unionists have 16 seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party lost two and now have 12. The Alliance Party secured eight seats during the election, meaning it does not have enough seats to automatically qualify for a ministerial department.	The DUP's Arlene Foster has been reappointed as Northern Ireland first minister and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister, with the UUP announcing they will form an opposition at the Stormont assembly.
A deal was made by the two main parties and the British and Irish governments to resolve a crisis at Stormont. Solutions were found on issues over paramilitarism and welfare reform. But Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said a lack of consensus over how to deal with the past was a let-down to police and Troubles victims' families. DCC Harris said an extra Â£160m of government funding to tackle dissident republicans that was agreed in the deal was much needed. He added the agreement's initiatives to tackle paramilitarism and organised crime were also positive. But a proposed new independent Historical Investigations Unit, which would have taken on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) responsibility for outstanding Troubles murder investigations, has not yet been approved. DCC Harris said: "We are on record as saying the formation of a Historical Investigations Unit would provide an opportunity for a more structured and coherent approach to dealing with the past, allowing the PSNI to concentrate primarily on keeping people safe today." He said that in absence of that body the PSNI would have to ensure its "finite resources are used in the most effective manner". "We must balance keeping people safe today with our continued duties in relation to the past. "The reality is the financial challenges facing us will continue to have a direct impact on how we respond to the demands of the past and the pace at which those demands can be serviced." Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said talks on the legacy of the past failed because the government would not commit to full disclosure of classified documents relating to Troubles incidents on national security grounds. He added: "That pretext for blocking disclosure is clearly nonsense as much of the information families are looking for is related to events 30 to 40 years ago." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, who helped broker the agreement, is to meet relatives of Troubles victims to discuss their concerns over the deal. It had been a "bitter pill for victims to swallow", according the the victims' commissioner Judith Thompson. She said victims "deserve respect and consideration and they cannot be shunted off into a dead end". "It is not good enough to build up hopes for the most comprehensive set of proposals yet to address victims' and survivors' needs and then fail to deliver." Ms Thompson added that politicians must give a timescale for "the issues that are being put in the 'too difficult' box once again". Alan McBride, whose wife was killed in the IRA's 1993 bombing of a fishmonger's on Belfast's Shankill Road, said he was uncertain whether legacy issues would ever be resolved. "My frustration is that they're not going to be able to agree on this, so therefore there's going to be another opportunity wasted," he said. "There is talking still on going, and that has got to be welcomed, because we have to give out hope to victims and survivors." Mike Ritchie, a case work manager for the Relatives for Justice victims' group, said that while he was disappointed with the outcome of the political negotiations, he would prefer no deal to "a bad deal". "To set up a bad process again would be very difficult for victims' families," Mr Ritchie said. "If we're going to have a deal let's have a good deal." He added that pressure would remain on Northern Ireland's politicians to deal with legacy issues. "This isn't going away. I think that we'll be back talking about this in due course."	A senior police officer has said he is disappointed the latest Northern Ireland political agreement has not addressed the legacy of the Troubles.
The adult female's remains - including a head and hands found in a bag - were discovered in eight locations, Irish police have confirmed. They are investigating whether the death is linked to a personal dispute. More than 200 gardaÃ­ (police), Irish soldiers and civil defence personnel are continuing to search the area. The man arrested remains in police custody in Bray, 20km (12 miles) south of Dublin, where he can be questioned for up to 24 hours. He presented himself to GardaÃ­ in County Wexford on Tuesday night and was subsequently arrested, Irish broadcaster RTE reported. The focus of the murder investigation changed following a series of developments on Tuesday evening. The results of DNA tests from the partial torso discovered by two walkers in the undergrowth, close to Military Road, on Saturday night showed the body was that of a woman. More human remains, including a head and hands, were discovered over a 30km-area on Tuesday. Police said they had now recovered most of the remains, and that there is only one victim. Supt Pat Ward, described the unprecedented case as "troubling". "We are conscious of the fact that the body found is that of a loved one," he said. "What we have found are limbs, we've also found some significant parts of the torso and we've also found in one of the locations, in a bag, the head and the hands of the deceased," he added.	A 32-year-old man is being questioned in connection with the murder of a woman whose body was cut up and dispersed in the Wicklow Mountains.
The supporters had been on a stadium tour but managed to cut themselves off from the remainder of the party. They were found on Saturday morning during a security sweep of the stadium before being handed over to police, who decided not to arrest the pair. United say there was no risk to supporters attending the Arsenal game. The pair had been searched and their belongings put through a metal detector before they went on the tour. The incident comes six months after United's Premier League game against Bournemouth at Old Trafford had to be called off at short notice when a suspect package was found in a toilet in the corner of the stadium. It turned out to be a fake explosive left behind after a training exercise earlier in the week.	Two Manchester United fans spent Friday night undetected in an Old Trafford toilet in an attempt to see Saturday's Premier League game against Arsenal.
Albert II warned against the dangers of populists seeking scapegoats for current economic difficulties. Flemish separatist leader Bart De Wever assumed the remarks were aimed at him and said he had overstepped his role. Belgian political experts and commentators argued that the broadcast had intervened in political debate. In his broadcast, the king said that "in these troubled times we live in, we should remain vigilant and see through populist arguments". Populists were, he said, "trying to find scapegoats for the crisis, whether foreigners or compatriots from another part of the country". Such thinking persisted in Belgium as much as in other European countries and "the crisis of the 1930s and the populist reactions of that time must not be forgotten", the king said. Belgium has a deepening divide between its Flemish (Dutch-speaking) north and French-speaking south, and there has been speculation that the country could ultimately break up. Mr De Wever, whose New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party made big gains in elections in October and is now the biggest political force in Flemish-speaking Flanders, accused the king of "implicitly" referring to the N-VA in his speech. In a newspaper article in De Standaard, he accused the king of choosing "the path of a royalty of division", adding in a later broadcast interview that he could no longer see the monarch as playing the constitutional role of referee. On Belgian radio he accused Belgium's French-speaking PM, Elio Di Rupo, of "hiding behind the throne", arguing that he must have seen an advance copy of the speech and given it the green light. "[Di Rupo] won't say I'm a fascist but apparently believes it and lets the king say it," Mr De Wever said. The separatist leader also took a swipe at a predecessor of Albert's, Belgium's wartime King Leopold III (then a prisoner of war), who met Adolf Hitler "for coffee" at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria in 1940 and took Belgium "to the brink of civil war". Mr De Wever's angry remarks followed a series of objections from political commentators and academics. Prof Carl Devos of Ghent University said that the passage of the speech should have been dropped, while monarchy expert Prof Mark Van den Wijngaert said a comparison with the 30s was "a bridge too far". But another Flemish political leader, socialist Bruno Tobback, said the monarch was merely expressing what other European heads of state had said in their Christmas messages. Sociologist Benoit Scheuer told La Libre Belgique that it was fine for the king to warn of the dangers of populism, although he believed the major democratic parties should speak out as well. King Albert has taken a strong position before on Belgium's political difficulties and the monarch does traditionally play a role in attempting to resolve constitutional problems. In July 2011, Albert gave an emotional televised address, appealing to political leaders to display "modern citizenship" to bring an end to a drawn-out crisis, which left the country without an elected government for a world-record one-and-a-half years. In an apparent foretaste of his controversial Christmas message, the king warned viewers at the time that if their political impasse remained unresolved, they risked the emergence of a form of "poujadism", referring to a right-wing populist movement in 1950s France.	The Belgian king has provoked a sharp response to a Christmas message in which he drew parallels with the rise of fascism in the 1930s.
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said Labour needed a leader to win elections, not "return to the politics of the 1970s or 1950s". Fellow ministers Vaughan Gething and Ken Skates support Andy Burnham, while three Labour AMs back Jeremy Corbyn. No AMs have publicly come out in support of Liz Kendall. First Minister Carwyn Jones has not named his preferred candidate, but has said veteran left-winger Mr Corbyn would be an "unusual choice" for the party. On Wednesday, Mr Andrews said he understood the "romantic appeal of anti-austerity politics", but said Labour had to be able to win power to change things. At the general election in May, Labour had "appeared both pro-austerity and economically incompetent, which was a hell of an achievement", he added. "Labour must either be in the business of bringing change or else it is worthless," he said. Declaring his support for Ms Cooper, Mr Andrews said Labour needed a leader "who looks and sounds different from the blokeish Westminster culture, who understands that the personal is political". Mr Corbyn, who ended a two-day campaign visit to Wales with a rally in Cardiff on Tuesday, has more nominations from local parties in Wales and across the UK than any of the other three contenders. But the only Welsh MP to nominate him - Huw Irranca-Davies - said he only did so to ensure a broad range of candidates, and that he intended to vote for Ms Cooper. Mr Burnham has the backing of nine Welsh MPs and four AMs, while Ms Cooper has support from eight Welsh MPs and four AMs. Ms Kendall is backed by five Welsh MPs but no AMs, while Mr Corbyn has support from three AMs. The winner, to be chosen by a vote of Labour party members, will be named on 12 September.	Yvette Cooper has been urged to "show her passion for change" by a Welsh government minister backing her for the Labour leadership.
Comley, 20, has played twice for the R's first-team and signed a two-year deal at Loftus Road in May, having been with the club since the age of nine. His full debut came as a substitute in last season's 5-1 Premier League defeat by Leicester City. "We like what we've seen from Brandon and we think we can work with him," Carlisle boss Keith Curle said. The Islington-born midfielder, who featured in a trial match for Carlisle against Barrow, will return to his parent club on 20 February.	Carlisle United have signed midfielder Brandon Comley from from Queens Park Rangers on a one-month youth loan.
But does it? Is the problem any worse than it ever was in north Wales' biggest town, and are Wrexham's problems any worse than any other similarly-sized area? Lisa is a former drug addict. By her own admission, she used to take every drug available to her. She has been five years in recovery though, and now works with charity and support services provider CAIS, trying to help users who want to go into recovery. Few know Wrexham's drug scene better than her, and she does not believe the number of drug users in Wrexham has increased in the last decade. Nor does she believe Wrexham's drug problem is any worse than any other comparable town. "I think it's everywhere," she said. "This problem is everywhere in all towns. Some are just hidden more than others." What has changed dramatically though, is the type of drugs many people are now using. New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) - some of which were formerly known as so-called "legal highs" - are now the choice drug of many users. "People are taking that (NPS) more than they're taking heroin," said Lisa. "Heroin's dropping, crack cocaine is dropping and the NPS in increasing. I believe it's because it's cheaper, the quality's better - the quality of that man-made drug is better." Lisa also describes NPS as "sociable drugs," which users tend to take with others. Often, she says, users congregate together to take the drugs, making the problem more visible, and possibly creating a perception drugs use is rising. NPS are typically much cheaper than heroin or other drugs, and can be bought, Lisa says, for about Â£5. She also knows of some users buying single-hit "one-pops" for as little as Â£1. Despite their price, she says the NPS are frighteningly strong - often more powerful than heroin. "They are stronger. From the effects we're seeing with people, they are definitely stronger, and that's why a lot of heroin users are now swapping to the NPS." She says some users are left "zombified". "They don't know where they are; they don't know their own names. The first 10 minutes...they could easily walk out in the road. It really does dislocate them." Lisa says that on average, a new batch of NPS hits Wrexham's streets every three weeks. They bear new names, and the effects on users often differ. Black Mamba is one of the better-known substances available in Wrexham. The latest - which began to emerge a fortnight ago - is called Triple X. You know when a new batch hits the streets, she says, because users look like zombies as they adjust to the new effects. Some then develop a tolerance to it - until the next release comes along. The constant release of new substances presents huge challenges for those trying to combat their effects. Carry Burton is a harm reduction manager with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. She helps run a mobile outreach service for users. Asked how worrying the new trend is, she says: "Certainly for us as a health service, it does pose serious concerns. We are worried about people's health. We are concerned about people's safety. For heroin users, if they overdose on heroin we have Naloxone that we can give to save lives. We can't do that with new psychoactives, so we have to find alternative interventions. "We are...very keen to try and keep people healthy, but how best to do that still remains a bit of a question mark really for us all." She believes other towns of a similar size probably experience similar problems to Wrexham. However, in north Wales - with the exception of the "odd little pocket here and there" - the harm reduction team are only witnessing the rise of NPS in Wrexham. Some believe that could be because Wrexham has a relatively high concentration of charities or service providers which help drug users, homeless people, or others in need. Dave Jolly, North Wales Police's chief inspector for the Wrexham area, says: "I think Wrexham is unique from the point of view of the visibility." He adds: "I think what you've got now is a collective group of about 47 men and women who are generally moving from one service provision to another within their day...predominantly they hang around the town centre, so their visibility is enhanced." While Lisa from CAIS believes many heroin users are now switching to NPS, Chief inspector Jolly says he knows of heroin users who are trying Black Mamba and "shunning it" because they don't like the "adverse reaction". "If they're running away from it, then clearly there's something about it that's very sinister." He admits the problem with NPS is probably going to get worse for Wrexham and other areas. A "joined-up approach" between health professionals and other services providers, supported by police, is what is needed to combat the problem, he says, and to try and "understand why these people are doing what they're doing".	When pictures of people apparently high on drugs in Wrexham's bus station were posted on social media earlier this month, it prompted claims by some the town has a major drugs problem.
Milkins' five losses in-a-row, saw the 40-year-old slip to 31st in the world rankings, but he ended his slump with a 6-1 win over Hamza Akbar. "I was under a lot of pressure because I just haven't won a match for ages. "That is such a weight off my shoulders winning that. I needed it money-wise and ranking-wise," Milkins said. The Gloucester potter, who plays Hammad Miah in the second round at the weekend, had his best run at the UK Championship in 2002 when he reached the quarter-finals. He added: "I feel like I am going to take off but because I haven't won a match it has been really difficult. When things aren't going they aren't going, but maybe that is just the win I needed. "I played alright. There weren't a lot of breaks but I didn't miss many balls. "I have been playing so well in practice and I think that practice has got me through a few frames because I was really sharp. "It's really tough when you are losing, any little thing can put you off. The last two or three matches I have lost because of my head and not because of how I have been playing. You get in a rut but I am out of it now."

The BBC's James Landale says he is going voluntarily at the age of 52, while he still has time to pursue a second career in business. His departure, which was discussed with David Cameron over the festive break, came as a surprise after 25 years on the front bench for the Conservatives. He will be replaced by Lord Hill of Oareford, a former John Major aide, who entered the Lords in 2010. Prime Minister David Cameron praised Lord Strathclyde's contribution, describing him as a "brilliant public servant". Speaking at the launch of the coalition government's mid-term review, Mr Cameron said he was "sad to see him go" as he "knew the House of Lords inside out" and had done a great job on behalf of both the government and his party. The then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave Lord Strathclyde his first job as a whip in the 1980s and he has been on the front bench in the Lords ever since. He has served six party leaders, including three prime ministers. The BBC's James Landale says his friends insist there is absolutely no political reason for his departure. It is just, they say, that he feels he has done his time. The peer has been the Tory leader in the Lords for 14 years since his predecessor Lord Cranborne was sacked by William Hague in 1998 for "running in like an ill-trained spaniel" and negotiating secretly with Tony Blair over Lords' reform. By James LandaleDeputy political editor He was also a minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry during the 1990s and his various junior ministerial jobs covered tourism, Scotland, the environment, and consumer affairs. In his resignation letter to Mr Cameron, Lord Strathclyde says: "When I was invited to join the government by Margaret Thatcher in 1988, I never believed it was a career for life. I didn't expect it would consume me for as long as it has or that I would one day lead the Lords and sit in a cabinet. "The Lords is an extraordinary and vigorous place, but recently I've been considering a change of direction. "I started my working life in the private sector and at some stage always hoped to return, I would now like to do so... I do not see a political career as the cap of everything and would like, while there is still time, to take up other threads of my life and other interests." He added: "I always promised myself that when I did leave I would do so when I could make a smooth handover to a strong successor. Whatever my feelings on the matter, reform of the Lords is effectively over and now is a good time to manage that handover." In his letter of reply, the PM said that "after a quarter of a century on the front bench I entirely understand your desire to pursue other interests". He added: "You have been an outstanding Leader of the Lords. Under your leadership the Lords has enhanced its role as our second legislative chamber. Your assured handling of business of the House and your understanding of its traditions and practices have earned you the deep respect of Peers across the House. "You have ensured the House has continued to play its unique role in the governance of the United Kingdom with great distinction." Lord Strathclyde will be replaced by education minister Lord Hill of Oareford, who was most recently in the news after Mr Cameron apparently missed his attempt to resign during a meeting in the most recent cabinet reshuffle. Lord Hill  - the same age as his predecessor - faces a difficult job in which he will have to guide legislation through an Upper House where tensions have been on the rise. The coalition has suffered more than 50 defeats since 2010 in the Lords and Lord Strathclyde raised eyebrows in July when he accused veteran Labour peer Lord Barnett of "gross discourtesy". There were also disputes in the Lords before Christmas over his handling of a change in business which  avoided a vote in the Lords on plans to change parliamentary boundaries - a vote which the Conservatives were thought likely to lose. Lord Hill, who was political secretary to John Major in the 1990s and a special adviser to Ken Clarke in the 1980s, was made a peer and became an education minister after the coalition came to power in May 2010.	Lord Strathclyde has resigned from his cabinet role as Leader of the Lords.
They were denied a win as Andre Ayew's deflected free-kick cancelled out Kelechi Iheanacho's close-range opener. The draw leaves them three points ahead of Manchester United, whose final game, against Bournemouth, was abandoned. City's vastly superior goal difference means United would need a 19-0 win over the Cherries to take fourth place. Listen to BBC Radio 5 live commentary of the goals In many ways, Manchester City's display at the Liberty Stadium was a fitting way to end an underwhelming season that began with such promise before limping to a satisfactory but below-par conclusion. Iheanacho - the on-field embodiment of a potentially exciting future - again demonstrated his sharpness in front of goal to poke home the opening goal after a Sergio Aguero shot had been saved in the fifth minute. It was the 19-year-old's 14th goal of the season and his eighth from his first 12 shots on target in the Premier League. But he and his side failed to build on it, missing numerous chances to put the game to bed, with the young forward and his usually lethal Argentine partner Aguero particularly wasteful. It left them vulnerable to a Swansea equaliser - which came courtesy of a 25-yard Ayew free-kick that deflected in off Fernando's head - and a potentially devastating second in a tense second half for the away side. In securing a top-four finish, Pellegrini has achieved the very minimum required of him before handing over to Pep Guardiola this summer, but it does not mask the failings of the Chilean's final campaign. Despite winning the League Cup for a second time in three years and going further in the Champions League than ever before, City's expensively assembled squad have underachieved in the league. Their haul of 66 points is their lowest in the top-flight since the 2008-09 season - the first under Sheikh Mansour's ownership. Pellegrini leaves the Etihad with a league title to his name, the best win percentage of any Premier League manager barring Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho and as the only City boss to have never finished below United. But after starting so strongly, his reign has limped to its conclusion with a squad in need of an overhaul. Media playback is not supported on this device In their previous two matches, Swansea had ended the top-four hopes of both Liverpool and West Ham. Despite resting goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, captain Ashley Williams and top scorer Gylfi Sigurdsson and being without Ki Sung-yueng because of his military service in South Korea, boss Francesco Guidolin came close to making it a hat-trick. Since the Italian joined the club in January, the Swans have improved significantly, losing only five of his 16 matches in charge. And they once again demonstrated their newly acquired stubbornness to extend their unbeaten home run to five games, during which they have conceded just twice. Having tied Guidolin down to a two-year deal this week, the Swans will be optimistic of building on this next season and avoiding the kind of poor form that prompted his arrival. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: "I am happy because the moment was not simple in January [when he took over]. Now we have a comfortable position in the table. I am happy. I am proud. My players deserve this position because we have a good team." "It was a good performance, a good result, against in my opinion he best team in the Premier League in terms of quality, a lot of big, big players. And the game was good, we played well. "I am happy, now. Only this for us and our players. This is a good memory." Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini to BBC Sport: "I wanted to win the Premier League this season, but the atmosphere from February when the club announced the new manager was maybe not the best atmosphere. Media playback is not supported on this device "We lost two important games at home when we were three points behind the leaders. "The only option we had today was that we needed to get the point to get Champions League for next year." Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart, speaking to BBC Sport: "It is not what we set out to do at the start of the season but we will have to take it (fourth place). "It was strange day, getting the job done, barring a  mathematical freak, we have Champions League football next season. "At the start of the season, well into this season  we were well in the title race, but we let ourselves down, we will take positives of a trophy and semi-final of the Champions League, which was history for our club and we have Champions League next year and we have to take that.

People poured out of offices in the city centre after an evacuation warning sounded. At least one person has died. Donetsk has been surrounded for several weeks by Ukrainian forces battling pro-Russian rebels. The convoy of at least 260 lorries carrying Russian aid has now halted, after moving towards the border. There is continuing confusion over the final destination. On Thursday afternoon, the lorries had got to within a few miles of the border, where they had parked in a field, reports the BBC's Steve Rosenberg, who is following the convoy. We followed the convoy for about nine hours, having left Voronezh before dawn. The convoy turned off the main highway - the M04 -  on to a smaller road to the border. All the lorries are now parked here in a field. We asked one commander to show us the contents of the lorries. He selected one, and it contained sleeping bags. But it was just one of at least 260 lorries. I cannot say accurately what the contents of the others are. The lorries will wait here until the convoy is given orders - but there is no indication when that will be. I spoke to one driver. He was very anti-American and asked why the United States was trying to take Ukraine away from Russia. The key question now is what Russia does next. If it takes the convoy across the border, it will be seen by the Ukrainian authorities as a major provocation. Follow tweets @BBCSteveR Russia has dismissed as absurd claims that its convoy is a pretext to send military supplies to the rebels. But Ukraine has said the Russian convoy must be inspected by international monitors before it can be let in. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said that if this did not happen, "movement of the convoy will be blocked with all the forces available". Meanwhile, the situation is reported to be desperate in the rebel-held city of Luhansk, where civilians have been short of water, food and electricity for more than a week. Phone lines are also down as shelling continues. Artillery fire could be heard all around Donetsk on Thursday, with the authorities urging people to stay off the streets. Two shopping centres were reportedly hit. It was unclear who had fired the shells. One city resident,  Valentina Smirnova, told Associated Press as she cleared up rubble: "My son left and now I am staying with my daughter. I don't know what to do afterwards. Where should I run to after that?" A senior International Red Cross (ICRC) official, Laurent Corbaz, is flying to the Ukrainian capital Kiev and then on to Moscow to discuss the Russian aid initiative. The ICRC tweeted that it had made initial contact with the Russian convoy but that "many practical details are still to be clarified". Ukraine is also sending a humanitarian aid convoy to the east. Some 75 lorries with 800 tonnes of aid left Kiev, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk for Luhansk on Thursday morning, the presidential website said. Some 2,086 people have been killed since the conflict in the east began in mid-April, more than half of them in the past two weeks, the UN says. The violence began when pro-Russian rebels seized government buildings and tried to declare independence. The military launched an operation to retake the east, and stepped up its activities in June. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been visiting Crimea, where he announced he had approved a defence ministry plan to set up a "Russian military taskforce". However, Mr Putin also struck a conciliatory tone, saying: "We must calmly, with dignity and effectively, build up our country, not fence it off from the outside world." He added: "We do not intend, like some people, to dash around the world with a razor blade and wave that blade around. But everyone should understand that we also have such things in our arsenal." Russia annexed the territory from Ukraine in March, in a move that drew international condemnation.	Heavy shelling has hit the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk, amid a continuing row over a controversial Russian aid convoy.
He said new forests would slow flooding by trapping water with their roots. The idea of "rewilding" the uplands is catching on fast as parts of Britain face repeated flooding, with more rainfall on the way. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he would seriously consider innovative solutions like rewilding. The government has been criticised for being slow to capitalise on the benefits of capturing rain where it falls. Lord Rooker, a Labour peer, said too much emphasis had been attached to the look of the countryside rather than practical considerations like trapping water. "We pay the farmers to grub up the trees and hedges; we pay them to plant the hills with pretty grass and sheep to maintain the chocolate box image, and then wonder why we've got floods," he said. The idea of reintroducing forests into catchments has been strongly supported by several leading scientists. The government is sponsoring a handful of catchment trials to assess the potential of the upstream areas to catch water and send it slowly downhill. A research paper for the Environment Agency shows that some of the schemes, like partly damming streams with felled trees to cause local flooding, are highly unpredictable when employed on their own. If they divert rainfall on to surrounding fields that can actually make flooding downstream worse if the water then flows off the fields, bypassing bends in the river. But the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that reintroducing flood forests to upland areas can be highly effective - and potentially much cheaper than conventional flood defences. The author, Simon Dixon, said: "Complex forested floodplains dramatically slow water moving over them as they have an irregular surface covered by tree roots, upright tree trunks and dead wood." He explains the process this way: "As a simple analogy during a flood many 'packets' of water are delivered to the main trunk river from all its tributaries. "If the delivery of a single large 'packet' of water can be significantly delayed it will then arrive at the main river after the peak of the flood, and thus the main flood peak height has less 'packets' of water in it and is lower." The best results come, he says, when rivers are partly dammed and a forest is allowed to grow on the floodplain. "This shows substantial and predictable responses in downstream flood height," he said. This is exactly what would have happened if farmers had not been encouraged by government to maximise food production by felling forests to graze sheep on the uplands. Lord Rooker got the idea of reintroducing forests from an article by the green journalist George Monbiot, who complained that farmers are subsidised to keep sheep even though the grazing animals actually make flooding worse by compacting the earth. "Instead of a steady flow sustained around the year by trees in the hills, by sensitive farming methods, by rivers which are allowed to find their own course and their own level, to filter and hold back their waters through bends and braiding and obstructions, we get a cycle of flood and drought. We get filthy water and empty aquifers and huge insurance premiums and ruined carpets. And all of it at public expense," Mr Monbiot wrote earlier this month. The idea of catching water upstream is strongly supported by the water and environment professional body, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM). Its spokesman Katherine Pygott has previously told BBC News: "Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy. "Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country - but it is complicated, with many different organisations involved, and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven't seen that leadership." Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told me he would give serious consideration to innovative solutions to flooding, like rewilding. The government could theoretically encourage farmers to rewild key parts of their catchments using grants under the Common Agricultural Policy, but CIWEM say that at the moment it is much easier for farmers to get grants for wildlife protection than flood protection. Mr Paterson had hoped to divert more cash into a fund that could be used for these sort of measures but was overruled by the prime minister after a campaign by farmers demanding to keep the maximum amount of their grants into direct payments for farming - in effect, for owning land. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin	Britain should turn swathes of its upland pastures into woodland to help prevent flooding, according to a former environment minister, Lord Rooker.
Welsh language minister Alun Davies told AMs it would help efforts to reach that goal stay on the right track. Targets to meet growing demand for Welsh-speaking teachers and public sector workers will also be set. Culture committee chairwoman Bethan Jenkins said AMs had been told 70% more Welsh-medium teachers were needed. Mr Davies responded that around a third of teachers in Wales could speak Welsh, and that the challenge was to see if more of them would be willing to teach through the medium of Welsh. Earlier this month, Welsh language commissioner Meri Huws called for "radical change" in the education system to ensure all children under the age of seven were "immersed" in Welsh.	The Welsh Government will set a "framework" of five-year targets in its attempt to ensure a million people speak Welsh by 2050.
Of these 216 planets, 10 of them could potentially be home to some sort of life, because they are 'Earth-like'. This means they have 'rocky' characteristics, and they are located in the 'Goldilocks Zone' of their solar system. If a planet is in a 'Goldilocks Zone' it is not too hot or too cold, which means water can be in its liquid form there. The Kepler Telescope has made some amazing discoveries since it was launched in 2009, but here are the top five findings... In 2014 the telescope made a huge discovery by finding a planet nicknamed: 'Earth 2.0'. The planet called, Kepler-452b has been dubbed as 'Earth 2.0', because it shares many characteristics with our Earth, even though it is 1,400 light years away from us. The first potentially habitable planet the telescope found was Kepler-22b, way back in 2011. Scientists agreed the planet was could be liveable because it was the perfect distance from its sun. In April 2017 the telescope found a super-Earth. This is a planet called LHS 1140b. It is a good candidate for life and orbits a red dwarf star 40 light years away. However, scientists think the planet might have had an ocean made entirely out of magma! - which released steam into the atmosphere. In February 2017, Kepler discovered seven new Earth-sized exoplanets. Exoplanets are planets that orbit a different star to our Sun - in a different solar system to the one we are in. In 2011 Nasa discovered the first planet to orbit two suns! It is called Kepler-16b, and is roughly 200 light years away from Earth. Some scientists have compared it to Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine, from the Star Wars movies, which also had two suns.	Nasa's Kepler telescope has recently found 216 new planets, meaning it has now discovered more than 4000 potential new worlds!
The interim review of Liverpool's green and open spaces, commissioned by Mayor Joe Anderson, suggests an extra Â£4.50 contribution is needed per person. The proposal to increase council tax is one of 31 recommendations made in green activist Simon O'Brien's report. He warned that Liverpool was "heading to a brick wall" when it comes to maintaining open spaces in the city. Mr Anderson explained: "Sadly, the 58% cut to our budget by central government has left us grappling with the challenge of finding new ways to fund non-essential services, including maintenance of and investment in our green and open spaces." Former Brookside actor Mr O'Brien said: "As central government is cutting money left, right and centre, non-statutory provision is the first thing that goes. "I've suggested other things like tourist levies, which you can only set up nationally unfortunately. I think if we charge everyone who comes to stay in the city Â£1 a head, this problem goes away but we're not allowed to do that yet. "If I can see a way that maybe you could commercialise a park - perhaps you could put a cafÃ© or a health centre in and bring in revenue - that's good." He called for residents to give their feedback before a final report is produced.	A city's parks could be funded by an increase in council tax, a report has recommended.
While its recommended nationwide pay rate goes up from £7.85 an hour to £8.25 - an increase of 40p - in London the suggested rise is only 25p. Next year, when the government brings in a compulsory National Living Wage across the United Kingdom, there will be no separate rate for London. The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living. The capital's voluntary living wage - which is not legally enforceable - is assessed by the Living Wage Foundation and economists at the Greater London Authority. Mayor Boris Johnson's office estimates 724 employers in London have now signed up. Those employers now have six months to implement the new pay level. National minimum wage: The current mandatory minimum is £6.70 per hour for people aged 21 and over, and £5.30 for those aged 18 to 20 National Living Wage: This will be mandatory from April 2016 for workers aged 25 and above. It will initially be set at £7.20 an hour and is intended to exceed £9 an hour by 2020 London living wage: A voluntary higher rate of the living wage in the capital, which will rise from £9.15 to £9.40 an hour. There are currently no plans to make this scheme mandatory Mr Johnson said the move would help "pay the people who work hardest on lowest incomes decently". While he is a prominent supporter of the voluntary London living wage, he has resisted calls to make it mandatory, saying small businesses "would struggle with wage rigidity". Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan called in-work poverty "a shameful blight on our city", adding: "Neither the government nor the mayor are doing enough to turn things round." The Green Party highlighted disparity between the new recommended rate in London and the national minimum wage for Londoners aged 18 to 20, currently £5.30 an hour. Assembly Member Baroness Jones said: "The mayor should be making the case for raising the minimum wage in London to a living wage, especially for young Londoners."	The London living wage is to rise from £9.15 an hour to £9.40, the Living Wage Foundation campaign group has said.
It will give 40 million yen (Â£274, 000) to the Cartivator group that operates outside Toyota city in central Japan. The Nikkei Asian Review reports Toyota and its group companies have agreed in principle to support the project. So far crowdfunding has paid for development of the so-called Skydrive car, which uses drone technology and has three wheels and four rotors. Retro tech: Flying car prototypes Jet-propelled sky taxi tested in Germany Uber plans to test on-demand flying cars network by 2020 Measuring 9.5ft (2.9m) by 4.3ft (1.3m), Skydrive claims to be the world's smallest flying car. It has a projected top flight speed of 100km/h (62mph), while travelling up to 10m above the ground. The team of 30 volunteers developing the Skydrive car hopes its prototype could be used to light the Olympic flame when Tokyo hosts the summer games in 2020. Flying cars are something of a flavour-of-the-month at present, with firms from the US, Germany, Netherlands, China and Japan looking to turn science fiction into reality.	Japanese carmaker Toyota has announced its backing for a group of engineers who are developing a flying car.
Caven Vines claimed during an interview in January 2015 the MPs knew about the abuse but did not intervene. MPs Sir Kevin Barron and John Healey were awarded £40,000 each in libel damages at the High Court in London. Mr Justice Warby said the "offensive and wrong" allegation had caused "real anger and distress". Lawyers for the MPs said the allegation was "extremely grave" and could not have been more serious for politicians serving constituencies in the town, ahead of the General Election. Sir Kevin, MP for Rother Valley, said he felt an anxiety and unease that he had not felt in other campaigns, which made it "very stressful". His integrity "had been called into question which was a very grave matter", the hearing was told. Mr Healey, who represents Wentworth and Dearne, said the allegation had been damaging to his relationship with his constituents and had taken the focus away from things that needed to be done. He considered they had left "a very dark stain on him and his integrity" which might never fully be removed, the judge was told. Mr Vines, the former UKIP group leader in the town, claimed the pair had not suffered in any way, highlighting that both were returned to Parliament with an increased majority. Judge Warby recorded the judgment after concluding Mr Vines had failed to put forward any defence which could possibly succeed.	An ex-UKIP councillor has been ordered to pay £80,000 in damages to two Labour MPs over remarks he made about the Rotherham's child abuse scandal.
The bank said it aimed to raise $5.1bn through the rights issue and would cut 15,000 jobs by 2018. The news came as Standard Chartered announced a third-quarter pre-tax loss of $139m for the three months to September. After falling for much of the day, the FTSE 100 index closed higher. It rose by 0.34%, or 21.81 points, to 6,383.61, boosted by oil firms and miners, helped by a rise in the price of crude oil. Shares in housebuilders fell after broker Liberum cut its ratings on a number of companies in the sector arguing valuations were "too optimistic". Taylor Wimpey fell 5%, Barratt Developments dropped 3.85% and Persimmon was 2.4% lower. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.11% against the dollar to $1.540 but rose 0.55% against the euro to â‚¬1.4074.	(Close): Standard Chartered was the biggest faller on the market, dropping 8.7% after the Asia-focused bank announced plans for a big rights issue.
Mark Fitzpatrick's store was destroyed after explosives lit up the sky at neighbouring Southern Firework Factory in Southampton on 13 May. Hampshire Fire said plastic-wrapped cardboard boxes ignited after they were stacked close to a 300 watt lightbulb. Mr Fitzpatrick said rebuilding the business was a priority. He said he was "absolutely devastated" when he discovered the blaze at the family business on Bitterne Road West. "When I was coming over the Itchen bridge , I saw the smoke and I began screaming. The business is my life. The feeling I got when I saw the shop ablaze was absolutely horrendous - a feeling I never want to experience again," he said. No-one was injured during the incident but homes and properties within 100 metres (328 ft) of the fire were evacuated. Bitterne Manor Primary School was also closed. "There was just nothing I could do. It was gone. We were just lucky that nobody got hurt." Mr Fitzpatrick's daughter, Jessica said she feared her father would suffer a heart attack following the "emotional rollercoaster". "We have lost a lot - including three olive trees worth Â£2k each. The fixtures and fittings also need to be replaced. I don't know how much the clean-up bill will be - but it will be a lot." The family said they have set up a market stall in Southampton but hope to rebuild the store "as soon as possible".	A florist whose business was destroyed in a fire which set off explosions at a neighbouring fireworks factory has pledged to rebuild his business.
The accident happened on the Edinburgh bypass between Baberton and Dreghorn at about 17:00 on Monday. Police said a woman on the bus was taken to hospital with a "serious leg injury". Her injury is not thought to be life-threatening. Four other people who suffered minor injuries were also taken to hospital but were later released. The eastbound lane of the road was closed following the accident causing lengthy tailbacks. It was re-opened at 18:45.	Five people have been injured following a crash between a bin lorry, a bus and two cars.
Guernsey, who play in the eight tier of English football, will face Thamesmead Town on 20 August at Footes Lane. "To bring the iconic competition to Guernsey will be something special," said boss Tony Vance. When they were last drawn at home in 2013, the tie was moved as the ground was being used by a local rugby club. What was a second qualifying-round match against Dover Athletic in the 2013-14 competition was moved away from Footes Lane to the headquarters of the Sussex County Football Association after an agreement over a rearranged kick-off time could not be reached. The upcoming FA Cup campaign will be the fourth which Guernsey have taken part in, having first been introduced in 2013. "The FA Cup has never gone out of the UK and here's an opportunity when it's going to, so hopefully everyone embraces it," Vance told BBC Radio Guernsey. "Hopefully being a home draw we can be at full strength and have a good game. "It's taken five years to get this opportunity, so it's really pleasing and I hope it goes ahead and there are no issues that happen like last time with Dover." Thamesmead, who played Guernsey's fierce rivals Jersey in a pre-season friendly last year, play in the Isthmian League Division One North - the same step as Guernsey in the football pyramid. Under Football Association rules if a replay is needed after Guernsey have been drawn away, it has to take place at a neutral venue on the English mainland.	An FA Cup game will take place on the Channel Islands for the first time after Guernsey FC were drawn at home in next month's preliminary round.
The early birds will all be vying for the prime camping spots next to the main stages where Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Stormzy and Lorde will perform over the weekend. They'll be joined by 177,000 other revellers, musicians, stall holders and volunteers, who make the annual pilgrimage to Worthy Farm to drink in the proceedings before proceeding to the drink. And while the only thing you can predict about Glastonbury is its unpredictability, here are 12 things we're 99% certain will happen over the next five days. Yes, the UK is in the middle of a heat wave. Yes, the forecast says it will be dry. But if you turn up to Glastonbury with nothing but a pair of flip-flops and a floaty dress, you only have yourself to blame. Playing the Pyramid Stage is a huge honour and a terrifying prospect, all rolled into one globally-televised gift box. We've seen experienced bands like U2 and Gorillaz come unstuck and walk away humbled. But we've also seen underdogs like Pulp and Florence + The Machine triumph after being bumped into headline slots at the last minute. Who's going to get it right - and wrong - this year? Like these ones. Every year, festival founder Michael Eavis holds a press conference. And every year he claims the latest Glastonbury festival is better than every other Glastonbury festival ever, full stop, no comebacks. He will also drop a hint about next year's headliners ("they have six legs and they're from Cardiff"), prompting at least seven speculative articles on the NME website. In 2014, we stumbled across a Korean funk band called Sultans of Disco playing in The Rabbit Hole at two in the morning. Wearing matching dogtooth suits and playing an exuberant cover of the Ghostbusters theme, they were literally the best thing we saw all weekend. And yes, we were sober. That's the magic of Glastonbury: at any given moment your new favourite band could be around the next corner. (It could equally be a doughnut van - there seem to be a lot of those too.) If we had to single out a few rising acts, we'd say Norwegian pop singer Sigrid, gravel-voiced soul singer Josh Barry and folk trio Wildwood Kin will be among the acts winning people's hearts this year. Every year, thousands of mangled tents and sleeping bags are discarded by campers who can't be bothered to clean up after themselves. It costs the organisers Â£780,000 to clean up the mess, money that would otherwise be going to charity. So have some respect and bring your rubbish home with you. OK, so Galway Girl is essentially an insult to the people and music of Ireland. But Ed Sheeran just about makes up for it with his impressively charismatic and likeable stage shows. With years of incessant gigging under his belt, he's adept at working a big crowd - armed with just a microphone and his teeny, child-sized guitar. Eschewing a backing band, he builds his songs from scratch on stage, using a sampler and a foot pedal to build inventive layers of loops. The fact the technology could fail at any moment gives his gigs a sense of peril that more polished headline acts lack. Expect him to convert a few sceptics when he closes the festival on Sunday night. Where does it come from? How does it stay upright? What if someone gets trapped under it? Bonus points if it's taller than the bus. This always precedes a video of someone juggling. Which is the perfect time to put the kettle on and be thankful you're not at Glastonbury, being forced to watch someone juggling. Our mate heard it from the security guy on the Avalon Stage, who saw the setlist and swears it's true. Also, Rihanna is doing guest vocals on Get Lucky and we saw Bryan Ferry having a kebab in the Stone Circle. Don't try to retrieve it, whatever you do. 2017 has been almost uniformly rubbish, but standing in a field with 100,000 strangers, drinking sambuca from a plastic cup while Katy Perry belts out Firework in a spangly leotard will leave you with an enormous sense of well-being. Parklife! The BBC will broadcast more than 30 hours of Glastonbury on TV this weekend, with further coverage on Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and 6 Music, the BBC iPlayer and online.

South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit spent a "great deal of time" trying to "disprove" allegations, said HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. It said the force's public protection unit showed "a disregard for victims". A separate report on Tuesday found a "collective failure" by the authorities to stop child abuse in Rotherham. That inquiry, by Professor Alexis Jay, said at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited from 1997-2013, mainly by gangs of men of Pakistani heritage. The new investigation, which saw HMIC inspectors visit South Yorkshire Police in February, threatened to put more pressure on police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. He has so far resisted calls to resign as commissioner, with David Cameron and Nick Clegg the latest politicians to call for him to go. He has quit the Labour Party. Mr Wright was the councillor responsible children's services at Rotherham Borough Council between 2005 and 2010 . In a statement, Mr Wright said he had "formally" tendered his resignation from the Labour Party. But he insisted he was the most appropriate person to hold the office of police and crime commissioner (PCC). The HMIC report said South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit (PPU) had a cultural "disregard for victims". It criticised the unit for under-recording crime, highlighting the impact this had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault. The HMIC looked at 117 crimes that should have been recorded, but found that only 89 had been. Of those, three were wrongly classified. The report highlighted "a serious need for improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of crime recording decisions". It said: "There is an inherent risk that a significant number of reported offences of a serious nature have not been recorded and that vulnerable victims have, as a consequence, been left unprotected or at risk of further offending." The force welcomed the HMIC report, but it said it was important to note it was about the recording of crime and not the way it was investigated. "We recognise that systems need improving and there is a programme in place to do so, including IT and the force's public protection unit stand-alone system," the statement said. Rotherham isn't alone in facing the distressing problem of child sexual abuse. But the report exposed a deeply dysfunctional system here. The council insists things have improved significantly in recent years. Many, though, are still shocked that efforts to confront exploitation fell woefully short. Was there a particular problem specific to Rotherham? Did Labour's total dominance of this authority allow a complacent, rotten culture to develop? Was the political opposition so enfeebled that effective challenge to the leadership was striking by its absence? As people here reflect on these political questions, it's worth thinking for a moment about the complex, corporate identity of modern councils. Social workers report to safeguarding managers, child protection co-ordinators, directors of services, and chief executives. All overseen by 63 elected councillors. Such a complex web of relationships. So many different chains of command - making true accountability very hard to establish. South Yorkshire Police is already under scrutiny after Professor Jay's report criticised police for not making child sexual exploitation (CSE) a priority and "regarding many child victims with contempt". The force currently has 173 "live" investigations into suspected CSE. The number includes 32 probes in Rotherham, a spokeswoman for the force said. Supt Jason Harwin said that in the last 12 months in Rotherham 15 people had been prosecuted or charged with CSE-related offences. Neighbouring West Yorkshire Police has revealed there are currently 65 cases of CSE being investigated in the county.	The police force at the centre of the Rotherham child abuse scandal is still failing to record crimes against children properly, a report has said.
The British-Brazilian duo were beaten by South Africa's Raven Klaasen and American Rajeev Ram 6-1 6-4 in an hour at the O2 Arena in London. But Murray and Soares have already overtaken Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in the year-end rankings. After three round-robin match wins, they were outplayed by Klaasen and Ram. The latter pair will play Finland's Henri Kontinen and Murray's former partner, Australian John Peers, in Sunday's final. Kontinen and Peers beat the Bryan brothers 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 in their semi-final. Earlier, Jamie's brother Andy Murray kept his hopes alive of ending the season as the world number one singles player by beating Milos Raonic in a thrilling semi-final, which lasted three hours and 38 minutes.	New world number one doubles team Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares suffered a disappointing defeat in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals.
The last episode of the ITV show, which stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman, will air on Monday evening. Chris Chibnall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's a strange feeling actually, it's quite emotional. "It's been an extraordinary journey with the show and [its success] has taken us all by surprise." Did the critics like Broadchurch? Confirming the drama will not return for any future series, he said: "That is it and there will be no more after this one, absolutely." The storyline of the final series has centred around the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Julie Hesmondhalgh. Chibnall explained: "When I thought about telling this story, the first thing I did, along with the people I work with, was go and talk to various people and charities who worked supporting survivors of sexual assault. "We went to Dorset sexual assault referral centre and Rape Crisis and Survivors' Trust, and the question I asked them was 'Should we be telling this story in Broadchurch, is it an appropriate thing to do?' "They were unanimous in their reply and said: 'Yes, absolutely, you should, you must, because there's an incredible amount of support out there for people who survive these crimes.'" He added he was also keen for Colman and Tennant's characters - DS Ellie Miller and DI Alec Hardy - to show exemplary behaviour when dealing with the case. "I noticed Dorset Police put out a statement the other day in response to the programme saying 'If you report [a rape] you will be believed by police', so we wanted to show best practice by these extraordinary people that we'd met," Chibnall said. Chibnall's next job will be taking over the reins at Doctor Who, after Steven Moffat announced he would be leaving the programme. The last series of the show to star Peter Capaldi as the Doctor began on BBC One on Saturday, with the opening episode attracting an average of 4.6 million viewers. But Chibnall was reluctant to give too much away about what he has planned for the show when he takes over. "It's way too early to talk about Doctor Who. There's still an amazing series to go out with Peter Capaldi," he said. "I've been thinking about it for a long time and we're putting a team together. But for another year there is an amazing Doctor, there's an amazing showrunner in Steven Moffatt and I've read the scripts for this series and they are phenomenal."

It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities. It works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as in nightclubs and parks. The method has already been adopted by Western Cape in South Africa and Milwaukee in the USA. The man behind it, Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's School of Dentistry, said there was no reason it could not work anywhere in the world. One of the most significant breakthroughs was the sharing of information and joint action by police, councils and emergency departments to try to curb violence. Every time someone comes through accident and emergency with any sort of injury where alcohol is a contributory factor the police are informed. It is claimed that the approach has reduced hospital admissions for violence by 42% in Cardiff, relative to 13 similar cities in Wales and England. More than 100 hospitals across Wales and England have since copied Cardiff. "It's very low tech and the basic requirements are that the police and local government and health meet from time to time in an organised way," Prof Shepherd said. "That's not rocket science, so we think this is applicable widely, including poor countries [and] low and middle income countries. "We would very much like to see this implemented in a country like Nigeria, Uganda or South American countries where there's a lot of violence. "It's in the World Health Organisation-recommended approach but it's easier said than done." Prof Shepherd, who was a surgeon at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, started his work in 1996 after realising that a great deal of violence which resulted in hospital treatment was not known to the police because victims did not report it. He also noticed trends in the types of facial injuries he was treating. Patients were being regularly admitted who had been glassed, and one early success was putting pressure on clubs and city centre pubs to adopt plastic glasses. The move brought about an immediate decline in facial injuries connected to alcohol. However, there were continuing problems with drink-related crimes in the city so Prof Shepherd and his violence and society research group continued their innovative approach. The research group's research into violence, alcohol and late-night safety was recognised with a Queen's Anniversary Prize for excellence in higher education in 2009. Amsterdam decided to adopt the approach after a delegation from the city, including the chief inspector of the police force, visited Cardiff last year. Hidde Toet, from the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute and who led the delegation, said after the visit: "The Cardiff model provides us with an effective method to improve the way we share information and implement preventative measures by police and local government to effectively reduce violence."	The Dutch capital Amsterdam is following in the footsteps of Cardiff in a bid to reduce violent behaviour.
The prime minister faced cries of "coward" and "shame on you". One woman wept, saying it was because the PM declined to speak to anyone outside the meeting which lasted less than hour. Mrs May pledged £5m of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. "The package of support I'm announcing today is to give the victims the immediate support they need to care for themselves and for loved ones. We will continue to look at what more needs to be done," Mrs May said in a statement issued by her office. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance of St Clement's church and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister spent almost an hour speaking to patients and staff at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. It came a day after she faced criticism for meeting firefighters but not residents at the scene of the blaze. She also chaired the government's Civil Contingencies Committee, which deals with major crises such as terrorism or natural disasters, in Whitehall. But local people have contrasted the style of Mrs May's private visit to the scene with those of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was seen with his arm around the shoulders of people affected by the disaster. Also on Friday, the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge met volunteers, local residents and community representatives while visiting Westway Sports Centre, near the tower block in north Kensington. During interview with the BBC, Mrs May sidestepped questions over her response to the disaster. Pressed on whether she had failed to understand the anger felt by the community, she said: "This was a terrible tragedy that took place. People have lost their lives and others have lost everything, all their possessions, their home and everything. "What we are doing is putting in place the support that will help them." She said she had worked to ensure public services had the support they needed in order to be able to deal with the immediate aftermath. Conservative former Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said Mrs May should have been prepared to face residents' anger. He told BBC's This Week: "Alas Mrs May was what she has been for the last five or six weeks, that is to say she wanted an entirely controlled situation in which she didn't use her humanity. "She met in private with the emergency services, a good thing to do no doubt, but she should have been there with the residents, which is what Jeremy Corbyn was." But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who also faced some anger when she visited a community centre in the area on Friday, insisted that Mrs May was "absolutely heartbroken" by the blaze and was simply trying to make sure the government did everything it could to deal with its aftermath. Mrs Leadsom said: "In reality, every single member of the House of Commons, every member of the government from the prime minister downwards are absolutely horrified by what's happened and we are all trying to do the best we can. "I don't really think it is appropriate to be talking about whether people have humanity or not." As she spoke to Sky News at the site in west London, she was confronted by a local resident, who said opportunities had been missed to make the 24-storey block safe following a report into the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, south London. "Why are Sadiq Khan and Corbyn coming down here to speak to people and Theresa May is coming here with police, walking around, not meeting no-one, not meeting families?" the man said. "This fire could have been stopped a long, long time ago... There's not even sprinklers in there. "In 2009, the last block was on fire. What has changed since then? Nothing. Enough is enough, I have got friends in that tower. I have a right to be angry. Because of people saving money, people are dying." Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said it was "not OK" for the prime minister to go to the area but not meet residents, and called on her to invite them to talk to her in Downing Street, as victims of the 2009 Lakanal House fire had been. But on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood said there were "security reasons" why Mrs May had not met residents. And former housing minister Mark Prisk said Mrs May would not have wanted "to bring the whole weight of the media circus down on families who are going through some pretty grim days". But BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said there would be questions about why the Queen was able to make such a visit, and the prime minister was not. Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit on Thursday had been made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. On Friday, Mrs May visited the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital which is treating eight people, three of whom are in critical care. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC on Friday there would be immediate action following early conclusions from an investigative report into the fire. "We need to do whatever it takes to make people that live in those properties safe: that's either make the properties safe or find some other accommodation, it has to be done," Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "In this country, in this century, for this kind of thing to happen it is horrific and we cannot allow anything like this to ever happen again." Councils say they are carrying out urgent reviews of high-rise buildings in their areas in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. The chairman of the Local Government Association, which represent about 150 councils in England, said councils were reviewing fire risk assessments and the construction of buildings along with partners.	A large police presence held back angry crowds outside a Kensington church where Theresa May was meeting victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
Sixty patrol boats will protect the UK's two new aircraft carriers which are due to arrive at Portsmouth Naval Base in 2017. The first carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is expected to be operational in 2020. "We are going to see a bigger Royal Navy and the flagship... will be here in Portsmouth," Michael Fallon said. The 60 Pacific 24 rigid-hulled inflatable boats will be built by BAE systems to "guard the carriers in the harbour and our new frigates and destroyers", Mr Fallon said. He said they will also enhance security by providing a rapid response in rescue, anti-piracy and counter-narcotics missions in the area. Mr Fallon said: "Through the defence review, defence spending is going to go up every April for the rest of this parliament. He said as part of the larger investment, the government will also be able to provide the new aircraft carriers with sufficient fighter jets. "We have said we will maintain a minimum fleet of 19 destroyers and frigates, but as the older frigates are retired we also hope to add a lighter frigate between the offshore patrol vessel and Type 26 and to build more of those as well." Mr Fallon's visit to Portsmouth Naval Base comes as work has begun to rebuild the jetty for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2017. Floating cranes are also dredging Portsmouth harbour to prepare deeper channels for the aircraft carriers to sail from the base, which are the largest ships ever built for the Royal Navy. "This is a huge financial investment in making sure the channel is wide enough, in enlarging the jetty here so they can take the carriers and in making sure the carriers are properly guarded," Mr Fallon said. Taller than Nelson's Column and longer than Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower laid on its side, the new carriers will displace 65,000 tonnes of water. To make room for the carriers three million cubic metres of clay, sand and gravel will be removed from a two-mile stretch of Portsmouth Harbour covering an area the size of 200 football pitches.	Increased spending will result in a "bigger" Royal Navy, the defence secretary has said, as he announced a new £13.5m shipbuilding contract.
Edinburgh will also provide the venue for the European Challenge Cup the same year, but the host stadium has yet to be chosen for that event. European Professional Club Rugby announced the decision in Geneva ahead of next season's competition draws. France will host the 2016 finals, with both being played at the new Grand Stade de Lyon over one weekend. The Edinburgh finals will also take place over the same weekend. Scottish Rugby director of commercial operations, communications and public affairs Dominic McKay said: "It is a real endorsement of the work Scottish Rugby and its partners have achieved and will create a fantastic sporting weekend in Edinburgh and bring fans to the city from across Europe. "We have a great track record of putting on world-class events, including the highly successful hosting of the previous European Cup finals in 2005 and 2009 at BT Murrayfield, and this award will give us a further chance to showcase the passion for rugby and international sport here in Scotland." The Scottish Government and Event Scotland assisted the Edinburgh bid and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "After what has been quite a successful season for rugby in Scotland with Glasgow being crowned Pro12 champions and Edinburgh reaching the final of the European Challenge Cup, this announcement will keep the feel-good factor in the game going." Clubs finishing highest in the Celtic, English and French leagues qualify for the Champions Cup, while the others take part in the Challenge Cup. Edinburgh were beaten by Gloucester in last season's Challenge Cup final, hosted by Harlequins at the Stoop, while Twickenham was the venue for the Champions Cup final in which Toulon defeated French rivals Clermont Auvergne. Next season's Challenge Cup final will be played in Lyon on Friday 13 May, while the final of the Champions Cup will take place the next day. European Rugby said it had chosen the 2017 host city now to give organisers greater preparation time. President Simon Halliday said: "We received an extremely interesting also from the Scottish Rugby and we wanted to recognise choosing the renowned city of Edinburgh for the finals of 2017." The news was welcomed by Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend. "It's more than just a one-off game now with the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup played in the same city on the same weekend," he said. "With the quality of players in both tournaments, it's the highest level of club rugby, certainly in Europe if not in the world, so it'll be one of those must-see events. "It's great for Scottish rugby that it's going to take place in Edinburgh."	Murrayfield Stadium has been chosen to host the 2017 European Champions Cup final in May of that year.
Midfielder McClean and goalkeepers Randolph and Doyle have linked up with the squad after a three-day training camp in Fota Island near Cork. McClean and and Randolph will add experience to a 19-man squad. The game is followed by a friendly with Uruguay on 4 June and World Cup qualifier against Austria a week later. Republic boss Martin O'Neill named a 37-strong panel for the three matches a fortnight ago and a selection of senior players will report for duty after the trip to the United States. West Ham teenager Declan Rice was called up by O'Neill last week but he has dropped out following the training camp. Burnley defender Kevin Long and Preston midfielder Alan Browne could make their Republic debuts against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, Shane Duffy and Eunan O'Kane escaped injury in a road collision as they travelled to meet up with the squad on Sunday. Brighton defender Duffy and Leeds midfielder O'Kane were en route to the team hotel when their vehicle was involved in the accident.

BP described the withdrawal as a "precautionary measure", adding that it would monitor the security situation. The Foreign Office withdrew British embassy staff from the capital, Tripoli, last week. Gunmen have besieged the justice and foreign ministries recently, demanding that Gaddafi-era officials be expelled. The gunmen blocked the buildings two weeks ago, parking pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns outside. The siege was lifted by Sunday and employees at both ministries were back at work. Parliament passed a law last week barring Gaddafi-era officials from political office. BP said in a statement: "Following FCO advice given to us by the British Embassy in Tripoli, and purely as a precautionary measure, we have brought non-essential overseas staff out of Libya for the time being in a phased reduction of numbers. "Our Libyan staff remain and the office continues to operate. Fewer than a dozen people are affected. "We will continue to monitor the security situation and move people back in to Libya when it is considered safe to do so." On Friday, the Foreign Office said some embassy staff in Libya had been withdrawn in response to "ongoing political uncertainty". It said it was temporarily withdrawing a "small number" who work with Libyan ministries, while the UK embassy remains "open as usual", including for consular and visa services. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli and against all travel to other parts of Libya, such as the eastern city of Benghazi.	Oil giant BP has withdrawn some non-essential staff from operations in Libya following UK government advice about uncertainty in the country.

The 27-year-old was substituted after just 15 minutes in the Hammers' 3-1 win at Bournemouth. Carroll had scored two goals in West Ham's past four games after returning to action in September 2015, following seven months out for knee surgery. "He's a positive lad, but of course he is gutted for several reasons," said Hammers boss Slaven Bilic. "He felt he was back and enjoying his football. "It's not the end of the world, though. If everything goes well he will be back very soon so there is no reason to be negative. "If it goes as we expect, then he will be back for a significant part of the season, the last 10-15 games, with enough time to make a huge impact on our season." A former Newcastle player, Carroll joined West Ham from Liverpool for a club record £15m in June 2013. Carroll has won nine England caps and scored twice but has not played for the national team since a World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2012. West Ham are fifth in the Premier League, just a point behind fourth-placed Tottenham with 17 games remaining.	West Ham striker Andy Carroll is facing up to six weeks out of action with a hamstring injury.
Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton, 30, won a thrilling United States Grand Prix to seal the drivers' title with his 10th victory of 2015. He pressured team-mate Nico Rosberg into a mistake during a frantic last 10 laps after a safety car and swept by. It was an exciting climax to a race of fluctuating fortunes, lead changes and superb racing in changing conditions. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel could have kept the race open until Mexico next weekend had he finished second, but could manage only third place behind Rosberg. "Amazing," Hamilton told singer Elton John during the podium interviews. "I can't find the right words to tell you how amazing this feels. "I love you guys and everything you do for me. For all my family, I love you all." Rosberg's error came a lap after a restart following one of two safety car periods in a race that also featured two interruptions by the virtual safety car. Media playback is not supported on this device Before that, the advantage had continuously swung back and forwards between the two Mercedes drivers in a race of fluctuating fortunes. With 15 laps to go, it appeared as if Hamilton was going to miss out, as he led the race but appeared a sitting duck with Rosberg on fresher tyres and closing in behind after stopping under a virtual safety car period while Hamilton stayed out. But then a heavy crash for Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat when the Russian lost control at Turn 19 gave Hamilton a lifeline when the actual safety car was deployed. He stopped for fresh tyres and rejoined in second place, right behind Rosberg, and the two were set up for an all-out battle for victory in the closing 10 laps. Now Hamilton had the advantage, on tyres eight laps fresher, and on lap 48 of 56 Rosberg lost traction out of the Turn 12 hairpin at the end of the long back straight, his car flicked from side to side and he ran wide off the track as Hamilton swept into the lead. The German tried to come back at Hamilton but the Englishman held him comfortably at bay. Hamilton was told he had won the title over the radio on his slowing down lap and initially struggled to speak, apparently fighting back tears, before managing to thank the team and his family for their support. He then performed donut spins for the fans in the stadium section towards the end of the lap before touring back to the pits for the ceremonies. Hamilton's team-mate Rosberg congratulated the Briton as they prepared for the podium interviews, but then appeared furious when Hamilton tossed a 'second place' cap towards the German, who then launched it back toward the champion. Rosberg said: "It has never happened to me ever something like that [the error], I can't explain it. I just need to look into it afterwards. It was really tough at the time to lose the lead like that and the win. "Turn One for sure was very aggressive [by Hamilton]. I haven't seen it so I can't comment until I have seen it. Extremely aggressive and we hit each other. Or I should say Lewis came into me, so that's not good. I can't say more than that." The race started on a wet track but with the sun finally breaking through after a weekend badly affected by rain on the periphery of tropical storm Patricia, which had forced qualifying to be held on Sunday morning. Hamilton immediately put himself in a position to win the title, making a better start from second on the grid behind Rosberg and taking the lead at the first corner, forcing his team-mate wide in the process and giving the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo the chance to demote Rosberg to fourth. On a wet track on treaded intermediate tyres, the Red Bulls were faster than the Mercedes and Hamilton faced an initial attack from Kvyat. The top four were locked together for the first 19 laps as Rosberg moved into second, only for Ricciardo to pass him and then Hamilton to take the lead. Media playback is not supported on this device But once the track began to fully dry, the Red Bulls lacked the pace to challenge and dropped back and the race developed into a battle between the two Mercedes drivers. Hamilton initially struggled as Rosberg, driving what for a while looked set to be the best race of his career, took control. Hamilton began to push Rosberg hard after the first safety car period to recover a stranded car in the middle of the race, only for the virtual safety car to hand Rosberg what appeared as if it might be a decisive advantage. Rosberg pitted for fresh tyres just as the brief caution was poised to end and came out behind Vettel but on fresh tyres and with an apparently strong advantage. But then Kvyat's crash added a final twist and Hamilton sealed a title for which he has appeared on course since the very beginning of the season.

New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall. Mr Swinney said the stats were "good news" in light of recruitment "challenges" in some areas. Opposition parties said numbers were still down over the long term. And they said parents "have a right to be very angry" about the attainment gap between pupils from better and worse-off backgrounds. The latest figures showed teacher numbers were up for the first time in several years, with 51,000 employed in state schools in 2016. But in 12 local authorities the numbers fell, with the largest percentage drop in Moray, which has highlighted recruitment problems in the past. The figures were among a fresh batch of important statistics being published on the state of the Scottish education system. The ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained across Scotland but the average size of a class crept up slightly to 23.5 students. Nationally, the number of teachers fell between 2010 and 2014 then stabilised. The number of teachers fell in 12 council areas, including in Highland and Dumfries and Galloway, although in both these regions the ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained at the same level. In 12 council areas the ratio of pupils to teachers got worse in 2016, including in Edinburgh and Fife where teacher numbers had risen. These were: The government expects the ratio of pupils to teachers to be maintained, although BBC Scotland understands the councils will not face any financial sanctions. Many councils have told BBC Scotland that they are finding it hard to fill some vacancies. Recently the Scottish government unveiled a number of initiatives to try to encourage more people into teaching, and some local authorities have also launched their own initiatives. The latest statistics also showed: Separate figures, published on Tuesday, looked at the number of children considered by teachers to be performing at the required level for their age in Curriculum for Excellence. The data showed that between 65% and 85% of pupils in primary schools achieved the relevant level in aspects of literacy and numeracy. However, the proportion of pupils achieving the relevant level for their stage decreased throughout the primary stages. Updating MSPs on the figures, Mr Swinney said: "I very much welcome the rise in teacher numbers compared to last year, the fact that class sizes are broadly stable and that the pupil-teacher ratio has been maintained. "This is all good news, particularly when you consider the teacher recruitment challenges being faced in some areas. "The data shows that significant improvements are required in some local authorities, and real challenges exist in delivering the progress in literacy and numeracy we seek. "There is much to be proud of in Scottish education; we need to remain focused on and committed to Curriculum for Excellence and we need to continue to implement the reforms we are putting in place." Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, welcomed the rise in teacher numbers but said some "significant challenges" continued to face schools. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The number of teachers employed across Scotland has held steady, and actually shows a small increase overall, indicating the local authorities have adhered to a commitment brokered between the EIS and local and national government to maintain teacher numbers over the year. "This is very welcome, and is helping to improve employment prospects for qualified teachers and ensure that young people have consistent levels of provision in schools across Scotland. "The EIS would certainly expect the Scottish government to continue its commitment to maintaining teacher numbers, and we hope to hear confirmation soon from the finance minister in his forthcoming financial statement." He added: "Given the welcome Scottish government commitment to tackling the attainment gap, the trend of rising class sizes is an issue that must be tackled through greater investment in a greater number of qualified teachers." The Scottish Conservatives said teacher numbers were still thousands below the levels they were at in 2007. The party's education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: "With teacher numbers having plummeted from the levels they were at a decade ago, it once again calls into question whether the CfE can be delivered properly. "There are a number of legitimate concerns about the curriculum, and these statistics are further evidence that we need to have proper independent scrutiny of how it is being implemented." Ms Smith also told Mr Swinney that parents "have a right to be very angry" about the gulf in achievement between pupils from differing financial circumstances. The Scottish Greens' education spokesman Ross Greer questioned the government's decision to publish statistics on how well schools pupils were doing in certain areas of the Curriculum for Excellence. He said: "Today's figures demonstrate the utterly bizarre education priorities the Scottish government has. We see class sizes continue to creep up, making them the highest they've been since the SNP formed the government and nine years after they promised to reduce them to 18. "More teachers and smaller classes are vital if we're to improve the quality of education." Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP of "slashing" spending on Scotland's school pupils by more than 8%. She highlighted analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) which she said showed that real-terms spend on education fell from Â£6,692-per-pupil in 2010/11 to Â£6,152 in 2014-15. She said: "Nicola Sturgeon promised to make education her top priority, but Scotland has plunged down the international league tables on her watch. "Year-on-year cuts to school budgets, teacher numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland's children." Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott MSP said: "Today's figures show that after a decade in power, the SNP has failed to deliver on its commitment of smaller class sizes for our youngest pupils." The latest figures a week after it emerged that Scotland's schools had recorded their worst-ever performance in an international survey of pupils. The country's scores for maths, reading and science all declined in the latest set of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures. It was the first time since the tests began in 2000 that Scotland's performance in all three subject areas was classed as "average", with none "above average", among the 72 countries that took part. The Curriculum for Excellence has been introduced in Scottish schools in recent years, with the country's qualifications system also overhauled. However, teaching unions have complained about "excessive and unsustainable" workloads as a result of some of the changes.	Education Secretary John Swinney has welcomed an overall increase in teacher numbers in Scotland - although he said "significant improvements" were needed in some areas.
It was believed the Irish Army had removed all the wreckage at the time but a group of aviation historians and Queens University Belfast archaeologists thought otherwise. After ground surveys pointed to parts being present just four meters below the surface, a number of items were excavated on Saturday. These included the cockpit door. The pilot - Gordon Hayter Proctor - had safely bailed out of the plane on the northern side of the border after his instruments froze. It glided on before crashing in a field in Figullar, Emyvale, on 20 November 1942. The plane, which had seen action in the Battle of Britain, was considered "war-weary" and had been assigned to a weather-monitoring squadron operating out of RAF Aldergrove in Antrim in 1942. Project organiser Jonny McNee told the BBC the dig had "exceeded expectations" and they had recovered "Monaghan's Battle of Britain forgotten heritage". The aviation historian said they had unearthed internal parts of the Rolls Royce engine and plates inscribed with information, such as manufacturing details. "The cockpit door was a bit of a surprise," he said. "The last person to use it was Flt Lt Gordon Hayter Proctor who was later declared missing while serving in Burma. "He has no grave and now he will be remembered in a bit of Monaghan. The display will be homage to him". He added that the team would love to make contact with any of his family members. Mr McNee said they knew more than 90% of the plane had been taken away at the time and probably scrapped. "We had done our research and by looking at the Irish Army military archives, we knew that a substantial amount of the plane was taken away," he said. "Back in September we applied for and were granted a licence to use ground-penetrating radar which detected the impact crater and showed sizable metallic remains." Pupils from three schools - two in Monaghan and one in County Londonderry, had been invited to help out at the dig, which also attracted the attention of many locals. Josie McCusker, who remembers seeing the Spitfire fall from the sky all those years ago, stayed for the entire duration of the dig. "It was the morning, a Sunday morning and I remember the loud noise of it," she told BBC Radio Ulster. "My father was milking cows in the byre and he heard the noise and he ran into the house thinking it was on fire. "We then discovered it was a plane - it took the tops off the trees and a piece of it fell down in a gooseberry bush behind the house. "I remember much of the plane being removed by the Army, and remember seeing it on a lorry." The job now is to clean, sort, identify and catalogue the items before handing them to the County Monaghan Museum, which will then be able to claim it has artefacts from the only Battle of Britain Spitfire to be legally excavated in Ireland.	Remnants from an RAF Spitfire plane which crashed into a field in County Monaghan in 1942 have been recovered.
The 32-year-old right-back has been with Arsenal since the age of eight and has won nine league titles during her time at the club. Coach Pedro Martinez Losa said: "We are very pleased that Alex has signed a new contract with us. Alex is a true leader who brings so much to our team. "She shows professionalism on and off the pitch, providing a great role model for our younger players to look up to."	England defender Alex Scott has signed a new contract with Arsenal Ladies.
Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: "I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. "It is a disappointment that is widespread." A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was "a political problem". "We are not going to lie down and accept it," she said. "We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases." Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that "action can be taken as soon as possible". "Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner," he said. "This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits." A Department of Justice spokesman said: "Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. "There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners."	An inquest into an IRA massacre of 10 Protestant workers has been delayed because there is no coroner to hear it.
The NI Composite Economic Index (NICEI) showed growth of 0.3% when compared to the first quarter of the year. Compared to the same period in 2013 the economy has grown by 1.2% The growth is being driven by the services and manufacturing industries while construction output is still falling. Meanwhile, the labour market is continuing to improve with the number of people claiming jobseekers allowance down again in September. The number of claimants was down by 300 to 52,000 - over the last year the number has fallen by  9,400. The quarterly unemployment rate also showed a fall - it was down by  0.5 percentage points for the period June to August 2014 bringing it to 6.1%. That is the lowest quarterly rate since December to February 2009. Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster described the economic data as "encouraging". She said the number of unemployment claimants had now been falling for 21 months, the most sustained decrease since June 1995. She said the NICEI  "also shows evidence of growth in real terms over both the quarter and the year up to quarter two".	Northern Ireland's economy grew slightly in the second quarter of this year, according to the latest official figures.
Craig Peacock fired the hosts into a ninth minute lead but Manchester hit back three minutes later courtesy of Vinny Scarsella's breakaway goal.

Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said Christians were the most persecuted people, but few of them would receive sanctuary in the UK. The government has said 20,000 refugees will be brought to Britain directly from refugee camps around Syria. But Cardinal Nichols said most Christians did not go into the camps. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today, Archbishop Nichols said: "I can see the point in going directly to the refugee camps, but in fact I think its unintended consequence will be that there will be few, if any, Christians coming to this country. "That is because for the most part Christian refugees do not go into the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) camps. They go to fellow Christian organisations." He added: "If we are going to deal purely with UNHCR according to their rules, then there can be no preference given to anybody on behalf of their faith and we will simply bypass the Christian refugees, not intentionally but in fact." It comes as the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, will say that Britain has lost its sense of proportion in relation to the refugee crisis. In his Christmas sermon at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff he is expected to say that the "debate seems to be centred on how many refugees we should accept. We forget to ask, or perhaps we choose to forget, why there are so many refugees in the first place". The refugees being brought to the UK will be drawn from established refugee camps, initially as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme. More than 50 local authorities have taken a share of those who have already arrived. Alongside the VPR scheme, the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	Christian refugees fleeing Syria are being bypassed by the UK government, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said.
Dan Groves said the "finer points" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released. The Sun reported that the 30-year-old will become a club director. Billericay are eighth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, three points adrift of a play-off place. Wright, who was runner-up in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2011, played non-league football for a succession of clubs, including Lewes, Crawley Town and Rushden & Diamonds. Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was "comfortable" investing £10,000 a week. The club signed former England international Paul Konchesky, 35, at the start of March.	The chairman of non-league Billericay Town has confirmed "there is truth" in reports that former The Only Way is Essex personality Mark Wright is set to invest in the club.
Media playback is not supported on this device Webber led after the final pit stops and the drivers were told to hold position to the end of the race but Vettel passed Webber after a tussle with 13 laps to go. Vettel has since apologised for the incident. Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton took third ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who obeyed an order to stay behind. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing. The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed. Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel. The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th. It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live. "The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. "It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix. "Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy. "Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him. "The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers. "In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix." The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop. Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being "silly" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line. Webber said: "After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual." Vettel was told over the radio after the race: "Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do." Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start. He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders. Vettel chose to end the race on the softer 'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard. Vettel said: "Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally." Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had "got out of control". Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps. Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told "negative" by team boss Ross Brawn. When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being "controlled" and could also go faster. Hamilton admitted on the podium: "I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here." Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes. "I did a Jenson," he said. "He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team." The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012. Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two. It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts. He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits. Alonso wrote later on Twitter: "Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race." Result: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger), Red Bull, 1hr 38min 56.681secs 2.

The system is being based on the way people fill up their car with petrol or buy data bundles with a mobile phone. The company says it is an attempt to simplify energy bills. ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: "We're saying to people buy it by the day, not by kilowatts or a fancy tariff you don't understand." Customers will use an app that has a gauge measuring consumption. The company will tailor each customer's "day" based on a personalised forecast of how much energy they typically use. This will also vary according to the time of year. Customers will be able to buy packages of gas and electricity in quantities from one day to a month, and up to 180 days ahead. The firm has been piloting the scheme and it says it could transform the way consumers buy energy. Mr Anderson said they went back to scratch and looked at how people bought petrol for their car. "You go to the garage and put Â£50 in your car. Inherently you know that will last you two to three weeks. "We thought why don't we do the same thing with energy." A fuel gauge supplied within the app will then tell customers how much energy they are using and how much they have left. Under the scheme, called "PowerUp", customers will not have to pay a standing charge. Scottish Power said its tariffs for the scheme would include some of the firm's most competitive prices. It will be launched to existing customers initially, and the company firm will then consider whether to open it up to the wider market. A two-year investigation into the energy industry by the competition authorities found that many consumers were not engaged in the energy market and failed to switch to the cheapest deals. The new approach to buying energy has been welcomed by the industry regulator. In a statement, Ofgem said: "We want more competition to increase choice and drive down prices for consumers. "We encourage suppliers to offer new innovative tariffs to help people engage in the market and find the best deal which suits them. "Innovative tariffs can be tailored to an individual consumer's needs and give people more control over their energy bill and how they pay for it." Claire Osborne, energy expert for Uswitch.com said: "Energy bills are notoriously difficult to understand and so this approach, similar to how we buy petrol, should help consumers use less, waste less and pay less for their gas and electricity. "The fact that the deal has no standing charge will be attractive to many customers - particularly those with second homes which are unoccupied for part of the year - as there's nothing to pay on days when no energy is used."	ScottishPower customers will soon be able to buy gas and electricity in bundles of days rather than signing up to standard or fixed-price deals.
Fr D'Arcy was responding to a BBC This World programme which found that the cardinal failed to pass details of sex abuse to police or parents. It said that in 1975, Cardinal Brady had the names and address of children being abused by Fr Brendan Smyth. Smyth, a paedophile, continued to attack children for a further 13 years. Cardinal Brady claimed the BBC exaggerated his authority at that time. He said he had "absolutely no authority over Smyth" and had felt betrayed that those in the Church who had the power to stop Smyth did not do so. In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on Thursday, Father D'Arcy said he would find it hard to continue if he was in the position of the current Irish Church leader. But he added that changing the cardinal would not necessarily mean a fresh start. "The bottom line is that if Cardinal Brady goes, the ordinary  people of Ireland won't have a single vote on who replaces him. That is the problem," he said. "Actually he would have to offer his resignation and if the Vatican didn't take it he would be back to square one. "Some people think that is what happened two years ago. But the Vatican was saying no." Father Eamon Murray, who is originally from Northern Ireland but now based in England, said many priests feel demoralised by clerical child abuse. He said Cardinal Brady would have do do a "lot of soul searching". "If I was in that position, I would have gone a long time ago because it's your own moral credibility that has suffered," he told the BBC's Nolan Show. "I've listened to a lot of people and naturally people are angry at the church and rightly so and I feel that anger and I feel that hurt and pain. "It pains me to see people who have practised their faith for a long, long time, many years leaving the church as a result of losing credibility in hierarchy." Meanwhile, one of Smyth's victims has called for the cardinal's resignation. Brendan Boland said he thought Cardinal Brady's refusal to resign was wrong. "I can't understand why he can't see his failings," he said. "For him to stand without resigning I think that is further abuse of me. "Resign. Own up to your failings." In 1975, Cardinal Brady was a priest and teacher in County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland, when he was sent by his bishop to investigate a claim of child sexual abuse by a fellow priest. That priest was later exposed as Smyth, who died in prison in 1997, one month into a 12-year prison sentence. The first child to tell his parents about the abuse was the then 14-year-old Brendan Boland. Speaking on Wednesday, Cardinal Brady said in a             statement : "With others, I feel betrayed that those who had the authority in the Church to stop Brendan Smyth failed to act on the evidence I gave them. "However, I also accept that I was part of an unhelpful culture of deference and silence in society, and the Church, which thankfully is now a thing of the past." The cardinal said he was "shocked, appalled and outraged" by Smyth and said he had trusted that those with the authority to act in relation to Smyth would treat the evidence seriously and respond appropriately. "The commentary in the programme and much of the coverage of my role in this inquiry gives the impression that I was the only person who knew of the allegations against Brendan Smyth at that time and that because of the office I hold in the Church today I somehow had the power to stop Brendan Smyth in 1975. "I had absolutely no authority over Brendan Smyth. Even my Bishop had limited authority over him. The only people who had authority within the Church to stop Brendan Smyth from having contact with children were his Abbot in the Monastery in Kilnacrott and his Religious Superiors in the Norbertine Order." Police are also studying the documentary. A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: "The PSNI will study the content of this programme. We can make no further comment at this time."	Irish priest Father Brian D'Arcy has said he believes Cardinal Sean Brady was willing to offer his resignation two years ago but the Vatican refused.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a  new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay. The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour. The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month. The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink. Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents. Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept. Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised. He said: "I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles. "The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage." Serco Northlink was awarded the six-year Â£243m Northern Isles contract in 2012. It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government.	An agreement has been reached to ensure foreign workers on freight boats serving Orkney and Shetland are paid at least the minimum wage.
Eight of the accused, all senior managers, are charged with murder over the Soma coalmine tragedy in western Turkey last year. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday because the court said the accused must testify in person, not via video link. An underground fire sent deadly carbon monoxide through the mine. An inquiry criticised the mine's safety measures. It was modern Turkey's worst industrial accident. The trial at Akhisar, about 50km (30 miles) from Soma, drew several hundred angry relatives to the special tribunal, but police prevented them from getting in. The BBC's Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen says the government is shielding state officials from any investigation, despite claims that they were aware of safety deficiencies at the mine but failed to act. The managers facing murder charges could be given up to 25 years in prison. Protests broke out after last year's disaster, fuelled by an apparently insensitive comment by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister at the time. He said accidents were "in the nature of the business". The International Labour Organisation says Turkey has the third-highest rate of workplace accidents in the world.	Turkey has begun the trial of 45 managers and employees charged over a mine disaster which killed 301 people.
The naked man was spotted outside his hotel on Chorlton Street, at about 04:30 BST. Greater Manchester Police said it was a "genuine case of sleepwalking". GMP tweeted: "We checked with officers; was proper somnambulism, not a dare. Person grateful for our help + saw the funny side themselves." The man's identity has not been revealed by police.	A man was helped back to his hotel after sleepwalking into the street in Manchester city centre without any clothes on, police have said.
Derek Mackay told the BBC that "as it stands" the work should be finished in early January. The bridge was completely closed on Friday and alternative travel plans have been put in place. Extra trains between Fife and Edinburgh have been laid on and 11,000 park and ride spaces made available. Follow our Scotland Live page for regular updates Why is the Forth Road Bridge closed? The troubles of the Forth Road Bridge Firms warn of bridge closure costs The trains were very busy on Monday morning with increased queuing at Inverkeithing station but there was plenty of room at the park and ride facilities. Mr Mackay told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "As it stands right now, we believe that if we remedy and repair the fault, strengthen that, the bridge should be operational and open to all traffic on completion of the repair as per the timetable that I had outlined over the weekend." The Scottish government believes that the urgent work should be completed by the end of the festive season. It is estimated that about 70,000 vehicles use the Forth Road Bridge each day and Friday saw 11-mile rush hour tailbacks on the first full day of its closure. A plan has been put in place to help ease travel problems: Mr Mackay insisted that the fault was not linked to a drop in finance because of the ending of bridge tolls in 2008. He said: "This is a fault, that we believe on expert advice, only happened in the last few weeks. "So on routine inspection, it was identified on Tuesday, expert engineering analysis studied that and inspected it fully, information went to ministers on Thursday evening, within minutes a decision was taken on advice on recommendation to close the bridge that evening." Mr Mackay added that the two reasons for closure were one, not to compromise safety, and second not further damage the structure of the bridge. Businesses are already feeling the impact of the repair work, including road hauliers. Martin Reid, the Scottish director of the Road Haulage Association, explained how relatively short journeys have doubled in length. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What we have established is that even the most basic journeys where you are moving from West Lothian into Central Fife - journeys that would normally take 40 to 50 minutes are now taking two to three hours. "There is on going costs to that, there are delays to service, additional costs attached to running idle when you are in traffic jams. It is having a massive effect there is no doubt about that - to be fair it is affecting everyone in the east of Scotland."	Urgent repairs on the Forth Road Bridge should be completed on time and the structure re-opened to all traffic, Scotland's transport minister has said.
Jo Deering died in 2011, aged 52,  just months after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Under-fire Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust admitted it could have made better decisions about her care. However, Ms Deering's sister, Maureen Rickman, said the trust's findings "deserved to be binned". In December, the BBC revealed that the trust, which provides services to about 45,000 people in Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, had failed to investigate hundreds of unexpected deaths since 2011. Ms Deering, from New Milton, Hampshire, had paranoid schizophrenia and was discharged from hospital two weeks after being sectioned. She was sent home where she was the main carer for her 89-year-old mother, who had dementia. Four months later she took her own life. Her family said the trust should not have allowed her to go home while she was still ill. In its 2012 report, the trust said the medical team based at Waterford House who cared for Ms Deering should "be commended for their ongoing efforts to work with Joanna and her whole family in as an inclusive a way as possible, despite significant complications". Ms Rickman said: "There isn't an investigation here, nothing of the sort. I could have carried out a better investigation myself to be quite frank." She added: "It deserves to be binned - nobody would have known anything from this at all, there is nothing to take away from this other than a load of psycho babble and twaddle." In a statement, Dr Lesley Stevens, medical director at the trust, said the report found its "decision-making process about granting leave, and how we communicated this with Jo and her family, could have been better". "Robust actions to learn from this incident were fully implemented at the time," she added. She said the trust had provided community support to help Ms Deering with her role as a carer. "The way we investigate and learn when things go wrong, has changed substantially," she added.	The family of a woman who killed herself after being discharged from hospital has labelled a report into her death "psycho babble and twaddle".
The US economy added 321,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said, well above analysts' forecasts of about 225,000 new jobs.

The group published its report on the government's draft budget, which marks the first use of new tax powers. Members said new powers combined with economic uncertainty caused by Brexit meant it was "critical" there was "complete transparency" over budgets. Holyrood's parties have so far failed to reach consensus over the plans. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he is "positive" about winning opposition support for the budget, but other party leaders have warned "it's not looking good" for a deal to be struck ahead of the Stage One vote on 2 February. The budget bill has now been formally published at Holyrood, marking the start of the formal legislative process. The final votes on the tax and spending proposals will be held before the end of February. Finance committee convener Bruce Crawford said he was pleased that the cross-party membership of the group had managed to come to a consensus and produce a largely unanimous report, despite the political disagreements over the budget. Summarising the report, he pointed to Holyrood's new fiscal powers introducing "a significant level of complexity to the budget process". He said: "It is clear to us the increased dependence of the budget on relative economic performance, combined with the complexity of the fiscal framework, means there is now a much greater degree of volatility and uncertainty in the budget process. "This uncertainty is exacerbated by the potential impact of Brexit on economic growth and the public finances." The report notes the "historic" nature of the budget, being the first time that Holyrood will set the rates and bands for income tax in Scotland. Members noted that this would be complex under normal circumstances, but added that "the added uncertainty arising from Brexit significantly increases the challenge" for the parliament and government in agreeing the budget. They said it was therefore "critical" that there was "sufficient transparency to ensure public confidence in the operation of the new financial powers". And they added that "significant work is required in developing a new budget process and wider financial scrutiny" given the added complexity and the reduced timescale for scrutiny in the current setup. Members also noted the "variety of sets of figures" being presented on local government and local services, which has been the root of a political row. Opposition parties have pointed to the core council budget going down, but the government insists other funds going directly to schools and health and social care partnerships means the budget for "local services" is increasing. In its budget report, Holyrood's local government committee said that "greater transparency is required" as "the budget for local government and the allocations to local authorities are very difficult to follow". The finance committee agreed with this, and called on the Scottish government to produce "detailed proposals" on making the state of local government finances more transparent. This was one of the few areas where the MSPs could not reach a consensus, with the report noting: "Due to the different presentation and sets of numbers relating to the local government settlement, some members were concerned about the level of financial resource available to local government in the settlement." Members also voiced disappointment that Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke had declined to give evidence to the committee over the operation of the fiscal framework, saying it was "vital" to hear from a Treasury minister during the budget process. The report also asks the Scottish government for additional information on a range of topics, including estimates of tax revenues and "a full and comprehensive analysis of the use of borrowing powers". Mr Mackay said he would consider the recommendations in the report "carefully", and provide a formal response before the end of the budget process. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said "we are not getting any reasonable proposals from the Conservatives or Labour", but Mr Mackay has said there is "room for manoeuvre" in talks with the Lib Dems and Greens. However, Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, who has asked for up to Â£400m of extra spending on mental health and education, warned that "it's not looking good" for a deal to be struck before the Stage One vote. And Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie, who is targeting tax changes, said there was no sign so far that the government had decided to compromise with any other party. He said debate would continue "in a constructive spirit", but said the ball was in the government's court. Mr Mackay said he would continue "constructive discussions" with other parties. The Scottish Conservatives said they would not back the budget, saying it would make Scotland "the highest-taxed part of the UK". And Scottish Labour said the government should "go back to the drawing board", saying they would "seek to amend the SNP's budget to stop the cuts".	Scotland faces "a much higher level of uncertainty and volatility" in its budgets due to new powers and Brexit, Holyrood's finance committee has said.
Pop Recs Ltd hosted in-store gigs by acts from Franz Ferdinand to James Bay. It also earned the group an award for Britain's hardest-working band from the Association of Independent Music. Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. "We need to be somewhere else," he said. "Not existing is not an option." The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it. Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks. But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists. It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups. Now, however, they have moved out after Sunderland City Council, which owned the building, sold it for student flats. Pulled Apart By Horses played the shop's final gig on Saturday. Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises, and that comments from the shop's regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen. Things like the poetry group, which has 40 members, and the Saturday morning "stitch and bitch", will "stop happening here", Harper said. "That's absolutely terrifying because, if you walk around this city, and if you don't want baked pastry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on, I don't know what people do. "I'm standing here with grease on my hands and I hadn't cried for years until I realised this place was done, and people were saying pleasant things about it. It's really driven home so acutely what this place has meant to people." Members of shop's the regular meetings have told him that the groups help with their mental health problems, he said. "They feel comfortable here and they don't feel comfortable anywhere else that's state sponsored or medication related," he said. "I didn't know we were doing this. "People have just come and told us recently, and that was infinitely more upsetting, yet satisfying, that we were achieving things we didn't even realise under our own noses." The band have always known the council was trying to sell the building, Sunderland City Council's cabinet secretary Councillor Mel Speding said. "That has now been secured with its development into student accommodation. "This is in line with council objectives to see more people living and working in the city centre and, in the interests of council tax payers in these financially challenging times for local authorities, it secures a capital receipt. "Naturally, with the success and popularity of Pop Recs, the council and others have been looking at ways and means of continuing and securing a similar venture elsewhere in the city centre."	A record shop opened by indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings in their home town of Sunderland two years ago has shut after the premises was sold.
Dr Henry McLaughlin believes that physical and mental wellbeing can be improved by a daily mountain climb. The idea is that people climb to the top of Slievemartin outside Rostrevor - known locally as the Cairn - take a selfie and then post the picture on the 'Cairnuary' Facebook page. The mountain is 485m high, so Dr McLaughlin said if you climb it 31 times in a month, you've climbed higher than Everest. He said he could see how his patients have benefitted. "January's a time when I see a lot of depression and this challenge is pretty good for mental health and physical health," Dr McLaughlin said. "A lot of people buy exercise bikes and then they gather dust. So this is something that's free, they get to climb up the mountain every day for a month. "It's a  good hard exercise, it takes them about an hour. "They don't need exercise bikes and they don't need to join gyms and pay money for stuff, it's out there and they can discover the mountains." Those climbing the mountain can chose their own route - which could involve anything up to a 10km hike - or they can use a bike if they want. Dr McLaughlin said between 30 to 50 people were now climbing the mountain daily and all sorts of people are taking part. "There's one lady who's a patient of mine who's been very ill in the past and has had surgeries to her feet and really shouldn't be able to do it, but she's going from the car park half way up the mountain and she's doing it every day," he said. "There's people with depression doing it - I know it's good for them - people who are overweight doing it, there are people who are very healthy doing it as well. "People are all very encouraging of each other." Dr McLaughlin said he climbed the mountain at about 06:00 GMT on Thursday and had eight other people for company. "Normally you'd climb the mountain at six o'clock in the morning and you wouldn't see a soul," he said. The final climb will be a communal one on Sunday, but Dr McLaughlin said he hoped to come up with something else to keep his patients exercising. "I'm hoping to follow it on with some sort of challenge for the rest of the year that will keep them doing stuff," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, it's probably doing my work good in that maybe some people are going to get fit that I won't see. "I'd recommend it to anybody. There could be a cairn near you, it doesn't have to be my cairn, it could be a hill or a mountain near you."	A County Down GP has come up with a novel, if strenuous, way to get healthy and beat the January blues.
It said just 8% of councils had built enough to replace half of their stock sold through the scheme, which allows council tenants to buy their homes. The charity said there was a danger of some areas having no affordable homes. The government said it was committed to building 275,000 affordable new homes over the course of this parliament. Right to Buy was first introduced in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government and was given a boost in 2012 when discounts for tenants were increased to Â£75,000. In this year's Queen's speech the government announced the scheme was being extended to 1.3m housing association tenants in England. Shelter, which looked at provisional figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government, said just two of the 166 councils in England listed as selling properties through Right to Buy had succeeded in replacing more than 100% of the properties sold. Under existing policy, the government has promised that each home sold after 2012 would be replaced. The charity's chief executive Campbell Robb warned the problem of not enough council homes being replaced was only likely to get worse, leaving some areas with no affordable homes. "At this rate they'll soon be black-spots across the country where no-one on a normal income can afford to live," he said. 1. North Kesteven 187% 2. New Forest 128% 3. Waverley 89% 4. Barking and Dagenham 88% 5. Winchester 81% 6. Ipswich 80% 7. Tandridge 79% 8. Castle Point 71% 9. Hounslow 64% 10. South Cambridgeshire 59% The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, said many council housing programmes were hampered by complex rules and restrictions on the use of receipts from sales of homes. LGA housing spokesman Peter Box said: "It is imperative that councils are given the powers to replace housing sold through Right to Buy quickly and effectively as part of the Spending Review. "Councils need to be able to retain 100% of receipts from sales while Right to Buy discounts should be set locally so they reflect the cost of houses in the area." Mr Box said the LGA estimated this would allow councils to replace 50,000 homes sold over the lifetime of the next Parliament. The government said nearly 40,000 new homeowners had been created since it increased discounts for council tenants in 2012. A spokesman added: "Councils are continuing to fulfil the requirement to deliver one for one replacements within three years, and over 3,000 replacement homes have already been delivered across England. "We have been absolutely clear that if councils do not deliver one for one replacements for the additional homes sold under Right to Buy the government will."	One in three councils in England has not replaced a single home sold through the Right to Buy scheme since 2012, according to the charity Shelter.
Damage to to overhead wires meant the line is blocked north of Morpeth. Virgin East Coast, Northern Rail, and Cross Country services were affected, with reports of large queues at Newcastle Central Station. Buses were organised to take passengers between Newcastle and Edinburgh, with people advised to avoid travelling if possible. Services resumed late on Friday.	Rail passengers travelling between Newcastle and Scotland faced severe disruption on Friday.
The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the "full English" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not "feel cheated" and had been "very lucky" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been "a giant among journalists" and the "heart and soul" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: "It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. "Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all." He added: "He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. "Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him." Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had "an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. "There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy." Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a "controversialist" but also "a kind man and a brilliant writer". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as "the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times". "The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office," he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been "the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. "In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine." Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: "Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour." Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had "trashed" him for 20 years, but always did so "with magnificently eloquent savagery" as well as "an irritating kernel of truth". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as "dark, ugly little trolls" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as "a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the "hernia on the end of England", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it "smelled of boiled washing". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a "dyke on a bike". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been "surprisingly excited" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as "The Blonde" in his restaurant reviews.	Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill has died, aged 62, three weeks after revealing he had cancer.
Harry Whitlam died after Gary Green, 51, of Bradburn Road, Wakefield, reversed the vehicle into him at Swithens Farm, Rothwell, near Leeds, in August 2013. Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been "changed forever". "It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle," she said. "My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared." "We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder," she added. "Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. "The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more." Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August. HSE inspector Julian Franklin said it was "an extremely tragic case" and described Green's behaviour as "reckless".	A drunken tractor driver who knocked down and killed an 11-year-old boy has been jailed for more than a year.
Police were called to a unit at Derwent Works, Matlock Road, Ambergate, at about 20:00 BST on Sunday following reports a man had been injured. The man, believed to be 19, was later confirmed dead in hospital. A file is being prepared for the coroner, but the force does not believe there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.	A man has died after apparently falling through the roof of a building at an industrial site in Derbyshire.
Volunteers at St Helier Lifeboat Station in Jersey have walked out amid claims Andy Hibbs was "bullied" by senior management at the RNLI. The RNLI said it asked Mr Hibbs to stand down "due to serious breaches of the RNLI's Volunteer Code of Conduct". Claims of bullying are taken "very seriously" and are being investigated, the RNLI said. Mr Hibbs said he thought the organisation was breaking Jersey's laws and said he is "humbled" by the support of his crew. Officials from the RNLI met the crew on Thursday evening after complaints were made against Mr Hibbs, the BBC understands. More on St Helier lifeboat crew resigning, and other Jersey news Mr Hibbs said: "I was sacked pretty much. The whole thing was just a joke. "I was being bullied by senior management in the RNLI and I refused to accept it." A statement from the RNLI said the situation was "incredibly complex" and a "confidential process". It said: "The RNLI has asked one volunteer at St Helier lifeboat station to stand down with immediate effect. "We have worked closely with the volunteer for some time but have been unable to resolve a serious breakdown in the relationship between the individual and the charity. "Unfortunately this impacted on the RNLI's ability to effectively deliver a safe and effective rescue service from St Helier. "Other volunteers have chosen to step down, which has forced the RNLI to declare the St Helier lifeboats off service temporarily. "We understand the impact of standing down volunteers and we do not take such decisions lightly." The St Helier lifeboat should be back in service in a few days, the RNLI said. A former member of Jersey's RNLI has said there will be a protest held on Sunday. Paul Battrick said there would be a "silent gathering" at 10:00 BST to support the volunteer crew members. He said he hoped the protest will get the RNLI "to see sense". Jersey will have lifeboat cover from the other Channel Islands stations - St Catherine's, St Peter Port and Alderney.	All 25 members of a lifeboat crew have resigned in protest at the sacking of their coxswain.
And I don't get to say that very often. On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60. (It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.) And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process. Next Wednesday. But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel. There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even. One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing. "There will be no major political apocalyptic show," he assured me. But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door. Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash. The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club. As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever. The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday. To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations. The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order. Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn. The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first. But any delay is painful for the UK. The Article 50 timer is set for two years and the clock starts ticking next Wednesday.	Brussels was abuzz on Monday.
The train firm said it would refund the difference in cost between mainline and high speed fares - to compensate for the loss of direct high speed trains. Southeastern will also give season ticket-holders from five stations a backdated 20% refund on mainline fares. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, said the line still needed repairing quickly. He said it had been a difficult time for rail users and it was right passengers should be compensated after the problems were caused when cracks appeared in the sea wall. Mr Elphicke said an emergency peak-time high-speed rail service between Dover and St Pancras to help commuters had made a difference. "We now need Network Rail to confirm how long it will take to repair the sea wall," he said. Steve Kilby, from Network Rail, said the team was working hard to get a final design in place for repairs. But, he said: "This week has been very stormy on the beach and our guys have been working through tough conditions." He said 15,000 tonnes of rock had been placed on the shingle to protect the railway from heavy seas and eventually more than 70,000 tonnes would be in place. The stations where passengers will be compensated are Sandwich, Deal, Walmer, Martin Mill and Dover Priory. Compensation claim forms are available for people at the station.	Passengers affected by the collapse of a railway line during storms in Dover are to be compensated, rail operator Southeastern has said.
Stoneman, who resumed on 83, reached 111 before he was run out to leave the visitors 252-7, still 13 runs behind. Paul Coughlin (49) and John Hastings took them ahead, but both fell to Rikki Clarke after lunch and Keith Barker finished the innings with his fifth wicket as Durham were all out for 327. Warwickshire lost two quick wickets but Ian Westwood (32no) saw them to 63-2. The win, which earned the home side a maximum 24 points, saw them maintain their unbeaten start to the season in Division One, while Durham have now lost two games, but remain second. However, the match will be remembered primarily for Barker's efforts with both bat and ball as he narrowly missed out on becoming the first Warwickshire player since 1911 to score a century and take 10 wickets in a first-class game - as his 5-103 gave him match figures of 9-157. Resuming on 189-4, still needing 76 runs to make the hosts bat again, Clarke removed skipper Paul Collingwood lbw early on although the former England batsman looked from from impressed with the decision. Stoneman soon brought up his first century of the season from 179 balls, but Durham were further in trouble when the out-of-form Phil Mustard edged Barker to William Porterfield at third slip. Then, just as it looked he would take Durham into the lead, Stoneman was farcically run out from the non-striker's end as he went for a single, but was sent back by Coughlin and 17-year-old substitute fielder Aaron Thomason swooped to send the ball back to Jeetan Patel who whipped off the bails. Coughlin and Hastings upped the scoring rate before lunch with a fifty stand, but any hopes of saving the game were extinguished shortly after the interval when both were out to Clarke (3-61) in the same over. Barker ended the innings when he had Chris Rushworth caught by Clarke to finish with his 10th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. Requiring just 63 for victory, but without captain Varun Chopra who was hit on the leg while fielding, the hosts soon found themselves 12-2 after Porterfield fell third ball and Jonathan Trott was run out. Westwood and Laurie Evans steadied any nerves to see their side home in 17.4 overs. Warwickshire all-rounder Keith Barker: "In these last two games we have been more 'Warwickshire' than we had before and hopefully we can carry that on. "I think we will always be up there or thereabouts in Championship cricket especially. "It is just a question of getting on a roll and making sure we are in contention towards the end of the season." Durham coach Jon Lewis: "We were pretty positive this morning. We felt that with six wickets left we were in with a chance of making something of the day. "Mark played really well but the run-out wasn't a great piece of communication, and unfortunately Mark was the victim. "It's a busy time coming up but we've shown resilience before. I'd like to not have to show resilience after defeat but that's something we're going to have to do."	Warwickshire wrapped up an eight-wicket victory over Durham despite a battling century from opener Mark Stoneman.
The Gaia satellite will be sent far from Earth to map the positions of more than a billion stars in our galaxy. Remarkable sensitivity should also enable the observatory to see hundreds of thousands of new celestial objects, including previously unknown planets. The main structure of the spacecraft was moved this week from the UK factory where it has been for a year to undergo tests on its propulsion system. EADS Astrium in Stevenage transported Gaia by road to Ampac-ISP at Aylesbury for checks on its cold gas micro-thrusters.  Once this work is complete, the structure will then go to Astrium's Toulouse, France, facility for final preparations. The European Space Agency (Esa) satellite is due for launch in 2012 on a Soyuz rocket from the new Sinnamary spaceport in French Guiana. Gaia is a successor to Europe's Hipparcos space astrometry mission which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It catalogued more than 100,000 stars in our galaxy. The new mission is a step change in capability, however.  Its billion-pixel camera system will give scientists an unprecedented 3D map of the sky. Over a five-year period, it will chart the precise positions, distances, movements, luminosities, and changes in brightness of stars.  These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy. And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life. What you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia's electrical and service module. This is the part of the satellite that will do all of the "housekeeping" in space. It contains elements such as the attitude and orbit control system, the avionics, the computer and data handling subsystems. A large antenna will go underneath the structure to allow Gaia to talk to Earth. What you do not see here is the payload module that will eventually go on top.  This will be the unit that contains Gaia's telescopes and camera system. Nor do you see the thermal shield which will open - petal-like - from the underside of the service module to give protection to Gaia's sensitive optics. "Gaia came to Stevenage about a year ago as a bare structure," said the Astrium UK Gaia project manager, Andy Whitehouse. "Since then we've integrated the propulsion system.  We've built all of that offline and then put it on the structure.  There's a lot of pipework that runs around inside, and the tanks are also inside as well." Mark Tomlin, the assembly and integration test manager, added: "There wasn't much time to bring all this together.  We've done almost 500 welds on the mechanical service module and that's taken us on the order of six months to achieve.  It's been a monumental task.  Each weld has to be X-rayed and cleaned." As a lead member state of the European Space Agency, the UK is playing a prominent role on the mission, both scientifically and industrially. The immense array of camera detectors, or CCDs (charge-coupled devices), is being provided by e2v at Chelmsford. "The bulk of the work going on here at Astrium UK is on the electrical side, not the mechanical side," observed Dr Ralph Cordey, the company's head of science. "This includes the crucial onboard processing units, which turn the prodigious amounts of data Gaia will get from its CCDs into a data stream that can be sent to Earth."

Georgina Callander, 18, was among 22 people who died in the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena on 22 May. Hundreds attended the ceremony at Holy Trinity Church in Tarleton, Lancashire. Attendees wore "a touch of yellow" at the request of her family, who thanked mourners for their "sympathy and support". Parents Lesley and Simon, with brothers Daniel and Harry, laid flowers in the village before the funeral. Shops were closed as a mark of respect as the funeral cortege made its way through. Bishop John Goddard said the service was a chance to "put aside hatred and look to embrace love and hope". A private burial service was held after the church ceremony. Ms Callander was described as "beautiful" by friends who said on social media that she was one of the first people taken to hospital after the attack. She was said to be a huge fan of 23-year-old Grande and was pictured with her in 2015. The final song played at the service was the US singer's hit One Last Time, which has become an anthem for fans since the attack. Grande performed an emotional rendition of the song at the One Manchester benefit concert on 4 June.	Streets of a village were decorated with pink and yellow ribbons for the funeral an Ariana Grande "superfan" killed in the Manchester terror attack.
Jackie Fox from Birmingham, Alabama died of ovarian cancer last year, aged 62, having used the talc for decades. Her family argued that the firm knew of talc risks and failed to warn users. J&J denied the claim and is said to be considering an appeal. Researchers say links with ovarian cancer are unproven. A company spokeswoman said: "We have no higher responsibility than the health and safety of consumers, and we are disappointed with the outcome of the trial. "We sympathise with the plaintiff's family but firmly believe the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence." The verdict at the end of the three-week trial was the first time damages have been awarded by a US jury over talc claims. More than 1,000 similar cases are pending nationwide and lawyers said thousands more could now be filed. Analysis: James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website Is talc safe? There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. But the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as "possibly carcinogenic" because of the mixed evidence. Why is there any debate? The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a "dose-response" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. But it adds: "Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer." The jury in Ms Fox's case deliberated for five hours before finding Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence and conspiracy. The award constituted $10m in damages and $62m in punitive damages. "This case clearly was a bellwether and clearly the jury has seen the evidence and found it compelling," said Stanford University law professor Nora Freeman Engstrom. "The jury was distressed by the company's conduct." However, she said the size of the award was unlikely to survive. "Big jury verdicts do tend to be reined in during the course of the appellate process and I expect that to be the case here," she said. Cancer Research UK says evidence for a link between talc use and ovarian cancer is "still uncertain". "Even if there is a risk it is likely to be fairly small," the charity says. Ovarian cancer charity Ovacome says causes of the disease are still unknown but are likely to be "a combination of many different inherited and environmental factors, rather than one cause such as talc". It says that in 2003, results of 16 studies involving 12,000 women showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third, and that a 2013 review of US studies involving 18,000 women had similar results for genital, but not general, talcum powder use. However, it warns that studies of this type "can suffer from bias" and there were "uncertainties" around the results. "A large well-designed American study in 2000 involving nearly 80,000 women found no link between using talc and the risk of ovarian cancer," it says. The charity says that even if using talc does raise the ovarian cancer risk by a third, "to put it into context, smoking and drinking increases the risk of oesophageal cancer by 30 times".	A jury in the US state of Missouri has ordered Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to pay $72m (£51m) to the family of a woman who claimed her death was linked to use of the company's Baby Powder talc.
Speaking about the 1948 contract Nye Bevan, the founding father of the NHS, offered consultants, he said he had "stuffed their mouths with gold". That gold was the ability to continue private practice - something senior doctors have carefully guarded since. Down the years, several ministers have had a look at the issue, but concluded it was simply too tricky to tackle. One former health secretary told me they thought consultants would simply walk away en masse if the government got tough. There has been some movement. In fact, the current contract had a little nibble at restricting private practice, by insisting that any doctor doing fewer than 11 shifts (of four hours each) a week offers any extra work to the NHS first before accepting private work. It has probably had some impact, but only a little. A full-time contract is 10 shifts, so it ties them to only an extra four hours a week before they are free to work in the private sector. But after years of shying away from the issue, the government looks like it wants to tackle this head on. It is not being explicit in coming out and saying it wants curbs on private practice. But the implications of the move by NHS England to publish earnings is clear: there is a suspicion that some doctors are raking it in and that affects their motivation when it comes to the NHS - both in terms of working extra hours for the health service and how productive they really want to be - and by publishing the details there is a hope it will make doctors think twice about how much they do. Longer NHS waiting lists means more private work as either people will pay to go private or, and this is more common, the NHS has to pay for patients to be seen privately. The private market is worth £4.6bn a year, according to market analysts Laing Buisson, with a quarter coming via NHS referrals. At a time when money is tight and ministers want to get more seven-day services, tackling this is clearly an attractive proposition. Although with the consultant contract currently in the process of being renegotiated (talks have slowed because of the junior doctor dispute), expect consultants to be hopping mad that their pay is once again in the headlines. It promises to be the mother of all battles. But if the register of private work is published, what will it show? What is known about the extent of private work is pretty sketchy. A British Medical Association survey from 2009 suggested about half of doctors in the UK (it's not limited to England) did private work - but this was a fall from six in 10 when it was done several years before that. Of those that did private work, a quarter earn under £10,000 a year, while one in six made in excess of £100,000. This included private hospital work, alongside earnings from other sources such as providing advice to pharmaceutical companies and assessments for insurance companies. But it must be said this was a self-selecting poll - doctors were not compelled to take part, so it is hard to gauge whether it was truly representative. There are plenty of specialities where private work is not so easy to come by. But there are others - orthopaedic surgery, urology, ophthalmology and anaesthetics to name just four - where there is plenty of work. It means for some, earnings can be extremely high. Average basic salary for NHS work is £89,000 in England. But this ignores a number of ways doctors can make much more. There are bonuses - called clinical excellence awards - which can be worth tens of thousands of pounds a year. Once awarded, they are difficult to take away. And then there is overtime work. For some, this can be pretty lucrative - a BBC investigation earlier this year found one made £375,000 in a year. Now that figure is very revealing. That consultant was thought to be on a special deal as they worked in an area where there is a shortage of consultants. It meant the NHS was prepared to pay them close to what they could have got on the private market. All in all, it suggests there are consultants out there earning in excess of £500,000. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter	The fight over NHS consultants' private work - and that is exactly what this is - goes back to the very start of the NHS.
Shots were fired from a car near St Brendan's Primary School and the victim was hit a number of times. The shooting happened shortly after 15:00 GMT. Ch Insp Jon Burrows said: "There are no words to describe the foolhardiness and complete disregard for the safety of the children and parents who were in the area at the time." BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said the victim is a well-known criminal. The man is receiving treatment for his injuries. Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.	A man has been shot outside a primary school in Craigavon, County Armagh, as children were leaving the grounds.
The party's Anna McMorrin polled 26,081 votes with the Tories' Craig Williams on 21,907. But Tory Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns narrowly held on to his Vale of Glamorgan seat, with party colleague David Davies retaining Monmouth. In Pontypridd, Owen Smith had more than double the number of votes of Conservative Juliette Ash. And Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds had nearly twice as many votes as the Tories' Graham Smith in Torfaen. Ms McMorrin said Labour fought "a very positive and energetic campaign" in Cardiff North, with lots of people out knocking on doors. She said it was a combination of Welsh Labour and the message from the UK party that gained the victory. The new Cardiff North MP said the Conservatives made it into a Brexit election and it is now important the country gets "the best, most sensible deal". Craig Williams, who lost the seat for the Conservatives, said there should not be a rush to judgement. In a tweet to thank supporters, he said he was "heartbroken", adding "sorry I let u down". Jessica Morden beat the Conservatives' Natasha Ashgar by more than 8,000 votes to retain her Newport East seat. And Chris Evans held Islwyn with 58.8% of the vote, while Gerald Jones held Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. In Blaenau Gwent, Nick Smith beat Plaid Cymru with 18,787 votes to 6,880. Paul Flynn retained the Newport West seat, as did Ann Clwyd in Cynon Valley and Wayne David in Caerphilly. Chris Bryant comfortably retained Rhondda, a seat taken by Plaid leader Leanne Wood in the assembly election, with almost three times as many votes as the Plaid candidate. Chris Elmore also retained Ogmore, Jo Stevens kept Cardiff Central, Kevin Brennan kept Cardiff West and Stephen Doughty held on to Cardiff South and Penarth, all for Labour. The Tories had targeted Bridgend, but Madeleine Moon retained the seat for Labour by more than 4,000 votes. Jo Stevens, who boosted her majority in Cardiff Central for Labour to more than 17,000, said they had "run a very positive campaign". She said Jeremy Corbyn was "a fantastic man, an honest politician, people warm to him - you've seen bigger turnouts for young people". Owen Smith, who last year stood in a Labour leadership contest against Mr Corbyn , said: "I was clearly wrong in feeling that Jeremy wouldn't be able to do this well and I think he's proved me wrong and lots of people wrong and I take my hat off to him." He said he believed the Labour manifesto had been "incredibly popular". "People clearly warmed to the radical ideas that were proposed in the manifesto," he added. "They want an end to austerity - they want to see a government that invests in public services and we were hearing that on the doorsteps." Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan dedicated his victory to the late former First Minister Rhodri Morgan, who had launched his campaign. "One of the reasons we've done so well in Wales and across the country has been the positive manifesto we had, the positive ideas in comparison to a pretty bleak negative vision of a hard Brexit, a laissez-faire, less equal society under the Conservatives," he said.	Labour has taken the Cardiff North seat from the Conservatives.
Gubbins (109) hit 15 boundaries as he enjoyed a 198-run partnership with opener Sam Robson (99). Robson fell one run short of a fourth ton of the season, being bowled by Joe Leach (4-64) for 99 as the Somerset bowlers remained accurate. Despite a middle-order wobble, Paul Stirling (85) played solidly as Middlesex reached 407-9 at stumps. Resuming on 139-0, Robson and Gubbins continued their excellent opening partnership before Robson was dismissed. Gubbins brought up his century from 208 balls before nicking Jim Allenby (3-51) to Marcus Trescothick at slip. There was some hope for Somerset as Middlesex lost four wickets for 39 runs, but Stirling steadied the innings. He fell to Leach five overs before stumps after pushing Middlesex into a lead, but a draw still looks the most likely result.	Nick Gubbins scored his first Middlesex century as their batsmen closed down Somerset's commanding total at Lord's.
Wolverhampton City Council said in 2014 the authority faced the prospect of "becoming insolvent", unless it made "very deep and very fast cuts". The Labour-run council approved plans on Wednesday to cut a number of services, including neighbourhood wardens, and increase council tax. However, unions said they feared service standards would drop. The council said the scale of cuts it would need to make by 2019 had risen to £134m - an increase on the £123m it predicted in 2014. The authority said this was "largely due" to the rising costs of children's services, pay and pensions, and continuing government cuts. In 2014, it announced it would have to cut 1,400 jobs and make massive service reductions or it would be down to its last £620,000 and "bankrupt shortly after". Cabinet member for resources Andrew Johnson said: "We are now realistically looking at the prospect of becoming insolvent unless we make cuts." The council said it had moved on "dramatically" since that announcement. "This no longer reflects where we are," it said, in a statement. "The council has made it abundantly clear that it will do what was required to balance the books." However, Wendy Thompson, leader of the Conservative group, said the authority had simply pushed its debt repayments back to give itself some "breathing space". "That's they only way they are staving off this situation," she said. "Their priorities over the years have been 'spend, spend, spend'. It's an unhappy situation for Wolverhampton. Our poor residents have a city centre that has so much dereliction and so many empty shops. "We desperately need to turn the city around." On Wednesday, the council agreed to axe the neighbourhood wardens service, despite a 4,500-signature petition from the public, and raise council tax by 1.99%. Council leader Roger Lawrence said: "The savage cuts from central government that continue to unfairly target areas like Wolverhampton have made it impossible to continue to offer the level of services the city deserves." Nick Keleher, secretary of the TUC in Wolverhampton, said the wardens did a "very useful job". "The petition forced a debate in the council but now it is intending to cut the service despite the public campaign," he said. "A lot of services have already been cut or transferred to the private sector. "I have seen colleagues who have lost their jobs with the council move into the private sector. They have been very disappointed with the standards." The government said: "Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to pay off deficit left by the last administration, including local government." It said Wolverhampton's spending had increased during its time in office.	A council that said it feared becoming "bankrupt" has agreed to make a further £46m of cuts by 2019.
The staff who would be relocated would be those who already process payments made in euros for HSBC in Canary Wharf. Thursday's referendum result means the UK will need to renegotiate its trade relationship with the European Union - including whether it remains part of the single market. HSBC declined to comment. Chris Cummings, chief executive of financial lobby group TheCityUK, said it was focused on securing continued access to the single market and warned of the risk of "prolonged uncertainty" while a new relationship with the EU was negotiated. Eurozone leaders have warned that without unrestricted access to the EU, London's big finance firms could move operations outside the UK. The head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said limited access to the single market would be the "price" of the UK leaving the EU. If the UK was not in the single market or the European Economic Area (EEA), it would mean the loss of "passporting", which allows banks to operate without restriction in all EEA countries. The EEA comprises the 28 members of the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. EEA rules allow those non-EU countries to be part of the EU's single market, as long as they allow full freedom of movement of people. The head of France's central bank, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, also warned that London's banks would lose their "financial passport" outside the single market or EEA. John Cryan, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said he thought London would lose some of its status as a financial hub. "The financial centre won't die, but it will get weaker," he told German business newspaper Handelsblatt. Mr Cryan did not comment on the possible impact of the leave decision on Deutsche Bank, which employs at least 11,000 staff in the UK. Meanwhile, sources at Standard Chartered told the BBC it was unlikely that the Asia-focused bank would move any staff from London. Leave campaigners have dismissed concerns of widespread job losses, saying Britain should focus on developing trade relationships with non-EU countries. Gerard Lyons, a UK economist who backed the Leave camp, said London would not be displaced as Europe's financial centre. "We have the depth of skills, knowledge and experience that's hard to replicate," said Mr Lyons, an economic advisor to Boris Johnson. Passporting for finance firms is a "negotiable issue" with the EU, he said, particularly as several European banks also use those rules to access the UK. HSBC already has more than 10,000 staff working in Paris. The London-based bank has about 48,000 UK workers across its retail and investment banking operations. A year ago, it said it was planning to cut 8,000 jobs in the UK to reduce costs. Earlier this year, the bank said it would keep its global headquarters in London, following a review. On Friday, sources told the BBC that up to 2,000 jobs at the US investment bank Morgan Stanley could be moved from London to Dublin or Frankfurt. Morgan Stanley denied that jobs will be moved. Banks and other financial companies can be authorised to do business in one member state of the EU, or the slightly wider European Economic Area (EEA), and then ply their trade across the region without having to be separately authorised in each country. The EEA is a grouping made up of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein who have access to the EU's single market. A bank using this system can provide services by offering them from its home base to a customer in another country, or it can establish a branch abroad. It is widely used by financial firms (not just banks) in the EU. It is also used by companies from outside the EEA, such as Switzerland and the US. They establish themselves in one place in the EU, typically in London as the continent's dominant financial centre, and use that as their headquarters for selling services across the single market. If the banking passport is no longer available to British-based firms, then some operations would clearly have to shift to a location inside the EEA. What is impossible to judge is just how much business, and how many jobs, would be affected. Would any shift be narrowly focussed on those functions serving EEA customers? Or would firms find it more cost effective to move other parts of the business as well? Read Andrew's full analysis on passporting.	HSBC would move up to 1,000 staff from London to Paris if the UK left the single market, following Britain's vote to leave the EU, the BBC understands.
Bielik, 17, who underwent his medical at Arsenal last week, signed for Legia from their Polish rivals Lech Poznan in July and has made six appearances in all competitions this season. Arsenal say the deal "is subject to the completion of regulatory processes". The Poland Under-17 international can play in both a holding midfield role and at centre-back. He said: "I've decided to move to Arsenal and although I cannot be sure of what's to come in the future, I'm going to London to fulfil my dreams. "I'm grateful to my team-mates and manager Henning Berg for trusting such a young player and giving me a chance to play for the first team. It's mostly thanks to him that I'm able to move to Arsenal." Berg said: "Krystian is a very talented player, who is going to achieve big success in football in the future." For each position, select whether you think Arsenal are sorted, or if a player is needed.	Arsenal have signed teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik from Legia Warsaw for a reported £2.4m.
Twelve homes were evacuated after the hole opened in Ripon, North Yorkshire, at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday. The hole measured about 20m (66ft) by 10m (33ft) and 9m (30ft) deep. The BGS said Ripon lies in one of the most susceptible areas of the UK for sinkholes because of its "Permian gypsum deposits". It said these can dissolve more quickly than surrounding limestone, leading to the enlargement of underground caves. Experts are still examining data from the site behind the houses in Magdalen's Road but, releasing its initial findings, the BGS said sinkholes were often caused by surface water penetrating the ground, or fluctuations in groundwater levels. In 2014, a 100-year-old detached house in an adjoining street was demolished after a 25ft-wide (8m) sinkhole opened. According to the report, the wider area of Ripon periodically encounters sinkholes and in the 1980s and 1990s a hole was appearing every two to three years. No-one was injured in the latest collapse with the back gardens of two properties the worst affected. A sewerage system connected to several of the properties on the terrace fell in as the hole appeared. One resident described seeing the ground moving and finding her steps leading into the garden had gone. On Friday, further cracks appeared in the ground and on walls at the site. Ben Cairns, North Yorkshire Fire Service station manager, said: "Our main concern at the moment is what impact the weather is going to have for the next few days." The BGS is continuing to analyse data from the site.	A large hole that appeared behind a row of houses was in one of the UK's most susceptible areas for sinkholes, the British Geological Survey has said.
The service is available to Three customers travelling to the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark. European authorities have been clamping down on roaming charges. But Three is the first network to abolish them altogether, albeit in selected countries, where it has sister networks. Three says customers on a pay monthly contract would be able to use their allowances of free minutes, texts and data with no extra charges for being abroad. However, those on unlimited plans will be subject to some restrictions. In a press release, Thomas Malleschitz, marketing director at Three, said: "By abolishing expensive roaming charges in select countries, we are allowing our customers to get even more value from their minutes, texts and data abroad by removing the fear associated with staying in touch while travelling." Analysts say that other operators of mobile phone networks are likely to follow Three's lead, particularly those who already have a presence in other countries. Matthew Howett, a senior analyst at consultancy firm Ovum, says the deal from Three is also interesting because it applies to nations outside the European Union, where there has been pressure from authorities to lower roaming charges. "Reducing roaming charges outside of that bloc will welcomed by many, since prices have remained stubbornly high in some countries," he said.	Three has announced that it has abolished international roaming charges in seven countries.
British police accuse him of stealing $250m (£160m) over eight years. The prosecutor called him a "thief in government house". Ibori, once seen as one of Nigeria's wealthiest and most influential politicians, was arrested in 2010 in Dubai and then extradited to London. Some $35m of his alleged UK assets were frozen in 2007. As his trial at London's Southwark Crown Court was about to begin, Mr Ibori changed his plea to guilty and admitted stealing money from Delta state and laundering it in London through a number of offshore companies. The BBC's Chris Summers says between 20 and 30 of Mr Ibori's supporters turned up to court - some wearing T-shirts with the slogan "Free Ibori". There was not enough room for them all in the public gallery. Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had "tricked" his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record. "He was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state's wealth and hand out patronage." He is due to be sentenced on 16 April. Ibori's wife, Theresa, his sister, Christine, his mistress, Udoamaaka Okoronkwo, and his London solicitor, Bhadresh Gohil, have all been convicted of money-laundering. Their convictions could only be reported on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted. Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK's Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor's financial affairs. "The vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori's lavish lifestyle," Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said. "We will now be actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta State." He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world. Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London - he paid £2.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion - and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say. Three of the money-laundering charges relate to the sale of Delta state's share in mobile phone company V-Mobile to neighbouring Akwa Ibom state. This raised $37m which Ibori stole and laundered through his solicitor Gohil, who has been jailed for 10 years. In 2007, a UK court froze assets allegedly belonging to him worth $35m. His annual salary as Delta state governor was less than $25,000. He had already left the UK when his assets were seized but he was arrested in Nigeria later that year. The charges were dismissed but he was then re-arrested in Dubai on a British warrant. Ibori has been convicted in the UK before - in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes. He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590. Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers. Under its federal system, state governors enjoy huge powers and control budgets larger than those of many West African countries. They have immunity from prosecution while in office. Two other former state governors have been convicted of corruption charges in Nigeria, after fleeing the UK while free on bail.	James Ibori, a former governor of one of Nigeria's oil-producing states, has pleaded guilty in a UK court to 10 counts of money-laundering and conspiracy to defraud.
The 97 jobs will be created over the next five years. The firm began operating in Northern Ireland in 2012 and now employs about 100 people. Invest NI is supporting the investment with a grant of £727,500. Axiom is based in the US and employs around 1,200 people. The new posts in Belfast will have average salaries of £40,000. They include a mix of lawyers, project managers and technologists. Axiom provides out-sourced legal services. It recently announced a major partnership with an investment bank to provide improved risk management in derivatives. Kate Docherty of Axiom said the company had been "delighted by the success of our operation in Belfast and its contribution to our growth globally". "Our expansion in this region is a testament not only to that growth, but to the skilled pool of available talent in Belfast who have made that success possible," she added.	The legal services firm Axiom UK is to double its Belfast workforce in a £9m investment.
The 75-year-old was recovered unconscious from the water at Tywyn, by a crew from Aberdovey RNLI Lifeboat at 16:14 BST on Saturday. He was flown to hospital by the coastguard rescue helicopter but later died. The girls were taken to hospital as a precaution. In a separate incident, three people including a 16-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, were rescued from the sea in Harlech at about 15:30 BST on Saturday. Harlech Coastguard team, Criccieth RNLI Lifeboat, North Wales Police and paramedics were involved in the rescue. North Wales Police warned people to take extra care in the sea and to avoid taking risks.	A man has died after attempting to rescue two teenage girls who got into difficulty in the sea in Gwynedd.
Gavin Roberts, 28, died of a brain injury on 15 June, four days after the collision on the A34 near the Compton junction in Oxfordshire. Megan Williamson's petition calls for the speed limit to be reduced. One month on from the crash that killed him she said "changes need to be made". "I just knew that Gavin would not want anybody to suffer as we have," she said. She wants the speed limit reduced from 70 mph to 50 mph, saying "people treat it like a motorway and it is a very narrow road". "There's no hard shoulder either, so if there are any accidents the emergency vehicles find it difficult to get down there." Mr Roberts was originally from Australia but had recently moved to Swindon where he worked for Network Rail. On the night of the collision, a Vauxhall Corsa travelling southbound smashed through the central reservation and into the path of Mr Roberts' BMW. Richard Hayes, the chief executive of the Institute of Highway Engineers, said Ms Williamson's suggestion would make the road safer, and called for the A34 to be upgraded. He added: "I'm absolutely sure [the barriers] are not as integrated as they should be... and that may well be eased by reducing the speed limit." The carriageway was closed 15 times in 2015 due to fatalities or injuries, and 56 times in the last five years, Highways England confirmed. A spokesman said safety was its top priority, and that it monitored the A34 on an ongoing basis. "Our thoughts go out to all those affected by the recent tragic incident," he said. Thames Valley Police said no arrests had been made following the collision and it was still appealing for witnesses.	The girlfriend of a man who died on a stretch of road where more than 50 people have been killed or injured in the last five years has called for tougher speed restrictions.
Three girls, aged 10, eight and five, and two five-year-old boys were taken to hospital following the collision on Wentedge Road, near Kirk Smeaton. The crash, involving a red Mercedes A180 and a blue Vauxhall Corsa, happened at about 18:20 on Thursday. North Yorkshire Police said a number of the casualties had suffered serious but not life threatening injuries. Women aged 36, 19 and 18 were also taken to hospital. The force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward. The road was closed for about four hours to allow investigators to examine the scene.	Five children and three adults have been injured in a crash involving two cars.
Edinburgh Airport said more than 781,000 passengers passed through its doors last month, a year-on-year increase of 11.7%. Glasgow saw its traffic rise by 8.4% to nearly 600,000. Meanwhile, Aberdeen International Airport reported its lowest decline in passenger numbers for almost two years. Edinburgh said most of its growth last month came from international flights, which were up by 11.6% on the same period last year. Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar: "After a record-breaking 2016, it is fantastic that we start 2017 with strong figures. "We are now seeing the impact of launching 27 international services in 2016. " At Glasgow Airport, international passenger numbers grew by 16.1% as a result of strong demand on routes to Toronto, New York and Dubai. EU-scheduled traffic was up 21.4%, following a rise in capacity on some winter sun services and city breaks. Domestic traffic grew year-on-year by 2%, with increased uptake reported on routes provided by British Airways, Easyjet and Flybe. Glasgow Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "Last year was our busiest on record, so it's pleasing to see this momentum has continued into 2017 with our best-ever January passenger numbers." Meanwhile, Aberdeen International Airport recorded its lowest decline in passenger numbers for almost two years in January. A total of 207,100 passengers travelled through the airport during the month, 1.7% fewer than a year ago. Domestic traffic rose by 0.6%, while international traffic fell by 2.5%. Helicopter traffic was down 7%, which the airport attributed to "inclement weather conditions in overseas locations" and the temporary recall of Sikorsky S92 helicopters early in the month. Airport managing director Carol Benzie said: "It's hugely encouraging that last month we saw our lowest decline in passenger numbers since March 2015, which is a fantastic start to the year. "I'm delighted that our domestic traffic increased and I'm confident that the overall figures would have been even healthier had our helicopter traffic not been impacted by a maintenance recall." Ryanair is to extend its Aberdeen schedule in May by introducing a new link to Faro, which will coincide with the relaunch of Air Baltic's Riga route, as well as new flights to the Faroe Islands with Loganair.	Scotland's two busiest airports have recorded their best January on record, following a marked increase in demand for international travel.
John "Jack" Zawadski, 82, and his nephew filed the lawsuit after being told that the funeral parlour did not "deal with their kind". Their legal team argue the response of staff at the Picayune mortuary devastated Mr Zawadski and his family. But the co-owner of the funeral home has tearfully denied the allegations. "We just didn't do that," a weeping Henrietta Brewer told Mississippi Today. Mrs Brewer said that her mortuary had handled the funerals of "well over a dozen" gay people since she and her husband opened it in 2006. She said one gay man had even been buried in the funeral home's privately-owned cemetery. "We're the ones that treat everyone good," Mrs Brewer said, arguing that none of her staff was homophobic. 'Bob was my life' Mr Zawadski and his nephew, John Gaspari, are seeking unspecified cash compensation from the Brewer Funeral Home for "breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress", Lambda Legal said in a press statement. The lawsuit says that Mr Gaspari had completed all the arrangements for the funeral of his uncle, Robert Huskey, who died in a hospice shortly after celebrating his 86th birthday. They argue that the funeral parlour suddenly declined the use of their facilities - including the storage and transport of Mr Huskey's body - after they found out he was married to a man. Mr Zawadski said that the alleged action of the funeral home left him feeling as "if the air had been knocked" out of him. "Bob was my life, and we had always felt so welcome in this community. And then, at a moment of such personal pain and loss, to have someone do what they did to me, to us, to Bob, I just couldn't believe it. No-one should be put through what we were put through." Lambda Legal Counsel Beth Littrell said that what had happened to them was  shocking. "Almost immediately after losing his husband and partner of more than 50 years, Jack Zawadski's grief was compounded by injustice and callous treatment from the very place that should have helped ease his suffering," she said. Mr Zawadski and Mr Huskey moved to Picayune to retire, getting married there when it became legally acceptable for them to do so in 2015.	A mortuary in Mississippi is being sued by the husband of a gay man for allegedly refusing to cremate him because of his sexuality.
Cordina lost a split decision to Hurshid Tojibaev in the last-16 of the lightweight division at Rio 2016. The 24-year-old, who won bronze the 2014 Commonwealth Games, said there were a number of factors to consider before turning professional. "As it stands I'm still a GB boxer, still in camp but in the near future I will be turning professional," he said. "I couldn't put a date on it. There's a lot of things that can affect things when you turn pro. "You don't get the support from the lottery and UK Sport, you're on your own and it's a tough call." Having achieved his goals of competing at the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, Cordina said his ultimate ambition would be winning a world title. Cordina knows two-weight world champion Joe Calzaghe and trains in the same gym, St Joseph's in Newport, as IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby. "I spar with him [Selby] quite a lot leading up to fights," Cordina told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "He's someone you look to and if I want any advice I'm sure he'd give it. "Same with Joe Calzaghe, if I look for any advice of him I'm sure he would pass it on. "There's some big fighters in Wales that are coming through. You've got Liam Williams, Andrew Selby, Craig Evans and Nathan Cleverly's won a world title. "Eventually when I do turn over I can follow in their footsteps." Promoter Eddie Hearn said this week that he has talks planned with several members of the Team GB squad for the 2016 Olympics. He previously stated to BBC Wales Sport that Cordina was the top prospect in the squad.	Welsh Olympic boxer Joe Cordina has confirmed he plans to turn professional in the "near future."
Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness. He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the clinic, which aids accompanied suicide. His wife Elaine and three daughters said they respected his decision. The family said in a statement: "Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace and away from the fear which surrounded him in the last few weeks of his life. "Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire." In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette last week, Mr Spector said: "If I am paralysed and can't speak, send me to the spirit world." He reportedly said the condition was affecting his nervous system. Friend Linda Earle, who had known him for 20 years, said: "He's fought it every step of the way. I've never known a man try so hard. "I don't blame him for a minute....it's no one else's decision but his own." Journalist David Graham told BBC Radio Lancashire he had spoken to Mr Spector at his hotel near the clinic in Zurich. Mr Graham said Mr Spector, a director of an advertising agency, had had a series of consultations with leading surgeons across the UK. "He had one operation which failed and I think that spurred him on the Dignitas route," said Mr Graham. In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK. He said it was "completely wrong" that terminally ill people did not have the option to end their life. "Whatever your take on the subject, it should be debated," Lord Falconer told the BBC. Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, clarified assisted suicide guidelines, making the prosecution of health professionals less likely. However, in April, disability rights campaigners who said assisted suicide policy was too "liberal" won permission to bring a legal challenge to her policy. Rob George, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said he was concerned about any possible law change. He said: "This is a dangerous distraction from providing decent health care, and actually it's the dying that we need to look after. "Our job is to look after people as they die... not in order that they die." However, the daughter of a woman who died at Dignitas last year said she wanted the law to change so that terminally ill people could end their life at home. Jayne Bramwell's daughter Lindsay said that it would help to "ease the path for everyone involved and make what is a horrendous time a bit easier". She said it was "enormously distressing" for her mother to have to travel to Switzerland in a wheelchair. "She just wanted to be at home and have all her family with her..." she said. In 2008, a paralysed rugby player from Worcester died at Dignitas. Daniel James, 23, had a collapsed spine following an accident during training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. The Director of Public Prosecutions said prosecutions in the case would not be in the public interest. Dignitas, which said it aided "accompanied suicide", often described as assisted suicide, has not commented specifically on the Jeffrey Spector case. The charity, founded in 1998, said: "The main work of Dignitas is not assistance in dying but in fact suicide preventive work, above all suicide-attempt-prevention work in a broad sense."	A British father-of-three who feared he would be paralysed by an inoperable tumour has died at the Dignitas centre in Switzerland.
Dr Waleed Abdalati told the BBC the that continued access to data is in "everyone's best interest". Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government. They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax. On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. "There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world," said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN. "We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community." Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years. He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues. "I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general," he said via email. "I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest." Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate. "Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore," Prof Paterson told BBC News. "If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites." Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead. Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear. "I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard," said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). "That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you," said Prof Robert Paterson, The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was "not authorised". Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations. "Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing," said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University. "A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level." But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this. Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump. He said: "What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!" "I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time." The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field. "It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other," said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. "This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off." Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook	Limiting access to federal research would do an "enormous disservice" to the US and the world according to former Nasa chief scientist.
Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who has a golden opportunity to close the title race deficit, was 0.107secs slower. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was second fastest, followed by Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes have so far not shown their true pace on an unusual weekend that has been dominated by Hamilton's engine penalties - which amount to 55 places following three engine changes, meaning he will start right at the back - and problems with tyre choices caused by the unexpected heat. Spa-Francorchamps is more usually associated with unpredictable and often wet weather, even in August, but this weekend has been baking, with temperatures in the low 30Cs. That means the tyres are suffering - a problem exacerbated by the fact that greater freedom for the teams in tyre choices than previously this year has meant they have leaned towards softer tyres. The super-soft tyre has never been brought to Spa before, because of the demands of its many long, high-speed corners. But Ferrari picked seven sets of the tyre out of their available 13, and only one of the more durable medium. Mercedes have gone the other way, splitting their choices much more evenly between the super-soft, soft and medium. That meant, with only four sets of the super-soft available, Mercedes did not use it at all until the final minutes of the session. It was not immediately clear why Rosberg was 0.768secs off Raikkonen's pace, but Hamilton had a lift in the fast double-left hander at Pouhon and then made mistakes at flat-out Blanchimont and on the entry to the final chicane. Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe told BBC Sport that the team were likely to give Hamilton only the least possible running in qualifying - probably meaning only one run in the first session - because of his penalties. "We'll probably just run the minimum necessary in qualifying," Lowe said. "We want to give Lewis the strongest possible race from the back and with the maximum number of tyres." Rosberg, despite his lack of headline pace in the final practice session, is expected to take pole, and there will be a tight battle between Red Bull and Ferrari for best of the rest. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen, who was fastest on Friday afternoon, did only two laps on Saturday before being hit by a gearbox problem. Hamilton is not the only driver with engine penalties. McLaren's Fernando Alonso, who was 11th fastest and two places ahead of team-mate Jenson Button in the session, has a 35-place penalty and Sauber's Marcus Ericsson 10 places. Belgian Grand Prix practice results Belgian Grand Prix coverage details	Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen set the pace in final practice at the Belgian Grand Prix as the Mercedes drivers were only fifth and seventh.
There are 56 cases involving 97 deaths. They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion. As the review got under way in Belfast, the time taken by police to security-vet and disclose classified case files was repeatedly highlighted as an obstacle in the way of progress. Twenty-two of the cases are more than 40 years old. Lord Justice Weir, the presiding judge of the Coroners' Service, is spending the next two weeks conducting preliminary hearings to assess the state of readiness of each case. Families of those who were killed and their legal teams have been asked to inform the court of the issues which are outstanding in each of the cases. The stalled inquests into the Army shootings of 10 people in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, and of five more civilians in nearby Springhill a year later, were examined on the opening day in Laganside Courts. The cases focusing on nine deaths linked to the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) alleged "shoot to kill" policy in the 1980s were also assessed. A barrister for families of two INLA members shot dead by the RUC in 1982 - Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll - criticised police after they said disclosure could not be completed ahead of a proposed September 2017 inquest date. A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) representative told the court at least another year would be required. The barrister for the Grew and Carroll families accused the police of failing to honour a series of similar disclosure commitments since the cases were re-opened in 2007. "Obviously there is the suspicion within the families that the PSNI have been dragging their heels over disclosure in order to protect the RUC," he said. "They are fighting a rearguard action on behalf of the RUC, which they have done successfully to date." Ahead of the review, a senior police officer said the disclosure delays were due to the huge pressures being placed upon the PSNI's Legacy Support Unit (LSU). Dep Ch Const Drew Harris said attempting to run the 56 inquests at the same time, rather than sequencing them in order, resulted in the LSU continually jumping from one case to the other. When the review is completed, a coroner will be appointed to hear inquests identified as ready to proceed. In the others, relevant parties will be instructed to provide any outstanding material needed for an inquest to take place. Some of the hearings are expected to take place later this year. The most complex and controversial ones are likely to be heard by a High Court judge, while others will be heard by a County Court judge. Justice Minister David Ford last year authorised the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to recruit "investigative support" for coroners dealing with the legacy inquests. The review was announced by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan in October, a month before he was appointed president of the Coroners' Courts. Sir Declan said he wanted to assure the families of those who were killed that he was "fully committed to doing all that I can, within my sphere of influence and with the resources at my disposal, to ensure that justice is delivered". But he also warned that it could be "many years" before most of the cases could be dealt with. Only nine legacy cases have been disposed of during the past five years, and 13 cases in total in the past 10 years. In November 2014, Sir Declan warned that inquests into deaths involving alleged state collusion and cover-up could go on until 2040 unless the coronial inquests system was changed.	A major review of inquests into some of the most controversial killings during the Troubles got under way on Monday.
Whether or not he is on the formal menu, Mr Snowden will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows. Ms Merkel's trip to the US is markedly different in tone and substance from her last visit to Washington in June 2011. Back then, there was a state dinner during which Mr Obama presented her the Medal of Freedom. He talked of a productive partnership with Ms Merkel, one of the few world leaders with whom he has established a warm connection. She referred to him more than once as "dear Barack". This week's meeting is much shorter and will be all business. Three years ago, the leaders spent considerable time talking about the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, and G8 efforts to support those democratic transitions. They reiterated the desire to achieve negotiated settlements to the vexing challenges of the Iranian nuclear programme. They discussed the pending change in military strategy in Afghanistan and the need to overcome trade barriers and accelerate economic growth. Three years later, the policy outlook is vastly different, although thankfully not all bad. For example, not only are negotiations with Iran under way, there is a decent chance they will be successful. The war in Afghanistan is winding down. The Afghan presidential election is going surprisingly well. Whoever replaces President Hamid Karzai is likely to agree to a follow-on Nato mission there. The most urgent regional transformation is not the Middle East, where an Arab Spring has, with the exception of Tunisia, become a humanitarian nightmare, but Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin has already overseen the redrawing of the European map and may be agitating for more. There is no longer a G8, but a G7, trying to co-ordinate sanctions that impose costs on Mr Putin while minimising the impact on the European economy, not as easy a task as some suggest. The costs to Mr Putin are increasing, even if the ramp is not as steep as pundits and even some government officials on this side of the Atlantic would prefer. This week the US imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia's high tech sector and the EU quickly followed suit. Such co-ordination is important since the lift over time will be much heavier in Europe. Its level of integration with Russia exceeds that of the US. Mr Obama is right to be patient while maintaining firm pressure on Europe to move beyond its comfort zone. Ms Merkel is not only crucial to meaningful European action, she is the only Western leader with real potential to influence Mr Putin. The Obama-Putin relationship has hit a brick wall. She arrives in Washington undoubtedly stung that a German-led European monitoring team is being held by separatists in Sloviansk, Ukraine. She has every right to expect Russia to use its influence to gain their release. The fact they have not is a clear indication of its intent to further escalate the crisis. While in Washington, Ms Merkel will also meet the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. As much as the crisis is about getting Mr Putin to stand down, it is about the need for Kiev to stand up, and for the West to redeem Ukraine's decision to integrate with the West. A vital step in resolving the crisis is enabling Ukraine to conduct a free, fair and legitimate election on 25 May. This is the object of Mr Putin's agitation, to manipulate conditions in ways that favour Russia's interests and undermine Kiev's. The West needs a comparable game plan to help Ukraine stand up a new government that Russia is unable to discredit. The meeting should touch on the long-term strategic implications of the crisis. The US has done an effective job of reassuring Nato allies regarding their mutual security interests. The presence of Nato forces in Poland and the Baltic states is a welcome manifestation of that commitment. Mr Obama and Ms Merkel will discuss the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which faces headwinds in both Europe and the US. It would be useful to make energy a centrepiece of these trade negotiations. Several European countries, including Germany, rely heavily on Russian energy, which gives Mr Putin important leverage in the current crisis. As US Secretary of State John Kerry told an Atlantic Council conference this week, the US has a new energy card in its policy arsenal. The Ukraine crisis presents a perfect opportunity to diversify Europe's energy sources over the next decade. While Russia and Ukraine will dominate the discussion, Ms Merkel cannot afford to ignore the Snowden issue and neither should Mr Obama. This is the first formal meeting between the two leaders since revelations that the US National Security Agency was monitoring her mobile phone. Americans should not underestimate the impact that the issue has had in Europe. Europeans have welcomed the reforms that Mr Obama and Congress are considering. Even if the issue has receded from the headlines, Washington needs to follow through. Ms Merkel herself has suggested it will take more than one meeting to repair the damage Edward Snowden's revelations have generated. This meeting is a necessary step in that process. PJ Crowley is a former US assistant secretary of state and now a professor of practice and fellow at The George Washington University Institute of Public Diplomacy & Global Communication	When German Chancellor Angela Merkel sits down for lunch on Friday with US President Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Ukraine will be the main course, and Edward Snowden the centrepiece.
Bethany Hill, 20, was found dead with neck injuries in Stratford-upon-Avon on 3 February last year. It is alleged she was killed by Jack Williams, 21, and his girlfriend, Kayleigh Woods, 23, at the flat they all shared in Hertford Road. The pair, who are on trial at Warwick Crown Court, deny murder. See more stories from across Coventry and Warwickshire here Opening the case, prosecutor Stephen Linehan QC said Miss Hill was a former girlfriend of Williams and had a "volatile" relationship with Woods, a transgender woman with whom she had planned to have a child. Jurors heard Miss Hill was found dead by a police officer in a blood-drenched bathroom. Mr Linehan QC told the court: "In the course of the killing, Beth's wrists were bound together with duct tape and the blade was used to inflict repeated cuts across the back of her neck before she was killed by the jugular vein being cut through." He said Miss Hill was found dead after Woods, formerly known as Kyle Lockwood, dialled 999 at 19:07 GMT on 3 February, telling the operator: "Well my best friend is dead in my flat." Alleging the "sadistic" killing may have been carried out for "perverted pleasure", Mr Linehan QC said: "What she was saying was that her friend had killed herself while she was out of the flat and that she had returned to find blood everywhere, and that she had cleaned up the flat before making that telephone call. "All of these things were lies. Bethany Hill had not died as a result of cutting herself - she had been brutally, brutally murdered. "She [Woods] lied because she was one of the two people who took part in the killing and the other person was the defendant Jack Williams. Mr Linehan said the pair had "set about trying to cover up the truth about what they did" from the moment of the 999 call. The court heard that Miss Hill, who was brought up in Bidford-on-Avon, had a brief relationship with Williams as a teenager. She then moved to Stratford to begin a college course, while Williams, also from the Bidford area, met Woods and moved in with her. Before the alleged killing, the court heard, Miss Hill had also moved into the flat in Hertford Road, using the bedroom, while Woods and Williams slept in the sitting room. The trial continues.	A woman was tied up and "brutally murdered" by her ex and his partner, who then tried to pass the killing off as a suicide, a jury has heard.
US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings. In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology. In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings. The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations. Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10. Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia. 1. California Institute of Technology 2. Harvard University 2. University of Oxford 4. Stanford University 5. Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6. Princeton University 7. University of Cambridge 8. University of California, Berkeley 9. University of Chicago 10. Imperial College London 11. Yale University 12. University of California, Los Angeles 13. Columbia University 14. ETH Zurich - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ZÃ¼rich 15. Johns Hopkins University 16. University of Pennsylvania 17. Duke University 18. University of Michigan 19. Cornell University 20. University of Toronto Source: Times Higher Education World University Rankings But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away. Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals. However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king. This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions". The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology. The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20. "No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place. "There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures." "It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate." Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US". "What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."	London has four universities in the top 40 of a global league table - more than any other individual city - although only one makes the top 10.
Lord Carey writes in the Daily Mail that he has dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill "in the face of the reality of needless suffering". But the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the bill "mistaken and dangerous". Peers will debate the bill on Friday. Tabled by Labour peer Lord Falconer, the legislation would make it legal for adults in England and Wales to be given assistance ending their own life. It would apply to those with less than six months to live. Two doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die. Some 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday. Insisting it would not be "anti-Christian" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked "undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society". He added: "Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope." When Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006. But in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: "The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering." He said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the "deepest influence" on his decision. Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was "huge". "I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents," she told BBC Radio 5 live. "Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell." There's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans. So what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation. One of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not "un-Christian" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives. It speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives. To hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey "makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes". "I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully." However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives. "What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?" he wrote in the Times. "It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law. "It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide. "Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'." The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a "strong case" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. The Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords. "The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking." But Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying. He said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed "very few people" would use the right to get help to end their lives. The Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012. The motion reaffirmed the Church's "support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected". And Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death. "I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people." Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited. "We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others. "I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards."	Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey says he will support legislation that would make it legal for terminally ill people in England and Wales to receive help to end their lives.
Last year's runner-up will bid to become the first top weight to triumph since Red Rum in 1974. A sell-out crowd of 70,000 is expected at Aintree Racecourse on Merseyside. Vieux Lion Rouge and Definitly Red are among the favourites with bookmakers expecting up to £300m to be wagered on the race. Travel for racegoers was expected to be disrupted as workers at three rail companies carried out a a 24-hour strike on the day of the Grand National. The official going at the track is described as Good, Good to Soft in places and a dry, sunny day is forecast with temperatures reaching 16C. Jockey Liam Treadwell will miss the big race after a fall at Aintree on Friday. Treadwell, who won the National in 2009 on 100-1 shot Mon Mome, will be replaced on 40-1 chance Tenor Nivernais by Aidan Coleman. Vieux Lion Rouge, which translates from French to Old Red Lion, is a leading fancy after winning the Becher Chase over the National fences in December and February's Grand National Trial at Haydock. Seventh in the National last year, he is one of four runners trained by David Pipe, and is about a 10-1 chance along with Definitly Red, an impressive winner at Doncaster last month for Brian Ellison. The National is a handicap chase, with each runner allotted a different weight to carry by the official handicapper Phil Smith. With 11st 10lb, The Last Samuri will be carrying more than a stone more than last year. Other contenders near the top of the betting include the JP McManus-owned pair More Of That and Cause Of Causes, Haydock runner-up Blaklion, and the Scottish-trained One For Arthur. However, the National has a habit of throwing up surprise results, as evidenced by recent years. The past five winners have started at odds of 33-1, 25-1, 25-1, 66-1 and 33-1. Irish trainer Mouse Morris scored an emotional victory last year with the now-retired Rule The World - 10 months after the death of his son Christopher. Morris, who runs Irish National winners Rogue Angel and Thunder and Roses this time, said: "We're going there with no pressure as the likelihood of winning it two years in a row is probably non-existent." Coverage of the National, over 30 fences and more than four and a quarter miles, is said to be followed by 600 million people worldwide. The marathon test see runners negotiate iconic obstacles such as Becher's Brook and The Chair. Terminally ill five-year-old boy Bradley Lowery is to be given honorary 41st place in the National racecard. The race is again due to start at 17:15 BST, having been put back an hour by organisers last year in an effort to further increase the audience. Armed police have been in attendance at the course during the three-day meeting which started on Thursday. This year's race comes in the wake of the Westminster terror attack and marks the 20th anniversary of the National being delayed by an IRA bomb scare. Media playback is not supported on this device Katie Walsh will seek to become the first female jockey to win the National after overcoming a late injury scare. Walsh was initially reported to be ruled out with a broken arm following a fall in the Foxhunters' Chase over the big fences on Thursday, but escaped with bruising. "I feel fine, a bit sore but I'm 100%," said 32-year-old Walsh, who will ride 33-1 chance Wonderful Charm, with opponents including brother Ruby on Pleasant Company. "There is only one Grand National and to get the opportunity to ride in the race again is brilliant." Wonderful Charm is one of five runners for Paul Nicholls - along with Cheltenham Gold Cup fifth Saphir Du Rheu, Scottish National winner Vicente, Le Mercurey and Just A Par. Media playback is not supported on this device Known as a unique challenge for horse and rider, the race draws criticism from opponents, including animal welfare groups. Officials believe amendments to the fences, and other alterations, introduced four years ago have helped improve safety. The course spent £1.5m on changes after two horses were fatally injured in each of the Grand Nationals of 2011 and 2012. Since then there have been no fatalities in the National itself, although in the same period there have been six in the four other races staged over the track during the year. BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght Pleasant Company is my selection to win for trainer Willie Mullins and jockey Ruby Walsh. The team triumphed with Hedgehunter in 2005 and Walsh was also successful on Papillon, trained by his father Ted, five years earlier. Pleasant Company put in a most encouraging performance to win at Fairyhouse. He'll keep out of trouble, before - hopefully - gradually picking off rivals and arriving late on the scene. The Jonjo O'Neill-trained More Of That was a champion over hurdles, and a respectable sixth in this season's Cheltenham Gold Cup, giving the impression he's coming to the boil. Scotland's One For Arthur is another gradually building his reputation, while Lord Windermere - who's not won since the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup - had top weight two years ago, but much less this time, and will have his favoured drier ground conditions. I can see him going well at big odds. Cornelius' 1-2-3-4:  1 Pleasant Company 2 More Of That 3 One For Arthur 4 Lord Windermere Jump jockey and BBC Radio 5 live pundit Andrew Thornton "It's still a great test of skill. You need some luck and your horse to take to the fences. "There's 40 runners, when most races wouldn't be near half that size, so you're hoping for a clear passage. "It's wide open this year. Definitly Red is likely to be popular on Merseyside with supporters of Liverpool FC. "I like Blaklion. The better ground will suit him, his jockey's in red-hot form and his trainer has won the race twice before."	A field of 40 horses headed by The Last Samuri is set to contest the 170th running of the Grand National on Saturday.
The best picture winner also garnered best director awards for Richard Linklater and best supporting actress for Patricia Arquette. It was shot over more than a decade to capture the passage of time in one boy's life from age 5 to 18. The annual critics awards are typically viewed as a pre-cursor to the high-profile and coveted Academy Awards. Other winners include actor Timothy Spall - named best actor for British painter JMW Turner in Mr Turner - and best actress Marion Cotillard for her roles in The Immigrant and Two Days, One Night. Actor JK Simmons won a best supporting actor prize for his role as a terrorising music teacher in Whiplash. The Lego Movie won best animated film, while Ida was named best foreign film. Citizenfour, about US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden, won for best documentary film. Presentation of the awards is scheduled for 5 January in New York. The New York Film Critics Circle, founded in 1935, counts members representing magazines, newspapers and online publications. The awards are considered a bellwether for the Oscars, which will air on 22 February.	Boyhood, a film 12 years in the making, has won top honours at the New York Film Critics awards.
The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483. Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: "I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. "We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. "There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. "They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket."	Rory Burns scored 287 runs in more than 12 hours at the crease to earn Surrey a draw with Hampshire at The Oval.
WhatsApp and similar applications make it possible for news organisations to reach the far-flung corners of the globe where other media are often blocked. Here are a few recent examples of how you have enhanced BBC News output by getting in touch via the app. A total of 38 people were killed in an attack on a beach in Tunisia on 26 June 2015. They were killed when a gunman, with links to so-called Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and he threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Eyewitness Anthony Ryan got in touch with us as the news was breaking. He was able to tell us what was happening from his balcony. He could see his hotel's entertainers on the beach and could hear shouting. He could also see that two people had been brought into the hotel next door on sun beds, and were badly injured. Simon Philips shared his experience of the attacks in Paris on the night of Friday 13 November. Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously. Mr Philips, a dual French and British citizen, was sitting with his girlfriend outside La Belle Equipe bar in the rue de Charonne in the 11th district, when two men opened fire on the terrace of the cafe. He described what he had seen as "endless scenes of war". "It was complete and utter chaos. The noise of the bullets outweighed those of screams and sirens afterwards," he said. Earlier last year, we reported on the most powerful earthquake to have hit Nepal in decades. Hundreds of people were killed, and many others were trapped and injured in the quake in April. Many of the BBC's eyewitnesses to this quake came through WhatsApp, which is widely used in that part of the world. Those affected ranged from local people to the region's many tourists and climbers on Mount Everest. As well as keeping us informed of news stories, you have been telling us how you use WhatsApp every day. Jean Macleod from Glasgow, UK, says she uses it every day to message her son, Ewan, in Australia. "He's in Sydney and I'm in Glasgow. It keeps us in touch every morning and night, and if I didn't have it I'd completely crash as I miss him so much. We're not always available at the same times, so it's a bonus alongside phone calls. I use it on holiday too. Last year, on holidays in Uganda, I kept in touch with all my family including my daughter in London, and husband in Glasgow." Mal Smith agrees: "I use WhatsApp to speak to relatives in Switzerland and for sending video and pictures to family and friends. My mobile provider charges me extra for sending pictures over their network." And Julia Kinsey says she uses it at home in rural Suffolk, UK. "Mobile signal is very patchy in our house," she said. "So I use it for communicating with family in London and friends nationwide. I would feel very isolated without it." Compiled by Francesca Neagle	Mobile messaging service WhatsApp is now said to be used by a billion people monthly, but it is not just a conduit for social chat and event planning.
Reports say the couple were beaten to death by hundreds of locals who then burned their bodies in the brick kiln where they worked in Punjab province. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called the murders "an unacceptable crime". Allegations of blasphemy are often used in Pakistan to settle personal scores or to target members of minorities. Police say the suspects are due to appear in court on Wednesday in Lahore. The victims have been identified as Shehzad Masih and his wife Shama. About 200 people in Lahore, mainly from the Christian community and human rights organisations, protested against the killings, which took place in the town of Kot Radha Kishan about 60km (40 miles) to the south-west. They held signs saying "Christian carnage in the name of blasphemy should be stopped" and "the government has failed to give protection to minorities", BBC Urdu's Shumaila Jaffrey reports from Lahore. Union leader Farooq Tariq told the BBC that the dispute was actually over money. "The owner of the brick kiln gave it a religious colour, and they locked up the Christian woman Shama for two days, then attacked her with shovels, then tortured her husband and threw them in the brick kiln. "It's the worst misuse of religion," he said. In a statement, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said "a responsible state cannot tolerate mob rule and public lynching with impunity". "The Pakistani state has to act proactively to protect its minorities from violence and injustice." Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam. Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been found guilty of desecrating the Koran or of blasphemy. While most of them have been sentenced to death by the lower courts, many sentences have been overturned due to lack of evidence. However, correspondents say even the mere accusation of blasphemy, or defending someone accused of blasphemy, is enough to make someone a target for hardliners. In May gunmen in the city of Multan shot dead a lawyer, Rashid Rehman, who had been defending a university lecturer accused of blasphemy. Last month a Pakistani court upheld the death penalty for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy in 2010 - a case which sparked a global outcry.	Pakistani police have arrested at least 43 suspects in connection with Tuesday's killing of a Christian couple accused of desecrating the Koran.
The 26-year-old had explored options with Williams and Renault but said on Sunday he was "happy and proud" to be with Force India. He added: "I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong." Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers. Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari are all retaining the same line-ups as this year and McLaren are promoting their reserve driver in Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne to partner two-time champion Fernando Alonso in 2017. Alonso's current team-mate Jenson Button has decided not to race next year. The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was "quite possible" he would not race in F1 again. Renault have long been expected to promote their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon into one of their cars next season, with both current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer under pressure for their seats. But Renault have not yet made their decision and are taking their time. The lack of availability of other drivers means either Magnussen or Palmer may be retained, although that is not believed to be Renault's first choice.	Mexican Sergio Perez is to continue with Force India for a fourth successive season in 2017.
Wellington Zoo said Lanky had arthritis and had been struggling to support his own weight. He had stopped eating or taking his medicine. He was euthanised "in his best interests", the zoo said in a statement on Monday. An Australian pelican, Lanky was the longest living resident of Wellington Zoo, arriving there in 1978. "Lanky had regular medical examinations and we were able to manage the arthritis in his ankles with pain relief and anti-inflammatories, but his lameness increased over recent months," said the zoo. His recent refusal to eat was in contrast to his appetite in better days, when he consumed a kilo of fish a day, sometimes "sneaking food off his neighbours" in his favourite haunt of Monkey Island, said Senior Keeper Phil Wisker. Pelicans from Australia do occasionally drop into New Zealand but Lanky was the only one permanently in the country. He originally arrived in Wellington from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, after being rescued with three other wild pelicans from a local drought, the zoo said. "All of us here at the Zoo are sad to see Lanky go, as he has been a real character and much loved by everyone who has cared for him over the last decades," it said.	New Zealand's only resident pelican has been put down after living at Wellington Zoo for nearly 40 years.
Earlier in the morning we saw a number of airstrikes in the Old City. Iraqi forces were still pinned down by snipers from the group that calls itself Islamic State. Colonel Jabbar Abad told us it was the last pocket of resistance. He claimed they would be defeated within hours. His troops helped a steady stream of civilians fleeing to safety. Mostly women and children. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped. The children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless. The families were given food and water. This, their first taste of freedom after three years of living under IS control. The battle briefly forgotten in their own fight for survival. If this is victory it has come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had to leave dead relatives behind. Almost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed. Search and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses. We met Ali, who had come to find his brother's family. Hoping against hope that some may have survived. He said IS fighters had been using their house when it was hit by a coalition airstrike a few weeks ago. Iraqi security forces had only recently taken the area. With tears streaming down his face, Ali held up his mobile phone and told me he'd spoken to his brother trapped under the rubble. But over the last few days there had been no reply. Ali helped the search and rescue teams make their way through the tonnes of rubble. They tried to console him when all they could find what must have been their remains, which they carried off in a black zipped bag. We watched them do the same at several other sites. Contrast that with the jubilation of the Iraqi security forces who mobbed Prime Minister Abadi as he arrived in the city to declare victory over IS. This is still a significant moment. The extremists have held the city for three years. It's taken nine months of brutal street to street fighting to dislodge them. This was their stronghold in Iraq. It was here, in the city's now flattened Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his one and only public appearance as Caliph of their so-called state. For many IS fighters Mosul is their graveyard, though it is still likely that some have escaped. The misery of Mosul is far from over. The UN estimates it will cost at least $1bn (£0.77bn) to restore the city's basic infrastructure - such as clean water and electricity. It will take tens of billions more to rebuild this city.	Even while the Iraqi prime minister was on his way to Mosul to declare the liberation of the city, there was still the occasional sound of gunfire and coalition warplanes flying overhead.
They've kicked up a stink with their council, who've decided to use the liquid to kill weeds around the city. It's all part of a trial to get rid of the unwanted plants without using strong chemicals, which some people think aren't environmentally friendly. But many locals say they're not happy with the unpleasant pong the trial's creating. They've started a campaign and also say they don't think vinegar is strong enough to kill the weeds. Bristol City Council say they'll continue with their trial, but will keeping track of feedback from the people who live there.	People living in Bristol have complained about a vinegary whiff in the air.
His decision to replace chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton with Nick Brown was met with some surprise last week. MPs Holly Lynch and Conor McGinn have resigned, it was confirmed. Ms Lynch tweeted it was "time to focus" on her marginal constituency while Mr McGinn said it was the "right time" to concentrate on his seat and his family. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn thanked them for their service and said that their positions would be filled "in due course". As his reshuffle continued, Mr Corbyn said 10 MPs who left the front bench in a mass walkout over the summer were returning. They are Jack Dromey, Pat Glass, Sharon Hodgson, Roberta Blackman-Woods, Kevin Brennan, Louise Haigh, Jenny Chapman, Matthew Pennycook, Nick Thomas-Symonds and Emma Lewell-Buck. Mr Corbyn said: "I am pleased to announce the appointment of 21 MPs to our front bench, 14 of whom are women and four of whom are from the black and minority ethnic community. "I welcome back the 10 who have returned, and look forward to working with the eight talented MPs joining the front bench for the first time." But, in response to the removal of Ms Winterton, the chairman of the parliamentary party, John Cryer, wrote to Labour MPs to protest that he had not been kept informed about the reshuffle despite being engaged in talks with the leadership on putting some shadow cabinet posts up for election. However, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, a Corbyn ally, contradicted the claim. She told BBC Radio Four's The Westminster Hour: "He was consulted. We felt it was important to have a full shadow cabinet in place for Parliament coming back." Whips are appointed to help ensure their party's discipline, including making sure MPs vote in line with the leadership. St Helens North MP Mr McGinn clashed with Mr Corbyn in August, when he accused him of threatening to use Mr McGinn's father, a Sinn Fein councillor, to "bully me into submission" after he spoke out against the Labour leader. On his website, he said he had been "very grateful" to the new chief whip for "offering me the opportunity to stay" but "I explained to him that I felt it was the right time for me to leave the front bench at this reshuffle to concentrate on my constituency responsibilities and my young family". He said the new team had his best wishes and thanked the "outstanding" Dame Rosie and colleagues for their support. Ms Lynch tweeted her best wishes to Dame Rosie's replacement, Nick Brown, adding: "It has been a pleasure to serve with @labour whips but with one of the most marginal seats, it's time to focus all my efforts on Halifax." Meanwhile, there were reports on Sunday that Labour rebels were planning to form their own "shadow shadow cabinet", in competition with the front bench, to produce its own policy initiatives.	Two Labour MPs have resigned from the shadow whips' office, just days after party leader Jeremy Corbyn began reshuffling his front bench.
The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too "narrow" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on the cause of the fire by September, followed by a wider probe into building regulations, council funding and other issues. The presumed death toll stands at 80. Police have warned the final figure will not be known until at least the end of the year. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Nick Paget-Brown, which was criticised for its response to the disaster on 14 June, quit on Friday. Retired former Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to head the inquiry on Wednesday. It will sit in public and have the powers to compel witnesses and obtain evidence. Visiting the scene of the blaze on Thursday, Sir Martin said he believed the probe and its recommendations would be "pretty well limited" to what had caused the fire and its rapid spread. Setting out his ambition to produce a report within a year, he said he was aware that people in the area want a broader investigation but he was not sure that his inquiry would be the right setting. The prime minister has said she expects an interim report to be made available as soon as possible and that survivors and residents should be consulted on the terms of reference. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted a guarantee the initial findings would be published by the end of the summer. In a letter to Mrs May, he said the inquiry would be best served by being split into two parts to ensure "timeliness would not have to be sacrificed for rigour". While understanding how the fire started was of the "utmost importance", he said survivors and other residents had a multitude of other questions about how their safety had come to be compromised and what could have been done to prevent the disaster. "Whilst the detail of the specific failures at Grenfell needs to be uncovered, it is also clear that the Grenfell fire has much wider implications for national policy issues," he said. The issues that must be addressed, he said, included: "An inquiry within narrow terms of reference risks failing to learn all the lessons of this tragedy." The PM has said the immediate priority is to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower and to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. But she has said the "wider lessons" must be learn from both this catastrophe, and the inspections of other buildings around the country that followed it.	The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire must be split in two stages to ensure all lessons are fully learned, Jeremy Corbyn has said.
The family of Joseph Mulhern, who was shot by the IRA in 1993, believe his death will feature in the inquiry, but they are bitterly divided over whether or not it should even take place. Mr Mulhern met a lonely, untimely death in July 1993. The 23-year-old was abducted and shot by the IRA, who alleged he was a police informer. His body was found on a remote hillside on the border between counties Tyrone and Donegal, dressed in a blue boiler suit and his hands tied with cable. Those were the tell-tale signs that he had been tortured before he was shot. For a long period during Northern Ireland's Troubles, Stakeknife was running the IRA's internal security unit, otherwise known as the 'nutting squad'. Stakeknife has been been named by the media as Freddie Scappaticci. But the west Belfast man denies the allegation. The secret agent is to be investigated in connection with the murders of up to 50 people. It is an inquiry that Joseph Mulhern's father Frank fully supports. "Stakeknife was employed by the state," he said. "Stakeknife knew when a lot of these murders were going to take place. "He obviously reported to his handlers and they did nothing to stop these murders. "The IRA have pulled the trigger but the state authorities could have prevented it as they would have known about it a number of weeks before [Joseph] was taken away. "Why did they not act?" But that is not the view of the entire family. One of those who carried Joseph Mulhern's coffin was his younger brother Fran, then aged 18. Not long afterwards, he left Belfast to study law in England and settled there. He feels the Stakeknife inquiry is focusing on the wrong people. He said: "The thing that I feel is really strange is that everyone is talking about Scappaticci, but ultimately what about the people who actually pulled the triggers? "It just seems like they are getting a free pass. "So, to me, the whole thing just smacks of being almost this inquiry to use as a political football to beat the British government with." Asked if he would welcome an inquiry that could shed light on what happened to his brother, he replied: "No, because it is not going to bring my brother back. "It keeps dragging up the past," he said. "And the second thing it does, is its just money that Northern Ireland does not have." It has been suggested the inquiry could cost Â£5m a year for five years. But those who have argued for it, like Joseph Mulhern's father Frank, say that figure has been deliberately inflated. "That sum has been mentioned, probably by the state authorities here, to try to make up excuses why they should not have an investigation," Frank Mulhern said. "They don't need to spent Â£35m because they have all their information and files in Castlereagh or Whitehall or wherever they keep their files." Fran Mulhern said he believes the way the government is dealing with past - by holding inquiries into some deaths but not others  - is not only unfair but is hampering political progress and reconciliation. "Either you provide something for all of the victims or you deal with none of them," he said. "You can't cherry-pick, and for me that is the big problem. "It seems to be we are going to look at this, but we are not going to look at that. "The young girl who lost her dad because he was in the [Royal Ulster Constabulary] and was killed by a mortar bomb has every bit as much right as someone who lost a family member at Loughgall or wherever. "Picking and choosing creates resentment and it doesn't allow the province to move on." Fran Mulhern lives in the north of England and rarely returns to Belfast. He is the only remaining male sibling in his family. The archive television footage of Joseph's funeral shows younger brother Liam, then aged eight, carrying a single red rose behind the coffin. By the time he was 15, Liam Mulhern was on remand accused of offences linked to the Continuity IRA. He was later jailed for dissident republican activities and died two years ago after taking ill in Maghaberry Prison. The two Mulhern brothers are buried in Belfast's City Cemetery beside their mother who died when they were children.	The activities of the army's most high-ranking agent, codenamed Stakeknife, are to be investigated but a date for the inquiry has yet to be set.
In 2014, the largest colony of the rare seabirds was at Winterton, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk but the birds have since moved north to Sea Palling. Two years ago there were 300 pairs of the rare seabird. This year there are just 190 pairs at Sea Palling. The RSPB said the species is declining. Little terns travel 3,000 miles from west Africa to breed on the UK coast but, according to the RSPB, the numbers returning to the UK have declined by between 30-50% since last year. It said the site near Sea Palling is still the country's largest colony, despite the significant drop in numbers. Fabienne Fossez, the Little Tern warden for RSPB East Norfolk, said: "We're extremely concerned, it's a species in decline and they are in real trouble. "What we don't know is what goes on out in west Africa in the winter but it is something to do with the climate, weather and food. "Nevertheless, we have a really good success story here near Sea Palling, despite all of the odds." Ms Fossez said 380 chicks have hatched at the east Norfolk site since mid May. Her team has been maintaining a 24-hour surveillance of the colony in order to protect the birds. But she said the breeding birds have not had the same level of success elsewhere. "The little terns have had a really difficult time this year," she said. "On the north Norfolk coast they were completely washed out at the beginning of June. We were protected here on the east coast and we are fortunate that there are just little terns nesting here."	Wildlife conservators have said they are "extremely concerned" that the number of little terns nesting in the UK's biggest breeding colony dropped by almost half in a year.
The country, formerly known as British Honduras, was the United Kingdom's last colony on the American mainland and still maintains strong ties with Britain. Today Belize, which considers itself part of both the Caribbean and Central America, is cultivating relations with Latin America and the United States, although there is a lingering conflict with neighbouring Guatemala, which has made claim to part of Belize's territory in the past. Tourism is a major source of foreign currency. Belize's attractions include wildlife, Mayan ruins and one of the longest barrier reefs in the world. Belize has a problem with violent crime, largely drug-related, and the trafficking of narcotics to the US, however. In 2011 Belize was added to a US blacklist of countries considered to be major producers or transit routes for illegal drugs. Population 324,000 Area 22,965 sq km (8,867 sq miles) Major languages English (official), Spanish, Belizean Creole, Mayan, Garifuna (Carib) Major religions Christianity Life expectancy 75 years (men), 78 years (women) Currency Belizean dollar Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, represented by a governor general Prime minister: Dean Barrow Dean Barrow was re-elected for an unprecedented third five-year term in office in Belize in November 2015. Mr Barrow was elected to parliament in 1984 and served in senior positions in UDP governments. He led the party in opposition until its victory at the polls in 2008, unseating the People's United Party (PUP) government of Said Musa, which had been in power for 10 years. Mr Barrow, a lawyer, has invested much of the $150m (Â£98m) Belize received from Venezuela in the past years in an ambitious infrastructure programme and road building. Belize is heavily dependent on aid from Venezuela, which also offers it oil at discounted prices. Critics of Mr Barrow link bringing the 2015 polls forward to a possible Venezuelan move to cut its funding. At the beginning of his new term Mr Barrow was expected to have to grapple with Belize's much larger neighbour, Guatemala, whose newly elected president, Jimmy Morales, said he would pursue with renewed vigour his country's claims over more than half of Belize. The constitution guarantees media freedom, but provides exceptions in the interest of national security, public order and morality. There are no official curbs, but internet use is low because of a lack of infrastructure and high costs, says US-based Freedom House. Belize has no daily newspapers; some weeklies are subsidised by political parties. Radio listeners rely on a range of commercial outlets, most of them networked nationwide. Privately-owned TV stations are on the air and cable TV is available in the towns. Some key dates in the history of Belize: 16th-19th centuries - The Spanish arrive; Spanish rule ends in 1862 when Belize is formally declared a British crown colony and named British Honduras. 1954 - Constitutional reforms give Belize limited autonomy; general elections won by People's United Party (PUP), led by George Price. 1964 - New constitution gives Belize full autonomy and introduces universal adult suffrage and a two-chamber parliament. In 1973, the country changes its name from British Honduras to Belize. 1981 - Belize becomes independent with George Price as prime minister, but Guatemala refuses to recognise it. About 1,500 British troops remain to defend the country against Guatemalan territorial claims. Guatemala recognises Belize's independence in 1992 although the territorial conflict remains. 2002 - Belize, Guatemala agree on a draft settlement to their long-standing border dispute at talks brokered by the Organisation of American States (OAS). The deal, which proposed referendums in both countries, is rejected by Guatemala in 2003. 2005 - Rioting breaks out in the capital during a wave of anti-government protests. 2011 - Belize is added to US blacklist of countries considered to be major producers or transit routes for illegal drugs. 2015 - Prime Minister Barrow leads his ruling United Democratic Party to a record third consecutive five-year term in a snap election. Territorial conflict with Guatemala continues; Guatemala has made claims to all or part of Belize since 1940.	Tucked between the Caribbean Sea and the rainforest on the eastern coast of Central America, Belize is the home of a small and diverse nation.
Witnesses said after the attack, at Forest Hill station at about 13:20 GMT, a man then chased other people outside the station. People said they saw a man attack another on the train then run out of the station shouting "he wanted to kill Muslims". A 38-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and remains in police custody. Train services were temporarily stopped on the line. Police said they were not treating the attack as terrorism, but as a hate crime. Ambulance officials said the victim, who is in his 40s, was treated at the scene for a stab injury and taken to a south London hospital. He remains in hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition. Emma Pinder, who was at the station, said a man had "chased other people outside the station with a knife". Shellby Curry, 24, from Forest Hill, said she saw a man "waving what looked to be a knife in his hand" near the station and screaming words like "Muslims... kill them all". She described the attacker as a black man with short hair, who she thought appeared to be in his late 30s or early 40s. Several people phoned the police, who arrived about 10 minutes later and restrained him, Miss Curry said. "I was walking along and someone stopped and said, 'be careful, he's got a knife'. As I looked around there he was. "I just grabbed my baby and ran across the road. Looking back I saw him marching up and down waving his arm about." Appealing for witnesses senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp, Paul Langley, said: "This was a serious assault on a man in broad daylight and we are aware that other passengers may have seen what happened or been threatened themselves. "We have spoken with many witnesses from the train but if you saw what happened and haven't yet contacted police, please do so as soon as you can." Services were stopped on the rail line but have since reopened with severe delays, London Overground said. Roads around the station were also shut for a while.	A man has been stabbed on an Overground train in south-east London.
BBC Sport will increase its TV coverage of all 12 international events, which will also be covered on the BBC Sport website and BBC Radio 5 live. "The deal strengthens the BBC's long-term commitment to athletics," said BBC director of sport Barbara Slater. "It is our biggest commitment in terms of coverage of the Diamond League on network television." The BBC has a separate deal for live coverage of the two UK Diamond League events in Birmingham (7 June) and the Anniversary Games in London (24 and 25 July) which runs through to 2020. Lamine Diack, the International Association of Athletics Federations president and chairman of the board of the Diamond League, said: "We are very proud to have a partner like the BBC to commit to such a broad coverage of our meeting series. "BBC's support is of course also great news with regards to the upcoming IAAF World Athletics Championships in London 2017 and confirms the importance of our sport in the UK."	Highlights of the 2016 and 2017 Diamond League seasons will be available to watch on the BBC as part of a new deal.
Media playback is not supported on this device Al Hasawi, who took control of the Reds in the summer of 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers. However, BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a £50m deal. The takeover would see the former San Diego Padres owner take an 80% stake in the Championship club. Moores' consortium were previously interested in buying Premier League side Everton, and the potential new owners met club staff last week.	Nottingham Forest owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi says he is close to agreeing a deal to sell the club.
It came as 100 writers protested outside the council, demanding it take measures to protect freedom of speech. Several writers have returned their awards to the council in recent weeks, protesting against what they call rising intolerance in India. The Akademi has condemned "any atrocity against any writer" in India, and urged writers to take back their awards. In recent weeks, growing numbers of writers have been protesting against book bans, the silencing of writers like Perumal Murugan following attacks by right-wing groups, and the killings of rationalists such as Malleshappa Kalburgi and Govind Pansare this year. The Akademi had been criticised for not speaking out against the attacks sooner, with over 40 writers returning their awards to protest the institution's "silence" on the "attacks against dissent". Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari had earlier called the protest "illogical", but accepted a memorandum on Friday from the writers, who held a silent march to the institution's headquarters. The Akademi then later issued a statement condemning "any atrocity against any writer anywhere in the country in the strongest of words". It also condemned the killing of rationalist Kalburgi "and other intellectuals and thinkers", and called on "governments at the centre and in the states to take immediate action to bring the culprits to book and to ensure the security of writers now and in the future". Speaking to the BBC, Githa Hariharan of the Indian Cultural Forum, made up of a number of writers who returned their awards, said that the Akademi statement was welcome although "late". However she said that the issues that had prompted the protests in the first place remained a matter of concern for writers. "The silence of the Sahitya Akademi was a tipping point for the pain and anguish felt by many of us who are struggling to recognise the India we grew up in. It became a symbol for our frustrations. But now it's time to move on to to addressing these larger issues as well," she said. The writers' protest was seen as unprecedented in India. Some of the writers who returned their awards included two of India's most highly respected writers, Nayantara Sahgal, and Krishna Sobti. Other writers like Shashi Deshpande, K Satchidanandan and PK Parakkadavu also returned awards and resigned from the Akademi's councils.	India's Sahitya Akademi, which bestows literary honours, has condemned recent attacks on writers and rationalists.
Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) that firearm officers needed greater public support. He also revealed that despite a push for more armed officers, there were not enough people willing to do the role. Sir Bernard is retiring after more than five and a half years in the post. During the speech, the Met's commissioner said public pressure on firearm officers had meant "we simply don't have enough people now wanting to do these jobs". "This a dangerous place to be... we can't afford to have officers think twice because they fear the consequences of shooting someone". "That's how they get shot or the public gets hurt or a criminal gets away with a gun," he said. Sir Bernard also stated that armed officers did not fire a shot at a suspect in more than 3,300 incidents involving firearms in 2016. "It's an urban myth that officers are trigger-happy," he said. The Met has said it will increase firearm officer numbers by 600, with more than 400 extra staff trained or selected to date. According to a staff survey, nearly half of Met Police officers believe more officers should carry guns.	Britain's most senior police chief has called for "less suspicion and more trust" in officers who carry guns, in his final speech before retirement.
The company said it had a "temporary network issue" which affected calls and texts during Saturday afternoon and evening. It said calls had since been restored and that it is working to restore full service. But some users on Twitter complained of their texts being sent to random numbers instead of their contacts. A spokeswoman said the company was "currently investigating the cause of the service disruption" and that it apologised for any inconvenience. It also said that some "customers and non-customers" may have received a message from an unknown sender on Saturday. In a statement on its website, the company said its advice "is to ignore all text messages that you deem incorrect".

Police said the attackers entered the property on Craigmillar Castle Road at about 20:15 on Friday. Police believe the attack may have been targeted. A 38-year-old man suffered serious, but non-life threatening, facial injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. The second victim, aged 49, did not need medical attention. Det Insp Alan O'Brien. of Police Scotland, said: "We believe this may have been a targeted attack and are working to establish the full circumstances. "I'd urge anyone who may have seen suspicious behaviour by three men in the area at this time to come forward. "We're also eager to trace any suspicious vehicles seen in the street around this time, and I'd again ask anyone who may have information about this get in touch."	Two men have been assaulted by three masked attackers at an address in the Craigmillar area of Edinburgh.
Hebridean Sea Salt will have its product stocked in Sainbury's 360 UK stores. The Â£180,000 deal is the Lewis-based company's first with a major supermarket. Hebridean Sea Salt makes its product by slowly evaporating water from Loch Erisort and then harvesting salt by hand. Managing director Natalie Crayton said she hoped the deal would allow the business to grow and increase production.	A Scottish sea salt business on the Western Isles has signed a deal to supply a supermarket chain.
Heavy rain seemed to have scuppered any hope of play on a night just three matches from seven got under way, and only two ended with a positive result. The Jets chased down Leicestershire's 88-2 to win thanks to Paul Coughlin (38 not out) and Paul Collingwood (34). In the South Group, Hampshire beat Gloucestershire by 24 runs in Bristol. Gloucestershire scored 175 in 19 overs, with Australian Michael Klinger hitting a magnificent unbeaten 101 from 58 balls, which included six sixes and seven fours. But openers James Vince (42) and Rilee Rossouw (45) ensured the visitors were always ahead of the run chase. The reached 121-3 to earn a 24-run victory courtesy of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system when the rain forced an early end. The victory lifted Hampshire four places to third in South Group. Durham Jets appeared to be facing a seventh straight defeat in this season's competition when a Luke Ronchi-inspired Leicestershire made 88-2 from their seven overs at Grace Road. The New Zealander smashed a six and five fours from James Weighell's first over and went on to make 63 from 21 balls. Despite losing both openers cheaply, former England batsman Collingwood and Coughlin teamed up to guide the away side to an unlikely victory However, there was drama in the final over as Collingwood and Jack Burnham were run out off successive balls before Coughlin hit the winning boundary as rain poured down across the ground.. "It was a bit of a surprise that we managed to get out there, the outfield was really wet," Collingwood told BBC Newcastle. "But, when you've got a win under your belt, your first win, you don't mind. I thought the guys showed a lot of character. "Things hadn't been going easy in T20 this year, but to stand up and chase that total down after what was pretty much a Luke Ronchi blitz in the first innings, was a great effort." Despite the victory, Durham remain bottom of North Group, with Leicestershire dropping two places to sixth. Sussex and Middlesex managed to make a prompt start to their match in Hove, but were eventually beaten by the rain which swept across the country. Middlesex were chasing a fourth T20 victory of the season and reached 136-6 from 17.4 overs when the players were forced off for the second time. Captain Brendon McCullum smashed a quickfire 26 early on, but he fell to Chris Jordan and some impressive fast bowling from Jofra Archer (2-17) kept the visitors in check. The worsening conditions meant the Sharks reply never got under way with the match abandoned just after 21:30 GMT. The games between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Northants, Birmingham and Yorkshire, and Glamorgan and Surrey were all called off before a ball could be bowled.

The Rolling Stones apparently charge $8m (£5m) to do a one-off performance, while Sir Elton John is said to require $4m. Kylie Minogue - who once sang at the wedding of the daughter of Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal - is reported to be a more affordable $2m. So for those of us without superwealth, arranging such a gig seems impossible. However, help may now be at hand thanks to three music fans and their London-based company Songkick. A concert notification website and app for your mobile phone and tablet, Songkick this year launched a new service called Detour. Essentially a form of crowdfunding, fans who wish to bring a certain band to their hometown or city can start a petition or "pledge" via Songkick. You enter your credit card details on Songkick's website or app, and how much you would be prepared to pay. If a sufficiently large number of people also pledge, then Songkick informs the band in question and its promoters. "We have launched the service in London, targeting smaller bands and venues," says Songkick's co-founder and chief executive Ian Hogarth. "But we plan to extend it across the UK and globally, and ultimately to the largest venues and artists. "Obviously there is no guarantee that the band or singer in question will ultimately agree to play in a certain town, but so far more than 90% have indeed done so to - performing live is after all how bands make the majority of their money these days." But if you and your friends are indeed successful in bringing to Rolling Stones to your town, how much do you pay via Songkick? Ian says: "You ultimately pay the ticket price as set by the band.  So if you have pledged more, you don't pay the difference. And if you have pledged less than the ticket price, we contact you to say you'll need to pay more. "And of course you can pull out of paying if ultimately you don't want to, or can't make the concert for some reason." So if that is how Songkick's Detour service helps music fans, how does it benefit the bands or solo artists? Put simply, Songkick passes on vital information to bands about how many people would like to see them play live in a certain place - and the prices they are prepared to pay for tickets. From this data bands can work out which towns and cities to go to, the correct size for a venue, the optimum number of concerts to play and how much to charge. And Songkick gets a cut of the ticket price. With an average of 50% of all concert tickets currently going unsold in countries such as the UK and US, Songkick claims the information it provides is the holy grail for the live music industry. Ian says: "It is about bringing 21st Century technology to the live music industry." Based in the Hoxton area of east London, the other, and currently larger, part of Songkick's business is a notification system that means music fans can avoid missing out on seeing their favourite band or singer perform live. Free to use for the consumer, it sends you an alert when a band or singer you like is about to release tickets for a tour due to visit a city or town near you. You can then buy the tickets via Songkick, which takes a commission of up to 10% from the promoter. Songkick's technology means that the user doesn't have to enter a list of bands and singers that he or she likes, as instead it automatically checks your digital music collection, and what you listen to on streaming services such as Spotify. Ian and his two co-founders started the company when he was just 25. Now six years later, it is a global operation used by eight million people per month. For Ian, a Londoner who studied engineering and software at Cambridge University, it was working in California's Silicon Valley that made him realise you are never too young to launch a new technology company. "Living in the Valley for a year was a really influential experience," he says. "The head of data at Facebook at the time was my age. It helped me realise that you could just go for it and start a business if you were interested in solving a particular problem. "The actual idea came from my co-founder Michelle You, we are both really big gig-goers, and she said, 'Is there a way to use technology to make it easier to know when a band you like is going on tour?' "I had the tech background to say 'yes it can be done', and Songkick came from there." Ian says he "always wanted to build something". "It didn't have to be a company, an invention would have done. I'm always most excited when making something." But after graduating, Ian's love of music and China initially saw him spend a year in Beijing, learning Mandarin and earning money as a DJ playing hip-hop. It was also in Beijing that he first met Californian Michelle You, who was a fellow pupil at the same language class. They both kept in touch when they left China, with Ian working in Silicon Valley for management consultants Bain & Company, and Michelle in New York. After Michelle questioned how technology could be used to better used to find out about forthcoming concerts, the idea for Songkick was born. Quitting their day jobs together with third co-founder Pete Smith, a friend of Ian's since Cambridge, they set up the company, initially using their own money. Ian says that while he and his colleagues could have based Songkick in California, they chose London because: "It is the gig capital of the world. London has more concerts than anywhere else." He says the company is proud to be doing its bit to help the wider music industry. "The music industry has been through a huge amount of change in recent years. Not helped by illegal downloads, sales have fallen sharply. "So now bands make 70% of their income from touring. But at the same time, on average, half of all concert tickets go unsold. Songkick is helping sell those spare tickets." Now backed by venture capital funding, including $10m (£6.4m) last year from Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley firm that has previously funded the likes of Google, Apple and PayPal, Songkick still has just 30 members of staff. "We are a small team, but the important thing is the talent density - our staff are extremely talented," says Ian. And while he says he finds it difficult not to spend all his time thinking about the company, he is happy to delegate. "I see my job as attracting exceptional people to solve problems, and then getting out of the way to let them do it." Ian now intends to grow Songkick's business tenfold over the next five years, and is relaxed about the possibility of the established ticket agencies doing something similar to both its core business and new Detour operation. He says: "Our biggest competitors are the ones you don't know about - the three people in a bedroom coming at it from a completely different angle."

Scores more are still missing in Teluk Wondama district after flash floods and landslides that were triggered when a river burst its banks. Hundreds of people have been injured and more than 5,000 are being housed in tents set up in emergency camps. The National Search and Rescue Agency and military have sent reinforcements to help deal with the disaster. The sudden flooding on Monday caught residents by surprise, officials said, contributing to the high death toll. The local airport has now reopened and roads have been largely cleared of debris, which is helping to speed up aid deliveries to the area, reports say. Navy warships had previously been used to carry tents, medical supplies and food to the disaster zone. Thousands of buildings, roads and bridges in five villages have been damaged or destroyed. The head of the the provincial relief agency, Dortheis Sawaki, said 104 bodies had been recovered, but many more people were missing and the death toll was expected to rise. "It's a tragedy. The smell of rotting corpses is everywhere. Power is down. There's no clean water," she was quoted by AP as saying. Many parts of the country had been badly hit by heavy rains, winds and high waves this year, meteorologists said.	More than 100 people are now known to have died in flooding in the eastern Indonesian province of West Papua.
The operation took four hours. IS continued to fire mortars at the airport from further inside the city after losing the ground to the army. The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS, but BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It's a large piece of land, and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The assault began with overnight air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants who had holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told AP, without specifying their nationality. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city, amid reports that they could number up to 650,000. More than 160,000 people have already fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. All bridges linking the east and west of the city, across the Tigris river, have been destroyed by air strikes. IS jihadists overran Mosul as they spread across much of northern and western Iraq in 2014.	Iraqi security forces have recaptured Mosul airport, a key part of the government's offensive to drive the so-called Islamic State (IS) from the western half of the city.
It followed soon after an apparent  industrial relations dispute at De La Salle college in Andersonstown. It is understood on Wednesday, more than 25 teachers out of a teaching staff of about 70 called in sick. It is believed a dispute at the school, which has about 1,000 pupils, centres on an incident prior to half-term. Many of the teachers are said to be concerned over the way it was handled and sent a letter to the principal. At one point, for a brief time, a large number of teachers stood silently at the doors of classrooms. A staff meeting on Monday, when no pupils were in the school, has been described as robust. So far, there has been little comment from teaching unions. INTO, which represents most teachers in the school, said that it and other unions are attempting to resolve what it described as an "industrial relations issue". It is understood that about 15 teachers called in sick on Friday. The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools has said there will be meetings next week involving it and the Board of Governors and unions.	About a third of the teaching staff at one of west Belfast's biggest secondary schools called in sick one day this week, the BBC understands.
The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. "Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes," he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. "Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from," he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work "any monkey" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. "I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution," he said of the synthetic microbes. "If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide."	"Maverick" is a word that seems to follow Craig Venter around.
David Mackintosh, Conservative MP for Northampton South, announced his decision ahead of a local party meeting where his candidacy was expected to be opposed. The BBC reported millions of pounds of public money loaned to Northampton Town FC appeared to have vanished. The MP has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Mackintosh was criticised over the loan to Northampton Town Football Club from the borough council - when he was leader - to rebuild Sixfields stadium and develop nearby land. About £10.25m of that money is now missing and the loan is subject to a police investigation into "alleged financial irregularities". The football stand remains half built. When contacted by the BBC last week, a majority of his party's local executive council said they would vote to deselect him. Mr Mackintosh had previously said he intended to stand for re-election. But in a statement, he said: "It has been a huge honour to be the member of Parliament since 2015, but I now feel it is the right time for my constituents to have a new representative."	An MP facing deselection after being criticised over his role in a loan to a football club will not stand for re-election.
With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: "We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. "We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it." At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, "proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's "narcissistic" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to "trophy woman" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. "Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile." He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says "did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency". "The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency." In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. "The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue." The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: "The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food." Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: "I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay â‚¬20,000 (Â£17,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.  According to the former adviser, only Carla Bruni ever cashed her cheque.	The poisonous memoirs of a right-wing adviser at the Elysee Palace are proving deeply embarrassing for ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, just as he gathers strength for a planned presidential comeback.
Divers found the juvenile's bones by chance in a vast, flooded limestone chamber on the Yucatan Peninsula. Aged 15 or 16 at death, the girl lived at least 12,000 years ago. Researchers have told Science Magazine her DNA backs the idea that the first Americans and modern Native American Indians share a common ancestry. This theory argues that people from Siberia settled on the land bridge dubbed Beringia that linked Asia and the Americas some 20,000 years ago before sea levels rose. These people then moved south to populate the American continents. The genetics of modern Native Americans would certainly appear to link them into this story. But their facial features set them apart from the oldest skeletons now being unearthed. These ancient people had narrower, longer skulls. The differences have hinted that perhaps there were multiple immigrations from Siberia (or even Europe). However, the remains of the Yucatan girl, dubbed Naia - which means "water nymph" in Greek - does not follow that line of thinking, because although she had the slender features associated with the earliest Americans, her DNA shares commonalities with modern Native Americans. Lab analysis of teeth and bone samples link her to a particular genetic lineage known as Haplogroup D1. This same marker is found in substantial numbers of modern Native Americans. "This lineage is thought to have developed in Beringia, the land that now lies beneath the Bering Sea after its ice age occupants became genetically isolated from the rest of Asia," explained lead author Dr Jim Chatters. "Thus, Naia, one of the earliest occupants of the Americas yet found, suggests that Paleoamericans do not represent an early migration from a part of the world different than that of the Native Americans. "Rather, Paleoamericans and Native Americans descended from the same homeland in Beringia. "The differences between them likely arose from evolution that occurred after the Beringian gene pool became separated from the rest of the world." The Yucatan Peninsula is famous for its giant limestone sinkholes, or cenotes. The chamber where the girl was found represents one of these pits before its roof has collapsed to produce a wide surface opening. To reach the natural amphitheatre, divers had to swim almost 1km (0.6 miles) through a water-filled tunnel. "The moment we entered inside, we knew it was an incredible place," recalled Alberto Nava. "The floor disappeared under us and we could not see across to the other side. We pointed our lights down and to the side; all we could see was darkness. "We felt as if our powerful underwater lights were being destroyed by this void. So we called it 'black hole', which in Spanish is 'Hoyo Negro'." Scientists can only speculate as to why Naia had been in the cavern. Skeletal remains of many animals also litter the pit's floor. The suspicion is that they all were looking for water, because the region had a very dry climate 12,000 years ago and the cavern would have been mostly dry but for a few pools. Perhaps they stumbled and fell to their death in the darkness. "Her pelvis is broken and it appears to have been broken at or around the time of her death because it's fractured in a way that relatively young bone would break rather than ancient bone," said Dr Chatters. "So, it appears she fell quite a distance and struck something hard. I think she died almost instantly, if not instantly." On the face of it, the new study supports research published in February that looked at the genetics of an infant who died at about the same time in what is now the US State of Montana. This investigation of "Anzick" boy, as he has become known, was conducted on the main DNA material found in the nuclei of the cells. Naia's DNA, on the other hand, was sourced from outside the nuclei of her cells - in structures called the mitochondria. These carry much more limited information. Dr Shane Doyle from Montana State University said Dr Chatters' team therefore still had some ground to travel before very robust conclusions could be drawn. "In my view they have a way to go before they can say anything substantial," he told BBC News. "It's extremely difficult to get at the nuclear DNA and decoding it is very complex, but this is what they need to do. Until they do that, they cannot tell us a lot about where Native American Indians came from." Dr Chatters confirmed that unravelling Naia's nuclear genome was a future priority.

Writing on his Instagram account, the singer explained he was "taking the opportunity of not having to be anywhere... to travel the world". He also confirmed to fans that his third album is "on its way" and "is the best thing I have made thus far". Sheeran has 16 million Twitter and 5.5 million Instagram followers. He has just completed a world tour of his number one album x (pronounced "multiply") in Auckland, New Zealand. Before the final show, he also tweeted that he was "buggering off for a while". His world tour saw him play three sold out dates at London's Wembley Stadium. His second album x topped the chart in the UK, Australia and the US and was nominated for album of the year at the Grammys. It won the Brit award in the same category. Sheeran recently set up his own label, Gingerbread Man Records, and signed newcomer Jamie Lawson - whose album topped the UK chart - and Northern Irish singer Foy Vance.	Singer Ed Sheeran has announced he is "taking a break" from social media as he is "seeing the world through a screen and not my eyes".
The code received widespread support during consultation and was unanimously approved by the Scottish Parliament. It was introduced following concerns over the number of people being searched without a legal basis. The code says statutory searches must be "necessary, proportionate and in accordance with the law". There is also specific guidance on dealing with children and vulnerable adults. Non-statutory or "consensual" stop-and-searches are now banned entirely. The new code was drawn up by an advisory group led by John Scott QC. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "The ability of police to stop and search individuals can be an intrusion into liberty and privacy, but remains a valuable tool in combating crime. "I have spent some time with police officers using the new code on our streets and am in no doubt that such searches will be carried out with fairness, integrity and respect. "The views expressed during the consultation period were absolutely key to shaping the new code." The code states that stopping and searching must be done for a good reason and be both "necessary and proportionate". This means that officers must have a "reasonable suspicion" based on "facts, information and/or intelligence" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item. Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said: "Police Scotland welcomes the introduction of the code and has worked closely with the Scottish government to support its development. "It provides clear guidance to all our officers and places the rights of the individuals at the centre of any decision to carry out a search. "In preparation for the introduction of the code, all frontline officers have received training and we will continue to work closely with partners, particularly children and young people, to monitor its impact."	A new code of practice on police stop-and-search powers has come into force.
South Wales Fire and Rescue said its crews tackled the blaze throughout the night at the former White Hart Pub on Newbridge Road, Pontllanfraith. They were called to the premises in the Sirhowy Valley village at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday. Fire crews were back at the scene on Sunday checking for any hotspots after extinguishing the flames. A joint investigation with police is now under way to establish how the fire was started, and who was responsible.	A fire at a disused pub in Caerphilly county was set deliberately, firefighters have said.
The contractor, Smartty's Management Limited, has been asked to return the excess payment, the government said. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Dzifa Attivor resigned following a public outcry over the deal. Ghana is struggling with a large budget deficit and a widening public debt. The branding involved respraying the 116 imported passenger buses and adding portraits of the current President John Mahama, his three immediate predecessors and Ghana's first head of state, Kwame Nkrumah. A proper procurement method was "not followed and the contract did not ensure value for money," the government said after a review by Attorney General Marietta Brew Appiah-Opong. Opposition and anti-corruption campaigners have raised concerns over the amount spent, which they said was far too much, forcing the presidency to set up an investigation. The BBC's Sammy Darko in the capital, Accra, says many people think the government is not doing enough to tackle budget mismanagement. They want to see people being charged for causing financial loss to the state, he adds. Mrs Attivor's resignation is the first by a Ghanaian minister in more than a decade and comes amid efforts by the government to cut spending as it implements a three-year International Monetary Fund plan to restore fiscal stability. Earlier this week, Mr Mahama banned public officials, including ministers, from first class air travel and he suspended non-essential trips.	Ghana has demanded a $500,000 (£350,000) refund after its transport ministry spent $1m to paint more than 100 buses with portraits of the country's recent leaders.
Peter Ward, 54 of Barnstaple in Devon and Richard Hiley, 30 of Tividale in the West Midlands were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday. Ward was given five years and two months, Hiley five years. The pair pleaded guilty to possession, supply and importation of Class A and Class B drugs. Peter Ward was known online as PlutoPete. His business specialised in supplying military-grade foil packaging that claimed to hide illegal materials from detection. He also provided new psychoactive substances, commonly known as legal highs. He was arrested by National Crime Agency officers in Barnstaple in October 2013 following an international operation targeting prominent vendors on dark web marketplaces like Silk Road. Officers searched Ward's rural home and found class A and B drugs and numerous computers. Analysis uncovered his close working with an ex-customer, Richard Hiley, who was commissioned by Ward to convert bitcoins into cash. In December 2013, NCA officers raided Hiley's address in the West Midlands after financial records seized from Ward identified large scale transactions between the pair. Hiley also pleaded guilty to two counts of importing a prohibited weapon after he imported five stun guns. He said they were for personal protection. NCA Branch Commander, Ian Glover, said: "Criminals and their customers like to think that dark web market places provide an anonymous haven. "The reality is that law enforcement works together internationally to identify and pursue these people." Source: US Department of Justice	A major vendor on the illegal Silk Road website and his business partner, were sentenced to five years in prison for drugs offences.
Officers fired tyre-deflation rounds at the raiders' Mercedes after they tried to ram a police car to escape. Two further rounds were discharged at another car which was mistakenly thought to be involved. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) said the officers' response was "wholly justified." No members of the public were injured during the incident on 12 February last year. The five men were arrested outside the restaurant after stealing an ATM in Carnoustie earlier that day. Seven men were convicted of blowing up cash machines at banks and supermarkets across England and Scotland at Liverpool Crown Court this week. The Pirc report said the police firearms response was "necessary and proportionate" due to the high risk posed to the public. Commissioner Kate Frame said: "The police response, to what was a significant threat to public safety and the officers themselves, was wholly justified. "They had reliable intelligence to indicate they were dealing with suspects who had access to firearms, a history of extreme violence and who had previously used high-powered stolen vehicles to ram police vehicles and escape. "When the suspects then used the same dangerous tactic to try and avoid arrest during this incident, the use of tyre deflation rounds to disable their vehicle was not only necessary but proportionate."	Police firearms officers who cornered an ATM theft gang at an Arbroath McDonald's restaurant shot at a car not involved in the crime, it has emerged.
Mooboo Bubble Tea - which sells the Taiwanese drink topped with tapioca balls - was attacked on social media and by campaign groups. A petition to demand it pay staff properly collected more than 40,000 signatures. In a statement, Mooboo said trainees would now be paid "company set levels". Emails outlining the original terms were leaked to campaign organisation 38 Degrees. Gordon Maloney from the group said it was an "outrageous way for MooBoo Bubble Tea to exploit people looking for work". He welcomed the "turnaround" but said it was "very important to us that people who have worked for the chain for free under this policy should also be recompensed". The company has branches in London, Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Gateshead, Hatfield, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow. Successful interview applicants were offered 40 hours training, but warned this did not guarantee a job. Mooboo said in a statement: "In view of the recent feedbacks, we are prepared to implement a new training process which all trainees will be paid according to our company set levels once the trainee has entered into our training contract." It later confirmed to campaign group Betterthanzero that all staff would be paid at least the minimum wage from "the first hour". The furore over the training contract led to other cafes being confused with the firm. Bubble Boba in Coventry "suffered vandalism to our shop, slander and abuse to our staff", it said. Directors Neil and Kristin McCoy-Ward said it was now "Mooboo's duty to set the example and follow UK regulations and pay bubble tea artists correctly for their work".	A cafe criticised for making trainees work unpaid for 40 hours, without a guaranteed job, has given in to public pressure.
The hosts were on course for the second highest chase in women's Twenty20 internationals before rain intervened. Sarah Taylor (66) top-scored in England's 156-6 but Dane van Niekerk hit 63 as South Africa reached 145-3 when the match was called off. England, who had never lost a T20 to South Africa before this match, dropped Van Nierkerk on 6 and 22. Van Nierkerk's 63 came off 43 balls, hitting seven fours and two sixes, as she put on 68 with captain Mignon du Preez. That partnership took South Africa to 98-1, but Du Preez scored 47 not out and Marizanne Kapp 21 to take South Africa home. England will rue their missed chances in the South Africa innings when a sloppy fielding performance saw them drop a number of catches, leak runs and miss run-out chances. Taylor scored 66 from 52 balls for England, with eight fours, her second half-century of the series after her unbeaten 74 in England's win in Paarl. Taylor had partnerships of 63 with Heather Knight (29) and 61 with captain Charlotte Edwards (34) but England struggled to kick on in the latter overs. Despite late hitting from Danielle Wyatt, who scored 17 not out, England lost two wickets to run-outs in the final over in which they scored just four runs. England captain Charlotte Edwards: "I thought we batted well and that should have been enough. We were undone by a brilliant innings by Van Niekerk and dropped catches cost us. "We let ourselves down a little bit, but Dane really took the attack to us. We must take our chances." South Africa captain Mignon Du Preez: "We knew that we had the firepower in the line-up, even though we had to go at eight an over. The momentum is with us so we're looking forward to a very competitive game at the Wanderers." Dane van Niekerk: "I enjoyed myself at the top of the order. I did things differently than yesterday and it came up. I'm hitting the ball well." Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent: "England bowled poorly and dropped catches and weren't up to standard. If they play at their best they will be fine because they have talented players such as Sarah Taylor, but they need to work on their game for the World Twenty20." Both sides travel to the Wanderers for Sunday's series decider which gets underway at 8:00 GMT. Sunday's match is both teams' last before the World Twenty20 in India which starts on 15 March, with England beginning their campaign against Bangladesh in Bangalore on 17 March.	South Africa beat England by 17 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method to level the Twenty20 series with one game to go.
Media playback is not supported on this device "You're not wanted any more" rang around Cherry Red Records Stadium in Kingston as the home supporters put their own twist on Gerrard's decision to decline a new Liverpool contract and move to the United States next summer. Liverpool's followers were only too happy to offer the conflicting view - and no wonder after their 34-year-old captain once again dragged them out of hazardous terrain to safety almost single-handed with both goals in this 2-1 FA Cup third round win. If Gerrard needed - not that he does - to build a monument to what Liverpool will miss when he goes, this was the perfect template and left the questions hanging in the air. Gerrard's departure next May has been presented by Liverpool and the player himself as the right time for the parting of the ways. This iconic captain's future would have been carefully managed had he stayed another year, with his number of performances inevitably reduced. It seems Gerrard does not want, or indeed deserve, to close out his magnificent career with a lengthy spell of bench-warming. It is tempting to use every significant Gerrard intervention as part of the case for the prosecution to accuse Liverpool of failing to do enough to keep him - and even this superb performance should be placed in the context that it was with a middling League Two team in opposition. And would he be able to sustain this level of performance and energy, especially in a more advanced role, on a weekly basis in the Premier League into next season? Valid questions but questions Liverpool's fans were prepared to set to one side on Monday. Even now, with the credits rolling on his Liverpool career, they still have no-one like Gerrard who can give them hope when it seems lost, such as against FC Basel with his late free-kick on the night they went out of the Champions League, or here against AFC Wimbledon, when he produced yet again when matters were starting to look extremely difficult. Jordan Henderson is Gerrard's successor-in-waiting as Liverpool captain but does not yet come within light years of the impact the current incumbent has either on the field or off. He is still a developing player and personality so it is actually a tough comparison, but how can he, or indeed anyone else, follow Gerrard as a leader in battle, a figure afforded total respect (perhaps even fear when it comes to opponents) off the field or as a symbol for the fans? Whether Liverpool like it or not, this debate will run and run until the day Gerrard walks out of Anfield for the final time and perhaps even beyond - it was certainly raging on Monday night. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher, who feels aggrieved that the midfielder has somehow been allowed to drift away from Anfield, tweeted on his @Carra23 account: "If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak." Carragher had earlier tweeted: "Liverpool struggled for goals this season. Their top scorer is going to the MLS next season!" Even QPR striker Charlie Austin tweeted: "How can Liverpool let this man go?" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the subject of lavish praise in Gerrard's abdication speech, with the player saying he wished he had worked under the manager a decade ago, but there is no doubt there will be questions for the club's owners and executive staff every time he affects events as he did against AFC Wimbledon. Gerrard's former Liverpool team-mate and room-mate Danny Murphy told BBC Sport on Match of the Day: "Liverpool are very fortunate they've got Steven Gerrard as his two bits of quality have been the difference between the sides and not much else." And Alan Shearer added: "There was one guy who dragged Liverpool through by the scruff of the neck. How many times have we said this over the years? It was his performance, his goals, his work-rate, his effort." Shearer also drew the parallel with Chelsea's decision to let Frank Lampard go, only to see him turn up at Manchester City as a danger to his old club's Premier League title chances. Gerrard has made it clear he will never play against Liverpool but Shearer added: "I just wonder whether Chelsea look at the Frank Lampard situation and just wish that they hadn't let him go. I wonder if Liverpool will do the same." The bottom line is that no matter how much Liverpool look to the future, the player and inspiration they still rely on is Steven Gerrard. For that overall impact on games, his colleagues and his club, he will be impossible to replace. Liverpool's debt to Gerrard was placed in even sharper relief by the fact it allowed them to secure an FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers despite seeing the usual fault lines exposed by AFC Wimbledon. After Gerrard put Liverpool ahead in the 12th minute, there was a period of relative calm as Neil Ardley's side were subdued and the Premier League giants looked in control. It did not last long as Liverpool's defence came under pressure and, as it has done so often this season, almost instantly looked incapable of coping. Sean Rigg had already missed one good chance before he forced a save from Simon Mignolet and it was alarming to see how a routine kick from AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea created various degrees of panic and a chance that Matt Tubbs wasted. Wimbledon's equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa was Liverpool's defence in microcosm. Mignolet flapped hopelessly at George Francomb's corner under pressure, Mamadou Sakho bundled the ball against his own bar and amid the carnage Akinfenwa reacted first. Mignolet, only restored in goal because of an injury to his journeyman deputy Brad Jones, was taunted throughout by AFC Wimbledon fans well-versed in his problems with the ball at his feet. If Liverpool could get their hands on a goalkeeper of quality as a long-term replacement for Mignolet this month surely they will, although it could prove easier said than done. Mignolet may have to do for this season but not beyond. Rodgers works on defensive organisation and is certainly too skilled and confident a coach to bring in an outsider to assist with defence, but that vulnerability must remain a concern. As he pointed out when Arsenal scored at Anfield recently, it is not a matter of coaching or organisation when three one-on-one headers are lost in Liverpool's own penalty area. The current players simply need to be better - or replaced by better players. Much was made of the memories of the original Wimbledon FC's FA Cup Final win against Liverpool at Wembley in 1988 as the sub-plot to this occasion - and it was right that two of the real heroes of that day and the old "Crazy Gang" were on hand for this tie in the shape of goalkeeper and captain Dave Beasant and goalscorer Lawrie Sanchez. This, though, is a different time and a different era - as well as a different club for the fans who have helped the rebirth of AFC Wimbledon after they started the long road back in the Combined Counties League in 2002 before going through five promotions and a return to the Football League in 2011. And this FA Cup night was a credit to the way this club has been reshaped and the passion of those loyal fans. Neil Ardley's team were honest, committed and did themselves and AFC Wimbledon proud on their big night. There are still further steps for AFC Wimbledon to take, perhaps even back to their old Plough Lane home, but for now this is a good news story for everyone involved. The FA Cup provides tales to tell for all involved - not just for clubs but for the media following the progress of this wonderful competition. Sunday's tie between Yeovil Town and Manchester United involved a temporary home in the front row of The Screwfix Community Stand, where you could almost reach out and touch the action at ground level. Cut to Cherry Red Records Stadium a short walk from Norbiton Station 24 hours later and home was a specially built overflow press box in a corner of the stadium, access gained by climbing a rather shaky ladder. All good fun - especially for the unsporting AFC Wimbledon fans who subjected Her Majesty's Media to (to put it politely) to catcalls as they made an inelegant exit down the ladder before leaving to hear from Neal Ardley and Brendan Rodgers. The chants of 'You don't know what you're doing" were not entirely inaccurate but given (and taken) in good part. The FA Cup third round is still one of the great dates in English football's calendar - and anyone wishing to argue against that could not have been present at Yeovil or AFC Wimbledon.	When Steven Gerrard suffered a rare blemish in the middle of his latest masterclass, AFC Wimbledon's fans pounced on the topic that will dominate Liverpool's agenda between now and the day he takes his leave.
Boyce, 27, who had a couple of spells with Glentoran, had spent this season on loan at Dungannon Swifts after being put on the transfer list at Coleraine. Last June, Coleraine boss Oran Kearney said Boyce was not in his plans and the player was not given a squad number. "We are delighted to get someone of Darren's ability," said Ballymena United manager Glenn Ferguson. "He will add quality to our front line and score goals." Earlier this week, Ballymena signed former Linfield defender Jim Ervin, also on a 30-month deal. United said both players would be eligible to make their Sky Blues debuts in Saturday's Irish Cup fifth round match away to Championship One side H&W Welders. The match at Tillysburn has a 13:30 GMT kick-off. Meanwhile, on Thursday night, Linfield midfielder Brian McCaul signed for Glenavon. McCaul was Linfield's top scorer last season but had not commanded a regular place this term. He had previously been at Glenavon on loan and has signed an 18-month deal at Mourneview Park.	Ballymena have announced the signing of winger Darren Boyce from Coleraine on a two-and-a-half year contract.
The former Celtic defender has left his role as a youth coach at Everton to take the job. He replaces Terry Butcher, who was sacked following Hibs' relegation from the Premiership last season. "To be given this opportunity with Hibernian is a great privilege and a real honour - it is a massive club with huge potential," said the 42-year-old. Stubbs has been appointed on a two-year contract and will be hoping to lead the Easter Road side back to the top flight at the first attempt, with Edinburgh rivals Hearts and Rangers also in the second tier next term. A decision has yet to be made on his assistant. "I'm excited about the future here at Hibernian and what we can all achieve together at the club - this is the start of the journey," he added. "The Scottish Championship will be a tough division, but I'm confident that if we approach the challenge with enthusiasm, optimism and belief then we can achieve success. He is a driven, intelligent and strong-minded character, who has a very clear vision about what he wants to achieve in football "I've been at Everton for almost six years and now I believe I'm ready to take on the role of head coach here at Hibernian." Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster revealed her delight at the appointment, insisting the Englishman shares her vision for the club. "There were strong candidates who applied for the position but after much consideration, Alan emerged as the standout choice," she said. "It's important that the CEO and head coach are very much on the same page and that they forge a close working and trusting partnership. I spoke with Alan and it became apparent early in the discussions that we had a common goal. "He is a driven, intelligent and strong-minded character, who has a very clear vision about what he wants to achieve in football - producing positive results, playing attractive football and developing young players. "All those attributes fitted the criteria we required and we're confident Alan is the right man to unite the club and bring success to Hibernian. "Alan will be our head coach and that is part of the new structure in place at the football club; a continental-style model designed for continued long-term success."	Alan Stubbs has been named the new head coach of Scottish Championship side Hibernian.

Fifty sheep were stolen from a farm in Ammanford and the farmer spotted a flock two weeks later at a livestock market in Llanybydder. After the ewes gave birth, paternity tests revealed they were the offspring of the farmer's rams. Andrew Thomas, 39, of Garnant admitted handling the stolen sheep. He will be sentenced at Swansea Crown Court this month. Dyfed-Powys Police said this was the first time DNA evidence has been used in a case of this type in Wales, and only the third time across Wales and England. Insp Matthew Howells said: "Traditionally, sheep rustling cases are very difficult to detect and prosecute, with this case being no exception. "Although we were unable to prove who stole the sheep, we were able to use forensic techniques usually reserved for humans to help prove that the sheep were in fact the stolen ones."	A Carmarthenshire sheep rustler has been convicted after police used DNA testing on lambs for the first time in Wales.
Chancellor George Osborne said the plan, requiring governments "in normal times" to spend less than they get in tax, represented "economic sanity". Labour voted against the Conservatives' Charter for Budget Responsibility, but 21 of their MPs abstained. It came as shadow chancellor John McDonnell said his decision to reverse Labour's stance was "embarrassing". The charter, an amended version of which was set out in July's Budget, passed comfortably by a majority of 62 despite being opposed by the SNP, the Lib Dems and the majority of Labour MPs. But the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said former shadow ministers Tristram Hunt, Chis Leslie, Shabana Mahmood and Liz Kendall were among 21 MPs to have defied the leadership by abstaining while a further 16 MPs were given permission to be absent by Labour whips. The charter would legally force future governments to run an absolute budget surplus - which involves spending less than they receive in tax revenue - when the economy is growing. After several days of criticism of his handling of the issue, Mr McDonnell sought to explain his position, saying that while tackling the deficit was "vitally important", the charter was a "puerile political stunt" and "an instrument for imposing austerity on our community unnecessarily". Having previously said Labour would give it its backing, Mr McDonnell informed a stormy meeting of Labour MPs on Monday that he had changed his mind - and told the party to oppose it. Justifying his decision in the Commons, he admitted the U-turn was politically "embarrassing" but insisted a "bit of humility among politicians does not go amiss". However, he insisted he had changed his mind on Parliamentary tactics, not economic policy, and that by voting against the framework, Labour would "disassociate itself" from a plan that he suggested was merely cover for spending cuts and an "assault" on the welfare state. What's George Osborne proposing? "I want to break the stranglehold that the focus on deficits has had on the economic debate in this country in recent years," he said. "Yes the deficit is vitally important but we need a paradigm shift to open up the wider debate about what makes a health economy." The proposed rules were not "economic instruments but political weapons", he said, claiming that Mr Osborne had treated his existing budgetary framework "with contempt" and was unlikely to adhere to them. "When the circumstances and judgement change, it is best to admit to it and change as well," he said, adding that he had been influenced by "professional advice" he had received, a change in the economic outlook and the plight of the Redcar steelworkers. The 21 Labour MPs who abstained But Mr Osborne said the UK must "live within its means" and help equip the UK economy to withstand future economic shocks, arguing that if the UK could not manage to get control of its deficit and debt by 2019, after nine years of successive growth, when would it be able to do this. He accused Labour of being "profligate" and wanting "to spend money we don't have and borrow for ever". "It is not a political gimmick to have sound public finances," he said. "I tell you what is a political gimmick - coming out on the eve of your conference with some policy suggesting you support what we are doing and two weeks later turning up in the House of Commons and voting against it". Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, one of those Labour MPs who abstained, told MPs that the party "should not set its face" against a surplus but said the proposal would not give Mr Osborne sufficient room for manoeuvre in the event of a downturn. The UK has run a budget surplus in only 12 years since 1948. Critics have dismissed the charter as a "gimmick" that will either bind the hands of future governments or have so may exemptions to be pointless -  and Mr Osborne himself described similar legislation introduced by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as "vacuous and irrelevant" in 2010.	MPs have backed the government's new spending rules by 320 to 258 votes after a heated debate in the Commons.
If you have eaten a handful of spicy chicken wings in Angola recently or perhaps polished off a lemony "yassa poulet" in Senegal, there is a good chance your chicken travelled some distance before finding its way on to your plate. It depends where you live in Africa, but chickens are increasingly migrating - in freezers - from Brazil, Germany or other European Union countries to the continent. Imports of chicken to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to figures from the US Department of Agriculture. Here's a look at reasons behind the huge increase and what can be done to help fatten up the continent's poultry industry - in four points: 1) Why chickens not cows? Africa has a growing population, which is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, and with that has come an increased demand for the consumption of meat, of one variety in particular. "Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans," says Kevin Lovell, chief executive of the South Africa Poultry Association. The higher cost of beef and some of the religious restrictions around pork in parts of Africa help explain the preference for chicken, he says. As more people move to the city, their dietary patterns begin to change and they are more likely to choose meat from a local fast food joint, or one of the global chains that have proliferated across the continent in recent years. The fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken now has more than 700 outlets in Africa, operating in 13 countries. "The production of meat has not caught up with the demand... driven both by the rise in the population but also by the urbanisation phenomenon," explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. And the growth really is phenomenal. By 2030, 50% of Africans, numbering more than half a billion, are expected to be living in cities, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Hungry birds Many Africans will be familiar with the "road runner" chicken, which can often be found in the backyard roaming freely. These birds tend to feed themselves and are known for being tough but tasty. As a means to feed the family or make a small income these low-input birds tend to do the job. However, when it comes to intensive farming, a steady supply of chicken feed which is made up of maize and soya is vital. But weak agricultural systems in Africa mean that feed often has to be imported at a high cost, hampering farmers' efforts to ramp up their grain production. Napoleon Oduro, is a Ghanaian poultry and egg farmer with a 500-bird farm, a few hours outside of the capital Accra. He tells me that the imported feed he relies on costs him $25 (Â£20) for a bag of 50kg (110 lb). And with each bird eating about 2.5kg of feed per month, he says costs can quickly become prohibitive. 3) Breeding a "super chicken" It is not just the high cost of feed, but the fact that most African chickens need more of it than their fellow birds in developed markets. African farmers do not have the same access to broiler chickens, birds which are specifically bred and raised for meat consumption. "Many agencies that work in Africa try to come up with what they call locally adapted breeds but it is always a half answer because those birds will never convert animal feed into food as efficiently as the modern improved Western breeds," says Mr Lovell. Prof Juma puts this down to a lack of research facilities, which makes it harder to support breeding programmes on the continent. He cites Kenya, where about 80% of the poultry production is based on less productive traditional breeds, as a prime example of the problem. However, there is some good news on this front. The African Chicken Genetic Gains project is on a mission to bring "more productive chickens to African smallholders". Led by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and backed by the deep pockets of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it aims to improve the genetic makeup of African chickens. The initiative, which is initially being rolled out in  Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania is part of what the Microsoft founder has called his "big bet" on chickens, which also includes a promise to donate 100,000 of the birds to families and communities in the world's poorest nations. Top tips from African chicken farmers: "I started off seven years ago with 400 broilers and 300 layers but I realised that maintaining broilers was more expensive.  Raising feed is also tough, my chickens can consume 300kg of food a day! But from my business I sent my three kids to school and bought a car. Tip: "If you want to start small, start with broilers, they are cheaper and in six weeks you will be selling. And if you are rearing broilers and layers ensure they are kept separately." "Finding a market is a challenge, there are big international companies that flood the market with cheap chickens and stifle local farmers from growing. The cost for feed is high and occasionally thieves break into my pens." Tip:"You can sell your chickens at four weeks, but it is better to wait for six weeks, the meat is better, the chickens heavier." "My local chickens get attacked by eagles and diseases regularly. Getting treatment is not easy. Poor rainfall makes it hard to grow feed. It is available for sale but expensive. But from my business I have sent my two boys to college and two girls to secondary school." Tip: "To protect your chicks from eagles I dye them sky blue to disguise them." "In 2011 I started with 50,000 chickens, my farm has now grown to a company that employs not less than 400 people. We face many challenges - banks are not interested in lending and with the credit crunch, costs for raw materials for our feed have almost doubled." Tip: "Be ready to spend more on chicks from reputable hatchery even if your neighbour's farm is selling cheap chicks." 4) Import dilemma One of the major obstacles for farmers in Africa is the flood of imports from Brazil, Europe and the US. Those working in the African poultry sector put this down to a preference for white meat in Western countries. "In Europe, in particular most people want to eat breast meat and they will pay a lot more for breast meat in a supermarket than they would for dark meat [wings, thighs and legs] and that difference allows the company to make a profit and sell the dark meat for less than it costs to  produce it," says Mr Lovell. "When it gets to South Africa, Ghana, Angola or wherever else in Africa, that causes a problem because the local farmers can't compete." In an attempt to bolster local production, various governments across Africa, including those of Botswana, Nigeria, Namibia and Swaziland, have attempted to address the issue by imposing import restrictions. Botswana, with more than three decades of strong import restrictions on poultry behind it, now produces enough chickens to feed its own people. But it also has the most expensive frozen chicken in the region, according to recent research, with critics calling for the government to open up market up to competition to bring prices down. Mr Oduro has the same problem over prices: "Customers will say that what we produce here in Ghana is expensive as compared to the imported chicken." But the Ghanaian farmer criticises the government for a lack of intervention, saying that it has failed to invest and support his sector for many years. "We are not against imports, we are crying for a policy that will make the Ghanaian farmer competitive." Top farming tips produced by Joab Frank Chakhaza	With a growing appetite for chicken in Africa, BBC Africa's Kim Chakanetsa investigates why the continent does not produce enough birds to feed itself.
It had notified the UN of its intention to leave last October, saying the ICC pursued "regime change". The opposition Democratic Alliance then argued in court that the government had to first seek parliamentary approval. But it may not be the end of the government's bid to leave The Hague-based court. Justice Minister Michael Masutha was quoted as saying after the court ruling in February that the government would consider its options. In the meantime, according to a statement on the UN treaties website, the planned pull out has been officially cancelled. South Africa's original decision to pull out came after a dispute over Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's visit to the country in 2015. The authorities refused to arrest Mr Bashir despite him facing an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. Mr Bashir was attending an AU summit in Johannesburg, when the government ignored an ICC request to arrest him. The ICC has been accused of being biased against Africans. The ICC and global justice: A non-binding African Union resolution agreed in January called for the mass withdrawal of member states from the court, with some countries accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. Last year, Burundi and The Gambia, along with South Africa, also said they would leave the court. But The Gambia, under new President Adama Barrow, has changed its mind.	South Africa has revoked its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after the High Court said the move was unconstitutional.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) made a number of recommendations including ensuring nursing staffing levels were safe at Sandwell General Hospital and City Hospital in Birmingham. It also called for improvements in A&E, medical care and surgery. Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust said it is "working hard already to address the issues". Care at the trust was given an overall rating of "requires improvement". The CQC said: "The trust was rated as 'inadequate' with regard to whether [it] was always providing a service that is safe." Source: CQC inspection between 14-17 and 25-30 October The trust said the report made for  "difficult reading". Chief executive Toby Lewis said: "The areas of improvement identified in the report are not a surprise to us at the trust, even where they are disappointing, or make difficult reading." CQC's chief inspector, Prof Sir Mike Richards, said: "While we witnessed areas of good practice it is clear that the trust has work to do to make improvements which are sustainable long term." Inspectors will return to check whether the necessary changes have taken place and the CQC will continue to monitor the trust "closely". Mr Lewis said: "During the CQC visit, inspectors saw some individual examples of poor practice in some departments around hand washing, security of medicines and completion of patient records." He said these individual examples "are not acceptable" and it is up to the trust leadership to ensure it gets "the basics right, first time, every time for every patient".	The safety of services at a trust running two hospitals has been rated "inadequate" by a health watchdog.
Cornwall Live said its journalists were told they could not broadcast the PM's visit via Facebook Live. The publication, owned by Trinity Mirror, took to social media to vent its frustrations. The Conservatives said the reporters' "last minute" request to film had "not been possible" because a pooled resource had already been agreed. Reporters and broadcasters are traditionally given a pooled resource for video, stills and text at such events. Read more on this story and others from Cornwall Cornwall Live sent two reporters and a photographer to cover the prime minister's visit to Helston. The reporters published a photo of the room they were held in while the PM was interviewed by other media. Editor Jacqui Merrington said they were "a lot more" than a local newspaper. "When we arrived... we were told we were not allowed to film anything because we were invited as print media, which seems a bit 20th Century really." She added: "We are digital media and that is the case for most local media nowadays and to be restricted on that basis seems very archaic." A spokesman for the Conservatives said Cornwall Live only made a request to film on the morning of the visit. "One media organisation's last minute request to add a camera to a pre-arranged pool of broadcast cameras was not possible this morning. "The organisation's journalists did interview the prime minister and their photographer accompanied [her] on a factory tour."	Website reporters covering Theresa May's visit to Cornwall have complained they were not allowed to film her.
The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday. There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme. But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured." Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover. The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership. Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters. He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business. "This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys."	A union has welcomed reassurances from the new owner of Bernard Matthews over job security and pensions.
The 21-time Grand Slam champion was questioned on the issue after her 48-minute 6-2 6-0 Wimbledon semi-final victory against Elena Vesnina. Roger Federer and Andy Murray's Centre Court quarter-finals against Marin Cilic and Jo Wilfried-Tsonga lasted a combined seven hours and 11 minutes. "I don't deserve to be paid less because of my sex," said Williams, 34. The American was asked about equal pay by the media after she swept into her ninth Wimbledon title in under an hour while, on Wednesday, second seed Murray and third seed Federer were both taken to five sets. In March, male world number one Novak Djokovic said men deserved to be paid more because more people watched them. However, the 11-time Grand Slam winner apologised shortly afterwards, saying: "I don't make any differences between the genders. I am for equality in the sport." His comments followed Indian Wells tournament chief Raymond Moore saying the women's game was "riding on the coat tails" of the men's. Moore, who also said female players "should get down on their knees" in thanks to male counterparts, later resigned. "Basically my whole life I've been doing this. I haven't had a life," defending Wimbledon champion Williams said. "I would like to see people - the public, the press, other athletes in general - just realise and respect women for who they are and what we are and what we do." Wimbledon was the last Grand Slam to introduce equal pay in 2007, while the French, US and Australian Slams introduced it in 2006, 1973 and 2001 respectively. Williams will face Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber in the final on Saturday, after the German beat Venus Williams 6-4 6-4 in the other semi-final, in 72 minutes. Kerber said: "We are giving everything on court, everybody. You never know if it's two hours or, at the end, eight hours."	Serena Williams says female tennis players deserve their equal pay, in the latest debate about prize money.
Thousands of sufferers and their dependants will be able to get damages from a £350m pot over the next decade. Those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible. Ministers said it was a "major breakthrough" to "end an injustice". Mesothelioma is a fatal disease with average survival rates of about nine months after diagnosis. It is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation. About 2,400 people die every year of the disease and numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000. While some people have taken legal action to recover damages, many are deterred because of the stress involved. The speed with which the disease takes hold means many die before their cases are heard. Victims and their families have, up to now, been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000. Under the proposed new fund, which must receive parliamentary approval, UK claimants will be entitled to 75% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, expected to be about £115,000. Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer. "This scheme represents a major breakthrough for the many victims of this terrible disease, who have been failed by successive governments and the insurance industry for decades," said Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning. "It will end an injustice that has left many tragic victims and their families high and dry. "The aggressive and terminal nature of this disease, coupled with the fact we're approaching a peak in cases in the coming years, makes it imperative that we get this legislation in place as soon as possible," he added. According to government calculations, 900 people are likely to qualify for support in 2014, with a further 300 expected to get assistance in each of the following nine years. If the Mesothelioma Bill currently before Parliament is passed in the next few months, it is hoped the first payments will be made next July. There has been anger that ministers have proposed a cut-off point for claims and that those diagnosed before 25 July last year, when the scheme was first announced, will not be eligible. Officials have defended the move, saying that an open-ended commitment to compensate all those afflicted by the disease would simply not be affordable. Those suffering from other asbestos-related conditions, such as asbestosis, will also not be eligible. One campaign group said the proposals were a "drastic improvement" on the current support available. But it said the cut-off point seemed "arbitrary and harsh" and some victims felt it was unfair that they were not able to claim 100% of the value of a civil settlement. Mesothelioma often takes 40 to 50 years to manifest itself after exposure and most of those being diagnosed are males in their 60s and older. The scheme will be paid for by the insurance industry. All insurers will have to register on a voluntary database established in 2011 listing employers' liability insurance policies, both current and historic.	Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, will be able to claim far larger compensation under a new fund.
The left-handed opener, 36, who played six Tests for England, last appeared for his county in July 2016 before he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour. He immediately started treatment and had a successful operation. Carberry scored exactly 100 off 121 balls in Hampshire's game against Cardiff MCCU at the Ageas Bowl. Having resumed pre-season training in January and going on a tour of Barbados with the county, Carberry released a statement on Tuesday thanking people for their support and urging the media to continue "respecting my privacy in dealing with my illness". Hampshire begin their County Championship Division One season against Yorkshire at Headingley on Friday.	Michael Carberry scored a century in his first competitive outing for Hampshire since returning to cricket after undergoing treatment for cancer.
Robinson was confronted as the teams left the pitch, and had to be restrained. "This does not reflect well on anyone," said chief executive Erik Samuelson. "Any abusive remark by a volunteer towards an opposition employee is completely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated." Robinson previously spent six years in charge of MK Dons, the club which resulted from Wimbledon FC's relocation from south London to Milton Keynes in September 2003. AFC Wimbledon was formed in 2002 after permission was granted for Wimbledon FC to move, and worked their way up the non-league pyramid before reaching the Football League in 2011. The Addicks boss, 36, told BBC Radio London the comment directed towards him "breaks all boundaries of football". "We were very aware that the presence at the game of Mr Robinson represented a risk, because many of our fans feel he was very disrespectful of our club in his time [at Milton Keynes]," Samuelson added in a statement on the club website. "For that reason we went out of our way to avoid any incidents. We will complete our investigation before reaching a final conclusion." Meanwhile, Wimbledon are also set to investigate a coin-throwing incident from the Charlton supporters' area, which resulted in an assistant referee being hit on the back of the head. Samuelson said the League One club are studying CCTV footage, to identify who committed what he described as a "reckless act".	AFC Wimbledon will investigate an incident between a club volunteer and Charlton boss Karl Robinson at the end of Saturday's 1-1 draw.
The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should "apologise to the fans". "It didn't really work for me," Horner added. "We have not really put on a show. "To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong." Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: "It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back." Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: "I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. "It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said." The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: "I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. "I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good. I felt like James Brown at the end of the lap." Vettel added: "We expected them to be stronger in qualifying, which they were. Very happy with the lap in the end so we saved a set for the race. We still have high hopes for tomorrow and it is a long year." Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz were fifth and seventh, split by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10. McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button took 12th and 13th, a huge improvement on their dismal 2015, and Briton Jolyon Palmer 14th for Renault on his grand prix debut, ahead of team-mate and former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen.

The man, who has not yet been formally identified, was discovered in a wooded area near the Goodwyns housing estate in Dorking on Monday. Surrey Police has been given more time to question a 21-year-old male arrested on suspicion of murder. The force is awaiting the results of a post-mortem examination.	Extra time has been granted to detectives quizzing a murder suspect over the discovery of a body in a stream.
Baxter, 24, played the last of his 93 league games for United in February, with the ex-Everton trainee then banned for an unspecified reason by the club. In July 2015 he was suspended by the Football Association for failing an out-of-competition drugs test. Midfielder Ryan Flynn, 24, who scored 13 goals in 153 league games, has also been released. Meanwhile, Dean Hammond, who made 34 Blades appearances during his loan spell from Leicester City in the 2015-16 season, has activated a clause in his contract to remain at Bramall Lane on a permanent deal. However, the 33-year-old has immediately been placed on the transfer list alongside Kieron Freeman, Kieran Wallace, James Wallace, Paul Coutts, Martyn Woolford and Diego De Girolamo. Goalkeeper George Long has been offered a new deal while Alex Baptiste, David Edgar and Conor Sammon have left the club after their loan deals expired. Mark Howard, Bob Harris, Callum McFadzean, Terry Kennedy, Harrison McGahey, Jay McEveley, Florent Cuvelier and Jamal Campbell-Ryce have all been released.	Forward Jose Baxter, who was suspended twice in nine months, is among 10 players released by Sheffield United.
The gunman fled after opening fire on Annonciate Haberisoni as she was waiting for her hair to be done, witnesses said. Mr Rwasa accused the government of attempting to assassinate his wife. It has not commented on the allegation. Tensions have been rising in Burundi ahead of elections in May and June. Mr Rwasa said at a press conference that his wife was being treated for head injuries at a local hospital, and her condition was not critical. He would not be intimidated by Sunday's shooting, he added. Mr Rwasa accused the government of compiling a hit list of people to be targeted in the run-up to parliamentary elections in May and presidential elections in June. Police said they were investigating the attack. Witnesses were quoted in the local media as saying that Mrs Haberisoni's life was probably saved by her hair dresser who saw the gunman taking aim and pushed her out of the way. Mr Rwasa is a former rebel leader and an influential member of the opposition Forces for National Liberation (FNL) party. He came out of hiding in 2013 and said he would contest this year's election. President Pierre Nkurunziza has not yet indicated whether he will step down or run for a third term. He took office in 2005 following the end of a 12-year civil war, which killed more than 300,000 people.	The wife of prominent Burundian opposition politician Agathon Rwasa has been shot and wounded at a hair salon in the capital, Bujumbura.

The unknown offender seized control of the Medway Council feed at about 19:45 BST. Its first tweet announced: "The Medway Council Twitter feed has been taken over by the citizens of Medway." Hackers went on to publish a string of Tweets which were removed about 10 minutes later. The authority apologised for any offence caused. It tweeted: "Our account was hacked for a short time earlier this evening. "Sorry for any offence caused by the tweets which have now been removed." During the security breach, around nine tweets were sent including one which promised: "We're also going to introduce decent schools. About time eh?". The hackers also announced an end to Rochester's Dickens Festival. Celia Glynn-Williams, head of communication at Medway Council, said action was taken to secure the account as quickly as possible. She added: "We are sorry for any offence caused by the messages that were tweeted. "We take the security of our account very seriously and are looking into how this happened."	Hackers have targeted a council Twitter feed - announcing an end to council tax and free parking for all.
Sinead Higgins, 37, and son Oisin O'Driscoll were found after police forced their way into the house in The Fairway, Ruislip, west London on Wednesday. Police responded to concerns for the pair's welfare at about 10:50 GMT. A Met Police spokeswoman said detectives do not believe a third party was involved in the deaths. Det Insp Dave Bolton said: "Inquiries so far lead us to believe there is a likelihood that the tragic events that led to the deaths do not involve a third party." A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Friday. Next of kin have been informed.	The bodies of a mother and her seven-year-old son have been discovered at their home.
US and European bond prices have sunk in expectation that he will enact inflationary policies that speed the pace of interest rate rises. On Monday, some bond yields - which rise as the price falls - hit their highest for more than six months. Bonds globally lost $1.29tn (Â£1tn) last week, according to Bank of America. And there is no sign that the bond sell-off is easing, depressing the value of some pension investments and making it more expensive for countries and companies to borrow money. On Monday, the 30-year US Treasury jumped above 3% for the first time since January. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yields returned to levels not seen since June's Brexit referendum vote. And German 30-year bunds rose above 1% for the first time since early May. Italian bonds have been among the most affected. Rome's 10-year yields rose four basis points to 2.01% on Monday, their highest in 14 months. "It is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the US takes a more expansionary fiscal stance," said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. Jim Cielinski, head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle, said the sell-off trend was not surprising, but the "ferocity of the reversal" was. And in a research note for Societe Generale, analyst Daniel Fermon said that rising interest rates may not be a good thing. "As central banks are now less active in the bond market and Trump expects to cut taxes and launch a $1tn infrastructure investment plan, increasing the deficit, we believe rising US long-term rates remain a major risk for financial markets," he said. Investors had piled into bonds, seeking a safe - but low - rate of return during what has been years of sluggish growth in the US, Europe and Japan. But since inflation and interest rates are seen as likely to rise, investors are seeking assets with a more attractive return. With a Trump administration promising economic stimulus through spending and tax cuts, investors are worried about putting money into low fixed-payment assets, such as bonds. That has fuelled share markets since last Wednesday's election result. Wall Street's Dow Jones index closed at another record high on Friday, in the wake of Mr Trump's unexpected victory. European markets have also risen, and at midday on Monday, the FTSE 100, Cac-40 and Dax were all slightly higher. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei index hitting a nine-month high, closing up 1.7%. Bond yields are up in the eurozone's financially stressed countries, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal and the moves have been quite pronounced over the last few days.  Rising government borrowing costs were one of the central features of the region's financial crisis. So are we are looking at a re-run? There are three important differences to keep in mind. Those borrowing costs are still well below crisis levels. At the time, a rule of thumb for whether a bailout was needed was ten-year government borrowing costs of more than 7%. Italy has just gone over 2%, Portugal is 3.5%. And it's happening to them all. Even ultra-safe Germany has seen its government bond yields rise, although they are much lower than Italy's. And the impetus is coming from outside, from political events in the US. Still, it is clear that Europe still has its weaknesses, especially in some countries' banks - Italy and Germany's Deutsche Bank most notably. The dollar has also strengthened against major currencies. The pound fell 1.1% to $1.2464. Currencies in many emerging markets - from the Mexican peso and Malaysian ringgit, to Turkey's lira and South African rand - fell on fears that protectionism and higher US interest could suck investment from these markets. "Clearly the market has settled on a 'buy dollar' theme, on the basis there will be a debt-fuelled US fiscal binge that will push up inflation," said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin. "There are signs that higher bond yields and the knock of a stronger US dollar are having a domino impact, taking down the weakest risky assets first, before moving on to the next," said Deutsche's global co-head of foreign exchange, Alan Ruskin. And a senior European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that the uncertainty caused by sudden swings in the financial markets threatened economic recovery. Speaking in Frankfurt on Monday, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio said: "We should be cautious in drawing hasty, positive conclusions from those market developments, because they may not necessarily indicate that the world economy will have an accelerating recovery with higher growth."	A wave of selling sweeping across bond markets resumed on Monday as investors continued to digest the impact of a Donald Trump presidency.
The 23 year-old stroked the GB boat to a fast start and they were ahead after 500m but European champions, Romania and New Zealand proved too strong. The Romanians came out on top, with the British eight comfortably holding off the challenge from the Netherlands The GB eight now prepare for the World Championships in Sarasota in September. There was no medal success for Enniskillen's Holly Nixon in the women's quadruple sculls. Nixon and her GB team mates Bethany Bryan, Alice Baatz and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne, were always off the pace and finished fifth in a race won by Poland.	Belfast's Rebecca Shorten won a bronze medal as part of the Great Britain women's eight at the final World Cup regatta of the season in Lucerne.
Administrators' reports suggest around £7m of £10.25m lent to Northampton Town by the local borough Council was passed to 1st Land Limited. A total of £2.65m was then given to David Cardoza and his father, Anthony. David Cardoza declined to comment, saying: "I'm under confidentiality so can't speak." A report from March this year showed a dispute arose between the Cardozas and 1st Land, which has since gone into administration, over the money. The Cardozas called it a "Joint Venture Fee" - money paid to one party to help carry out a jointly-run project - but 1st Land said it was a loan. It is unclear what has since happened to the money. The £10.25m loan was originally paid to the League Two club for the redevelopment of the new East Stand at Sixfields Stadium, along with a hotel and conference centre - none of which have been completed. Contractors Buckingham Group were appointed to carry out the works, with 1st Land appointed to oversee the development. When the company went into administration, it owed Northampton Town £7.3m and Buckingham Group more than £2m. The Cardozas and fellow businessmen, Howard Grossman, his son Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick, feature as directors of several firms with business links to 1st Land and a second company appointed to oversee the development - County Developments (Northampton) Limited or CDNL. Many of these companies have gone into liquidation. Howard Grossman is listed as the only director of 1st Land; which is owned by another Grossman firm, County Group. The administrators' report also lists payments of £314,000 to Howard Grossman for his salary; £1.475m to County Homes (Herts) Ltd and £233,000 to County Cemetery Services Limited. The director of County Homes is also Howard Grossman. County Cemetery Services lists two current directors: Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. David Cardoza was a director of the company until August last year. It has also gone into administration - but not before a sale agreement was made with a company called Centurion Infinity Limited; whose directors are Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick. After the collapse of 1st Land, CDNL took over the job of facilitating the Sixfields development. Its current directors are listed as David and Anthony Cardoza, while Marcus Grossman and Simon Patnick resigned directorships in January. That company has now also entered liquidation. The club faces a winding-up petition, due to be heard on 16 November, from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).	A football club chairman and his father were given a "loan" of more than £2.5m by a company set up to oversee the development of its stadium.
Screen grabs showing the website with messages from gay activists are being circulated on social media sites. In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of "aggravated homosexuality" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a "serial offender" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: "We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today," screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: "Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. "All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs." The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights.	The Ugandan prime minister's website was attacked by hackers on Tuesday and Wednesday, a government official has confirmed to the BBC.
Labour MP Mrs Cox died when she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on Thursday. After her death, her friends set up a fundraising page, with proceeds to be divided between causes she had supported. In a tweet, her husband Brendan said the money would "change lives". The fund was pushed past the seven-figure mark shortly before 20:30 BST on Monday by a single £6,000 donation. More than 30,000 people have donated so far. Money raised will support three charities Mr Cox said were close to his wife's heart - the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets. Mrs Cox's friend Tim Dixon, one of those who launched the fund, said: "The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo's family. "It shows how powerfully Jo's story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud." Gofundme, which hosts the appeal, said it was the largest UK campaign it had seen, and the third largest globally. The fundraising milestone came after MPs gathered in the House of Commons on Monday to pay tribute to Mrs Cox as members of her family looked on. Friends of Mrs Cox have announced plans for a public event in Trafalgar Square in London on Wednesday, on what would have been her 42nd birthday. Mr Dixon said her husband Brendan was doing "an amazing job, and we're telling him that". He said: "Over the weekend, he was thinking about how having kids just three and five years old, they're not going to have many memories of their mother when they grow up - he wants to capture those memories now. "He had them write down special memories of mummy on pieces of paper, cut them out and hang them on the tree in his parents' garden." The Batley and Spen MP died after she was attacked outside a library on her way to a constituency surgery. Bernard Kenny, 77, was discharged from hospital on Monday night after he was stabbed in the stomach as he went to the aid of Mrs Cox. A petition to the Cabinet Office calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross has gained over 27,000 backers. Rachel Collinson, who started the petition and is a Green Party spokesperson, said the move would "draw the nation together to celebrate rather than to give in to fear". She said: "This man is a ray of light in a dark time, in a moment where the UK seems to be troubled by fear and division. This guy can be a beacon for all of us in what he did." A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "The government is of course aware of the calls for Bernard Kenny to receive an honour and we will examine the evidence, which will then be considered by the honours committee to decide whether to recommend him for an honour." Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.	The husband of killed MP Jo Cox has praised the public's "incredible generosity" after a fund set up in her memory hit £1m in donations.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon "My thoughts are with everyone involved in this tragic incident, and especially with the friends and families of the six people who lost their lives in what is another sad day for Glasgow and Scotland." Prime Minister David Cameron "I'm being kept fully briefed on the major incident in Glasgow. My thoughts are with the families of those involved and the emergency services." Labour leader Ed Miliband "Terrible news from Glasgow - my thoughts are with all those affected by this horrific accident." Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael "I share Scotland's deep shock at the horrible events in Glasgow this afternoon. On the eve of the festive period, these are unimaginable scenes in one of the busiest parts of our largest city." Church of Scotland Moderator John Chalmers "The news from the city centre of Glasgow just a few days before Christmas is simply devastating. For the second year in a row Glaswegians will have to dig deep into their reserves of compassion and sympathy as they support the families of those who have been killed and injured today." Glasgow Archbishop Philip Tartaglia "The circumstances could hardly be more tragic. I would ask any person of faith to pray for those who have died and their relatives and those who have been injured." Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson "This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected, particularly the families of those who have lost their lives." Glasgow Lord Provost Sadie Docherty "This is shocking and upsetting. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those affected by this terrible incident." Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy "People in Glasgow and across the whole of Scotland will be mourning this loss of life so close to Christmas. No words will be able to do justice to the pain the families involved will be feeling this evening." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson "This is a terrible tragedy, right in the heart of Scotland's biggest city. No-one expects that ordinary people, out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping, would fail to make it home.	Politicians, religious and civic leaders give their reaction to the bin lorry crash that killed six people in central Glasgow.
Moussa Dembele missed training on Tuesday with a hamstring complaint and will be assessed. Leigh Griffiths is serving a one-game ban for "provoking supporters" in the previous round against Linfield. Erik Sviatchenko is carrying a knock, while fellow central defender Dedryck Boyata is a long-term absentee. Norway winger Pal Andre Helland is Rosenborg's only injury absentee. Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said Sviatchenko "could well miss this game" and suggested that 19-year-old Kristoffer Ajer, who spent last season on loan to Kilmarnock, "could potentially" come into contention. Revealing that Dembele could also be a doubtful starter, he said: "We are looking at a possible injury he may have. "We could be without him and Leigh, so we need to find a way. "We do what we always do - we will try to find a solution within the team to make it work." Even if Celtic have to face Rosenborg without their two leading forwards, history is in their favour. The Glasgow club have played 25 Champions League qualifying matches at home and lost only four, winning 19 of them. Celtic have met Rosenborg twice before in European competition, winning three of the four legs against the Norwegians. Rosenborg progressed to the third round of qualifying thanks to an extra-time win over Dundalk. The team from Trondheim are top of the Norwegian Eliteserien, 17 games into the campaign, having won the last two championships following five years without winning the trophy. It is 10 years, though, since they last featured in the group stage of the Champions League. "We expect a tough game," added Rodgers. "They are well into their season, so they will be at a good level of fitness. "Rosenborg are very set on how they play. They like to build from behind in a 4-3-3. "They have good players but are very much based around the strength of the team." Matthias Vilhjalmsson is pushing for a starting place after scoring the extra-time winner in their 3-2 aggregate win over Dundalk. However, Rosenborg coach Kare Ingebrigtsen preferred former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner up front for both legs, which meant the Iceland international was in midfield for the first leg in Ireland and on the bench for the return. Rosenborg captain Mike Jensen is expecting an early onslaught at Celtic Park by a side he rates as favourites to progress to the play-off stage. "It's a big challenge for us," said Bendtner's fellow Dane. "They are maybe the best team we have played for a long time, but we need to focus on ourselves. "Everyone will agree that they are the favourites to go through, but the best version of Rosenborg will beat the second best version of Celtic. "We will have chances and I hope we have the courage to take them. We will have a go. It's not in our style to defend deep for 90 minutes. "They will come out with a lot of energy and we need to handle that early pressure."	Celtic may be without their two main strikers for the Champions League qualifier against Rosenborg in Glasgow on Wednesday.
Air accident investigators have been briefing families ahead of official publication of their final report. The police helicopter crashed onto the busy Clutha bar on 29 November 2013. An earlier interim report said the engines had shut down even though there was fuel in the reserve tank. Some relatives said the briefing had left many questions unanswered, and underlined the need for black box flight recorders to be fitted in all passenger-carrying aircraft. Following the meeting with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) in Glasgow on Wednesday evening, Ian O'Prey whose son Mark died in the bar, said there was "no resolution" to the tragedy. Mr O'Prey said there had been a few "heated moments" during the meeting but it "all calmed down". He said: "I don't think I'm any further forward. The AAIB - they think it was switches that were left on - or weren't left on. "My main question to them was flight recorders -  if they had flight recorders, it would have taken us a fraction of the time it has taken us. "Personally I feel calmer than I did before I went in. I can't keep shouting at the moon for the rest of my life although I feel I want to." Investigators are due to hold another closed meeting with bereaved relatives on Thursday and have asked families not to discuss the detailed findings until the report's official publication on Friday. John McGarrigle, whose father John died, said he felt "let down" despite optimism ahead of AAIB meeting. Mr McGarrigle said: "All tonight has done for me is raise loads more questions. My head is scrambled, I'm that angry. "Flight data recorders should be installed in every passenger-carrying aircraft - simple as. If we had that, we would know a lot more. "We wouldn't know the full cause, but we would know half of the reasons at least and we would have learned from it." Jim Morris, an aviation law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, also said the lack of a "black box" had hampered the investigation. He said: "Unfortunately, in my view, due to a lack of a requirement to fit a black box flight data recorder, we have almost more unanswered questions." Mr Morris added: "We still do not know why fuel did not reach the engines. "The report goes into significant detail in its analysis but it is clear from what is said in the report that they can't answer all the questions." Anne-Marie Kennedy, who was working behind the bar and was trapped in the wreckage, said she was "satisfied" with how the briefing went. She said: "It's shown me that they should have black boxes for defo, it's shown me the need for other regulation, but other than that nothing. "Until I speak to my legal team I can only speculate. "I'm satisfied with the way the night went. I believe that the AAIB has done everything in their power. "The guy explained the investigation, the complexity and the length of time. They did all they could." Find out more The Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night. The helicopter crew who were killed were pilot David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis. The seven customers in the Clutha who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued an interim report last year which said that both engines on the helicopter "flamed out" due to a fuel supply problem. The report, however, did not set out the cause.	Relatives of the 10 people who died in the Clutha helicopter tragedy in Glasgow have been told fuel switches were in the off position when they should have been on.
The X-47B jet is being designed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the US Navy. It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 5,000 feet. Officials say it will help form part of a new generation of unmanned drones and works like a smaller version of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. As such it would be very different from the current fleet of remote controlled military planes like the Predator and Reaper. Instead the X-47B would be virtually invisible to radar and fly at much faster speeds than those older, propeller driven machines. In a statement Captain Jaime Engdahl, a programme manager for the warplane, said: "Today we got a glimpse towards the future as the Navy's first-ever tailless, jet-powered unmanned aircraft took to the skies." The flight was primarily designed to test the jet's guidance and navigation systems and the aerodynamic control of the tailless design.

David Mackintosh was the leader of Northampton Borough Council when the authority authorised the loan to Northampton Town in 2013. The money has never been paid and the council is in the process of trying to get it back. Mr Mackintosh said "due diligence was carried out" before the loan was granted. The Conservative MP for Northampton South said he felt "angry, frustrated and upset" about the ongoing financial problems at the Cobblers. The club currently faces a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) over £166,000. This is due to be heard on 16 November. The £10.25m loan was originally given to the club for the re-development of its Sixfields stadium. Mr Mackintosh said all decisions over the loan were taken at the borough council's cabinet and followed "a lot of work" by officers. He said safeguards were put in place and were now being deployed by the council to recover the money. Mr Mackintosh said: "Clearly as leader I have to take some responsibility for what happened. "It is very frustrating because at the same time there are other things that haven't happened at the club. "There are serious questions to be answered." Club chairman David Cardoza previously told the BBC he expected the loan issue to be resolved by the end of last month.	An MP says he "has to take some responsibility" over an unpaid £10.25m loan to a football club.
The killings are thought to have taken place last year on a ranch in the western state of Michoacan last year. President Enrique Pena Nieto said he had dismissed Mr Galindo to allow for a transparent investigation. Earlier this month Mexico's National Human Rights Commission accused police of tampering with evidence. Michoacan: Mexico's failed state? One police officer and 42 suspects were killed in the raid on a ranch in Tanhuato in May last year. Officers said they had returned fire in self-defence but the high death toll aroused suspicions. The human rights commission report accused police of planting guns on some suspects and moving bodies to bolster the official version that all the deaths occurred during a gun battle. Mr Galindo and National Security Commissioner Renato Sales have denied anyone was summarily killed and insisted officers used necessary force against highly armed criminals. Police used a Black Hawk helicopter during the operation, reportedly firing some 4,000 rounds into the ranch, known as the Rancho del Sol, during the initial assault. The helicopter itself was hit by gunfire, investigators found. In its report (in Spanish; warning: contains graphic images), the CNDH asserts that: Michoacan has become one of Mexico's most violent states because of the rivalry between cartels.	Mexico's federal police chief, Enrique Galindo, has been sacked following allegations police killed at least 22 suspected members of a drugs cartel.

England's Isobel Pooley came second in the women's high jump, and Scotland's Lynsey Sharp won silver in the 800m, with England's Jessica Judd fourth. But there were more medals for English athletes as Tiffany Porter came second in the women's 100m hurdles and Jade Lally won a bronze in the discus. Media playback is not supported on this device Elsewhere, Kenya dominated the men's 3,000m steeplechase with gold, silver and bronze, and Uganda's Moses Kipsiro won the 10,000m. Lewis, 28, has now won a medal of each colour from the Commonwealth Games after coming third in Melbourne in 2006 and second four years ago in Delhi. Both he and Cutts cleared 5.55m, but failed three times at 5.60m to set up a jump-off. They were again unsuccessful at the same height, before the bar was lowered back down to 5.55m. After Cutts' failure, Lewis then cleared the bar to win the event. Australia's Eleanor Patterson cleared 1.94m to win the women's high jump, while Pooley's career-best effort of 1.92m was enough to see her finish ahead of Levern Spencer of St Lucia. But a packed crowd at Hampden Park got the medal they wanted as Sharp, who had been on a hospital drip in the early hours of Friday, won silver in the 800m. She finished behind Eunice Jepkoech of Kenya, with Uganda's Winnie Nanyondo third. Media playback is not supported on this device Australia's defending Commonwealth Games champion Sally Pearson retained her 100m hurdles crown, with Canada's Angela Whyte joining her and Porter on the podium. In the women's discus, Lally's throw of 60.48m won her a bronze as Dani Samuels of Australia claimed gold and India's Seema Punia silver. Jonathan Ndiku took the men's 3,000m steeplechase title and finished in front of fellow Kenyans Jairus Birech and Ezekiel Kemboi. There was also an African winner in a thrilling 10,000m with Moses Kipsiro of Uganda first, Josphat Kipkoech Bett of Kenya second and Cameron Levins of Canada third. Elsewhere, in the heats of the men's 1500m, Charlie Grice (England), Chris Gowell (Wales) and Chris O'Hare (Scotland) all qualified for Saturday's final. Also on the track, England qualified for both the men's and women's 4x400m relay finals, and will be joined by Scotland in the men's race. Only Lee Doran of Wales from the home nations qualified for the javelin final, but English trio Phillips Idowu, Nathan Fox and Nathan Douglas are still involved in the triple jump competition.	England's Steve Lewis won gold and Luke Cutts took silver in the men's pole vault at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured. This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a £27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at £36m from Monaco. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.

The government announced in 2014 that it wanted to build a tunnel alongside the World Heritage site. But Highways England is also considering a route which would take the A303 south of the city. A £2bn 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel is the government's preferred option at Stonehenge but some archaeologists argue it could damage the ancient site. In an email, seen by the BBC, Highways England suggests a southern bypass route would be "considered" as part of the "design consultation" phase of the upgrade. Last week, Atkins/Arup was awarded a £17.5m design contract for the scheme. The group will be "developing options" to upgrade the road - including that of a tunnel - with the aim of construction work starting in 2020. £1.4bn Proposed cost of Stonehenge tunnel 1.8 miles is the length of the proposed tunnel (2.9km) 9.6 sq m around Stonehenge is a World Heritage site (25 sq km) 33% of the route is single carriageway 84 years since the A-road opened There are growing concerns over congestion on the A303 which has been described as "highly detrimental" by English Heritage, which manages the monument. However, a group of historians - called the Stonehenge Alliance - has called for "no further damage" to the world heritage site. Historian Tom Holland, from the group, said the southern option was "better than ploughing through the richest archaeological site in Europe" and called for "lateral thinking" over A303 congestion. And Icomos, which advises UN cultural body Unesco, said it was "concerned" any upgrade could have a "highly adverse impact" on the World Heritage landscape around the stones. Both English Heritage and the National Trust have given their support to the option of "the longest tunnel possible". In a statement, Highways England said: "As part of our public engagement we are committed to considering the alternative routes that are being suggested and will look at these as part of our engagement work. "The improvements are currently at an early stage of development. As we develop our proposals in compliance with the statutory processes, we will consult a variety of stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, road users and interested parties. "We are aiming to start a wider and public consultation in early 2017." A similar tunnel scheme for the route, which links London and the South West, was dropped in 2007 because of the spiralling cost. The government said the cost of a bored 1.3m (2.1km) tunnel could not be justified at £540m - double the initial estimate of £223m.	A southern bypass of Salisbury is being considered as an alternative to a Stonehenge tunnel, the BBC has learned.
He told Fox News the Democrats were putting out the reports because they were embarrassed at the scale of the election defeat. On Friday, CIA officials told US media they had concluded that Russians hackers were trying to help Mr Trump. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the hacking accusations. Mr Trump said it might have been Russia but it was impossible to know. "They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody sitting in a bed some place," he said. President Barack Obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the Democratic Party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign. Senior Republicans have now joined Democrats in calling for a full investigation. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a joint statement on Sunday with top Democrats that the CIA's report "should alarm every American". He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the White House. In October, US government officials pointed the finger at Russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process. But on Friday, the intelligence community went further when US media reports said the CIA had "high confidence" that Russians were trying to influence the election in Mr Trump's favour. Russians had hacked the Republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said. But Mr Trump told Fox News Sunday: "I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it." He said the Democrats were behind the news reports, not the CIA, because they suffered such a big defeat. While backing the Obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on Russia but on other countries or individuals too. Republican party spokesman Sean Spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong. Mr Trump also said in the interview he did not need daily intelligence briefings. "I'm a smart person, I don't need to be told the same thing in the same way for eight years." Elsewhere in the interview, he said: Mr Trump, an outsider who stunned the political world by beating Hillary Clinton in last month's election, will assume office on 20 January. Why Trump strikes a chord with Russians Russia's Putin calls Trump 'a clever man' Are there any Trump links to Putin?	President-elect Donald Trump has rejected as "ridiculous" a CIA assessment that Russian hackers tried to sway the election in his favour.
London turned down the chance to host the Grand Depart, citing the cost of staging the event - reported to be about £35m - as the reason. It will be the first time since West Berlin in 1987 that Germany has hosted the opening stage of road cycling's premier race. La Manche in north-west France will host the 2016 Grand Depart. This 2015 event started in the Dutch city of Utrecht, a year after thousands came to Leeds to watch the cyclists set off.	The 2017 Tour de France will begin in the German city of Dusseldorf, it has been announced.
Kevin Hyland told the BBC it was "deeply concerning" that hundreds of Nigerians were brought in every year for prostitution or forced labour. Mr Hyland said the problem of such exploitation was "enormous". The Home Office said it was "committed to tackling modern slavery" and was addressing specific issues in Nigeria. The commissioner, who has only been in post for six months, says he can't think of anything more worrying than women and children being raped and forced into domestic servitude. Latest figures from the National Crime Agency show that more than 2,000 potential trafficking victims were referred to the authorities in 2014 - 244 of whom were from Nigeria, a 31 per cent increase from the previous year. The highest number of potential victims were identified as being from Albania. Campaigners believe the real figure of potential trafficking victims from Nigeria could be much higher, however. Mr Hyland, the former head of the Metropolitan Police's human trafficking unit, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I am extremely concerned about this. And we're talking about several hundred every year. "This isn't just a one-off - it's continuous - so the treatment of these people, what they go through, is actually a very serious crime, so for me it's a big problem. "But also I think the fact that there is a demand for this kind of exploitation in the United Kingdom really concerns me, that there are people who will want to buy sex, will want to exploit, will want to have children as what are current-day slaves, so that is a really serious problem." Research published by the Home Office in December estimates that there are between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of slavery in the UK.  Home Secretary Theresa May, speaking last year, described the scale of abuse as "shocking". Melissa (not her real name), who is in her 20s, was trafficked to the UK to work for a Nigerian woman in London as a domestic slave. From the age of 10, she was made to clean the kitchen, sell food on a market, feed and bathe other children, and go to school and do her homework.  She was beaten regularly, and locked in her room if she answered back. She said: "I know that this sounds unbelievable and the reason it sounds unbelievable is because, you know, who does that to someone? "I don't understand the hatred because that's how I feel - hated. I felt I didn't do anything to deserve that and at some point I actually thought I was the one that was the problem, that there's something about me that's making her do that to me." Trafficking for the purpose of domestic service and other forms of exploitative labour is a widespread phenomenon in Nigeria. Children and women are recruited to serve middle-class families in Nigeria or abroad. Domestic servants are sometimes poorer relatives, whose families think they will get a better life in a wealthier household. And this can happen, alongside the cases of abuse. Others servants are procured from rural areas, where there are few economic opportunities. Women are also trafficked for prostitution, with a promise of a well-paid job but they end up realising too late that they have been lured into a debt bond by criminal gangs. This is a particular problem in the southern Edo state, where there is a long tradition of trafficking women to work as prostitutes in Italy. Debbie Ariyo, executive director of the charity Africans Unite Against Child Abuse, is adamant that the real number of those trafficked to the UK from Nigeria is much higher because many victims are reluctant to speak out. She deals with hundreds of victims and believes the reasons for these people coming to the UK in the first place are the same. She said: "There is a notion among the families in Nigeria that once their family has come over here, they will have a better life, they will get better education, they will have better food and material things. "A lot of people don't see the abuse and exploitation and many of the young people who've tried to tell their parents back home, it's difficult for the parents to accept that something like this could be happening in Britain." The anti-slavery commissioner is calling for further prosecutions and for more victims to be identified, saying that a "handful of convictions is not enough". Mr Hyland said: "It's about working with the law enforcement agencies in Nigeria - working with all those in the communities and telling them this could happen - and that's never been brought together before so it's unique. "This is a new idea - Europol, Interpol, National Crime Agency, all must work together. It's up to me to oversee this. "This is not about lack of resources but about using them effectively." Tatiana Jardan, director of the Human Trafficking Foundation charity, believes that combating this problem is easier said than done because it's a complex issue. She said: "We believe the role of the commissioner is crucial but solving this is not going to be easy. "This is a difficult type of trafficking because Nigerians believe in witchcraft so they're worried about speaking out in case some harm comes to them. The police and other authorities desperately need more education so that they understand these complexities." A Home Office spokesman said: "This government is committed to tackling modern slavery, including human trafficking, which is why the Modern Slavery Act 2015 was passed earlier this year. "This legislation, the first of its kind in Europe, gives law enforcement the tools they need to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and enhances protection for victims. "The Modern Slavery Strategy, which was published in November last year, sets out an ambitious plan, including work with international partners, to increase collaboration and target human traffickers. "We are already addressing the specific issue of human trafficking in Nigeria. This includes working closely with the National Crime Agency and the Nigerian National Agency for the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons to identify and disrupt Nigerian networks involved in the movement of potential victims." With the commissioner only having been in post for six months, campaigners say it would be unfair to make an assessment now. Some argue the creation of his role in the first place is a sign the issue is being taken seriously.	Clamping down on the problem of Nigerians being trafficked to the UK is a main priority, the first independent anti-slavery commissioner says.
Rachid Lamrabet, 42, who lives in London, denies sexually assaulting a 25-year-old man at Greyfriars Kirk, on 26 August 2015. The judge said the case was being deserted after a matter arose and he heard legal submissions. He added that there were "good reasons" for the move. The trial had only just begun at the High Court in Livingston on Monday. Dismissing the jury members, judge Lord Woolman told them: "In the light of submissions made to me I regret that I'm going to discharge you as a jury and continue this case until tomorrow. "I'm not in a position to tell you the exact reasons for that all I can tell you is that there are very good reasons. "I very much regret that this has happened, but sometimes matters occur which are outwith our control. "I regret and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused to you." Mr Lamrabet, is accused of engaging in consensual sexual activity with his alleged victim but ignored him when he was told to stop. The charge states that he seized the younger man by the body, pushed him to the ground and raped him to his injury. English is not the accused's native language, and a Spanish interpreter sat with him in the dock so he could understand the proceedings.	The case of a man accused of a homosexual rape in an Edinburgh graveyard has been deserted and will restart with a fresh jury.
The East Riding of Yorkshire Council refused planning permission for the scheme at North Ferriby, near Hull, in May 2013. The developer St Modwen appealed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Greg Clark, who has rejected the plan. The company said it was disappointed and is considering its options. The Melton Fields project would have consisted of 510 houses and a care home. The company also applied for permission for an alternative smaller scheme of 390 homes. Villagers mounted a campaign against the development, with more than 1,200 people writing letters objecting to the plans. East Riding council rejected both proposals claiming the land had been earmarked for employment rather than residential use. The developer appealed against the council's decision to the government's Planning Inspectorate, which held a public inquiry last year. Councillor John Mabbett, vice chairman of North Ferriby Parish Council, described the secretary of state's refusal as "a victory for common sense". "Had this ill-conceived development been approved our community would have been overwhelmed by its size and the fabric and character of the village would have been harmed for ever," he said. A spokesperson for St Modwen said: "We firmly believe that our proposals for a residential development represent the most viable option for the site, and for the region. "Our proposals would not only deliver much needed family homes, but also bring important investment and jobs to the local area."	The government has turned down plans to build more than 500 homes near an East Yorkshire village.
But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. "The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology," she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet "addicts". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in "the current century and not the last". The benefits are "difficult to put into league tables", he says. But they create a "sense of empowerment" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel "trusted and valued". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. "I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is," said Mr Mason.	Almost 70% of primary and secondary schools in the UK now use tablet computers, according to research.
The blackout lasted just over an hour and started just before midnight on 17 December. The cyber-security company Information Systems Security Partners (ISSP) has linked the incident to a hack and blackout in 2015 that affected 225,000. It also said a series of other recent attacks in Ukraine were connected. The 2016 power cut had amounted to a loss of about one-fifth of Kiev's power consumption at that time of night, national energy company Ukrenergo said at the time. It affected the Pivnichna substation outside the capital, and left people in part of the city and a surrounding area without electricity until shortly after 01:00. The attack took place almost exactly one year after a much larger hack on a regional electricity distribution company. That was later blamed on the Russian security services. The latest attack has not publicly been attributed to any state actor, but Ukraine has said Russia directed thousands of cyber attacks towards it in the final months of 2016. ISSP, a Ukrainian company investigating the incidents on behalf of Ukrenergo, now appears to be suggesting a firmer link. It said that both the 2015 and 2016 attacks were connected, along with a series of hacks on other state institutions this December, including the national railway system, several government ministries and a national pension fund. Oleksii Yasnskiy, head of ISSP labs, said: "The attacks in 2016 and 2015 were not much different - the only distinction was that the attacks of 2016 became more complex and were much better organised." He also said different criminal groups had worked together, and seemed to be testing techniques that could be used elsewhere in the world for sabotage. However, David Emm, principal security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said it was was "hard to say for sure" if the incident was a trial run. "It's possible, but given that critical infrastructure facilities vary so widely - and therefore require different approaches to compromise the systems - the re-use of malware across systems is likely to be limited," he told the BBC. "On the other hand, if a system has proved to be porous in the past, it is likely to encourage further attempts." In December, Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said hackers had targeted state institutions some 6,500 times in the last two months of 2016. He said the incidents showed Russia was waging a cyber-war against the country. "Acts of terrorism and sabotage on critical infrastructure facilities remain possible today," Mr Poroshenko said during a meeting of the National Security and Defence Council, according to a statement released by his office. "The investigation of a number of incidents indicated the complicity directly or indirectly of Russian security services."	A power cut that hit part of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in December has been judged a cyber-attack by researchers investigating the incident.
Eight houses on the A3055 Undercliff Drive on the Isle of Wight were evacuated in 2014. One family complained to the Local Government Ombudsman over the council's response to the evacuation and subsequent work on the road. The council agreed to pay Â£5,000 compensation to the family. Emergency services helped residents leave their homes on Undercliff Drive - between Niton and St Lawrence - following the landslip after heavy rain in February 2014. The road was closed with properties only accessible on foot.  In 2016, a temporary route to provide full access for local residents was created. Council statements in the years following the landslip insisted householders were "an absolute priority" and said they would be "fully informed of progress" on road works. The ombudsman's report said: "I also have seen no persuasive evidence to show it properly planned and adequately managed the situation." It also said its road plans were "disjointed and reactive" and it did not give "timely and clear responses" to householders. Delays in carrying out work were blamed on a "lack of effective liaison and project planning". The ombudsman said the unnamed family, some of whom had long-term medical conditions, suffered "avoidable distress" due to the council's actions. The council was also ordered to help pay the family's costs in returning their house to a habitable condition. A spokeswoman said: "The council has worked with the family to ensure that the recommendations of the report are being met. "The family is now living in their home and work to meet the recommendations remain ongoing, in close consultation with the family, as required."	A council's response to a collapsed road following a landslip was "disjointed", a local government watchdog has found.
Nicole Clark used her mother Avril Stewart's bank details to set up online accounts. The 30-year-old, from Woodside, admitted stealing the money between 8 August and 26 August last year. Depute fiscal Robbie Brown told Perth Sheriff Court that the accused's mother had not recouped any of the stolen money. Sheriff William Wood deferred sentence for the preparation of social work reports.	A Perthshire woman lost £2,020 she had stolen from her mother gambling at an online casino, a court was told.
The young girl was injured by the drug patrol dog in Belmarsh Prison, Woolwich, on 31 March. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the incident had been reported to police and the dog withdrawn from service. In 2015, the MoJ said there were more than 530 dogs deployed in prisons in England and Wales. The Mirror reported the attack had taken place during a routine drugs test and the girl needed to undergo plastic surgery because of her injuries. The MoJ said it could not release more details because of "purdah" rules in the run up to the general election.	A toddler was bitten by a sniffer dog while she was visiting a relative in a high security jail in east London, it has emerged.
The Ghanaian midfielder signed a one-year deal after impressing on trial. Buaben left Carlisle in May and joins ex-Dundee United team-mate Morgaro Gomis and fellow new signings James Keatings, Soufian El Hassnaoui, Neil Alexander and Alim Ozturk. "It's great that Prince has put pen to paper," head coach Robbie Neilson told the official Hearts website. "He's been at training for the last two weeks and he's played a few games for us. "He's looking good and he's a top player. He's played in the SPL for a long time and he's played in England at a very high level so I'm pleased to get him. "He gives us a bit of strength in there. We've got some good options now in the middle of the field. He's a good character as well. "He hadn't done a pre-season after he finished up last season so I just wanted to see where he was and he's a fit guy. "If this is the condition he's in, having only trained for just over a week, then I'm looking forward to seeing what we can get out of him in two or three weeks time." Buaben moved to Dundee United in 2007 and was part of the side that won the Scottish Cup in 2010. He also had a short spell on loan last season at Partick Thistle.	Prince Buaben has become Hearts' sixth summer signing after agreeing terms with the Tynecastle club.
Michael Luciw, 27, from Nottingham, was a passenger in a van that was hit by a Mazda Premacy, being driven the wrong way on the motorway by Albert Kenneth Newman, who also died. Mr Luciw's family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests. Age UK said it was "vital" older people could drive for as long as possible. The family described Mr Luciw, the father of a baby girl, as generous, kind-hearted and a lover of practical jokes. "He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him," said his mum Andrea Shelton. "He was looking forward to his baby's first crawl. Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own." "It doesn't feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us," said Mr Luciw's brother Simon. "There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided. People are driving that shouldn't be on the road. "The older you get, the more your reactions slow down. "There needs to be some sort of test introduced, in a car with a driving instructor, so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are. "You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can't say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed." Mrs Shelton said Mr Luciw, a delivery driver, was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02:00 GMT on 12 October near Kegworth, Leicestershire. Mr Newman's car was heading north on the southbound carriageway. Mr Harrington, who was driving the Ford Transit, said he had not seen Mr Newman's car until the last second. "I managed to swerve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do," he said. "You couldn't even blink that fast. "It lives with me. I still get sleepless nights. It's not something I will ever forget." Mr Harrington, who sustained serious injuries in the crash, said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations. "It's up to the government whether they listen to us," he said. "But if that driver hadn't been on the road that morning, Michael would still be here with his daughter." Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-assessment form every three years to renew their licences. The form does not include a medical or driving test. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age. "Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others," it said. "The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving. "If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical standard we immediately remove their entitlement to drive." Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: "We know driving often allows older people to have the independence to get out and about, go shopping and attend appointments so it's vital that older people are supported to continue driving safely for as long as possible." For more on this subject watch Inside Out on BBC One East Midlands at 19:30 GMT on Monday 25 January and nationwide for 30 days thereafter on the iPlayer.	The family of a man killed in a crash with an 87-year-old who was travelling the wrong way on the M1 have called for older drivers to be retested.
Bielsa, 60, a former Argentina and Chile boss, resigned from French club Marseille in August and is unattached. He led Spanish club Athletic Bilbao to the 2012 Europa League and Copa del Rey finals before a 2014 move to Marseille. Swansea parted company with Garry Monk on Wednesday and are thought to want a new boss before Sunday's West Ham game. Monk left the club following a run of just one win in 11 Premier League games. AEK Athens boss Gus Poyet was thought to be in the frame to replace him, but the Greek club said that they had not received an approach from Swansea regarding Poyet. Sevilla manager Unai Emery has also been linked with the job. Swansea's first-team coach Alan Curtis was in caretaker charge of Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Manchester City.	Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins is in South America as he steps up the search for a new manager, with Argentina's Marcelo Bielsa the odds-on favourite.
Media playback is not supported on this device The news of Annan Athletic's 4-1 fourth-round win over Hamilton Academical was far-reaching. Omar, the son of refugees from Iraqi Kurdistan, was featured in the local press there. "There's a big following there now, my uncle tells me," said the Glasgow University student. "A lot of them, when they are looking out for scores, will look out for Annan Athletic now." Annan's dream ended in the fifth round though, when they lost 4-1 to Morton.

Radioactive cooling water was also mistakenly discharged into a submarine reactor compartment, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) reported. Reporting of safety incidents at the base, which refits Britain's nuclear submarines, was "below standard". Contractor Babcock International said safety was its "highest priority". The ONR issued a legal notice to improve after an incident last year in which a worker was contaminated with radiation. The ONR said the dose was "very small" but it "highlighted shortfalls" in health and safety at the yard. Babcock has been ordered "to bring the arrangements up to an acceptable standard" before the end of January 2016. The ONR said five other incidents broke safety rules between October and December last year. They were: The ONR also reported "shortfalls in the operation of the emergency monitoring vehicles" during a nuclear submarine accident exercise. Peter Burt, researcher at the anti-nuclear weapons pressure group Nuclear Information Service, said: "This is a worrying string of events in a short time at Devonport. "If the site operators are not able to improve performance rapidly the MoD should take steps to take the operating contract away from Babcock." Nuclear engineering consultant John Large, who has advised the government and environmental groups on nuclear issues, said: "These are not uncommon incidents in a complex operation like Devonport. "But the level of detail is not good enough. For instance what is the connection with the torpedo tubes and a radiological incident on the submarine?" The ONR declined to go into any more detail on the incidents, saying the reports were intended as summaries. Babcock said in a statement: "Improvements relating to the ONR enforcement notice and other recently reported incidents at Devonport Royal Dockyard are being addressed through a broader nuclear safety improvement programme to further enhance our current high levels of safety, in agreement with ONR." Plymouth City Council said it "takes the safety of nuclear operations at Devonport extremely seriously, as does the site operator. "It is protocol that we are informed immediately of any safety issues or incidents that are likely to be of concern to the wider public. "The operator also reports on its safety performance every six months at the local liaison committee." The Ministry of Defence (MoD) declined to comment.	Devonport naval base has been warned of legal action after a worker received a dose of radiation amid a series of safety breaches.
The 6ft 4in player, who finished top scorer in last season's Europa League, has signed a four-year contract. Kozak, 24, has represented his country four times and becomes Villa's seventh signing of the summer. "He'll add greatly to what we've got," said Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert. "He has an unbelievable scoring record in the Europa League." Kozak scored eight times in European football's second-tier knockout competition last season. Lambert says his arrival will ease the pressure on fellow striker Christian Benteke, who has scored 22 times in 37 Premier League appearances since arriving from Belgian side Genk a year ago. "We need somebody like him as we only have Christian Benteke really as a main target man," added Lambert. Midfielder Stephen Ireland, 27, has joined Stoke City on loan for the rest of the season while Barry Bannan has signed for Crystal Palace on a three-year deal. Villa manager Paul Lambert has already added to his attacking options this summer, with the signing of striker Nicklas Helenius from Aalborg.	Aston Villa have signed Czech Republic striker Libor Kozak from Lazio in a deal worth about £7m.
Howe, 37, has overseen three of the club's six promotions since he was first appointed manager in 2008-09. The new deal is believed to take Howe through until 2020. He had two-and-a-half years left on his previous contract with the Cherries. "We've been in discussions since gaining promotion. I'm very pleased to have committed my future to here," he told the club's website. Following a short spell as manager of Burnley, Howe returned to manage the club at the end of 2012, leading them to promotions from League One and the Championship within three seasons. "I'm delighted Eddie has committed his future to the club," owner Maxim Demin said.	Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has signed an extension to his contract.
Jayden Stockley headed wide from Jonny Hayes' cross early in the second half and Rangers quickly capitalised on that miss when Kenny Miller tucked in. A powerful Lee Hodson shot doubled the home side's advantage. The hosts' Clint Hill and Aberdeen's Ryan Jack were each dismissed for two bookings, with Andrew Considine heading a late consolation for the Dons. The Ibrox side had started the day level on points with Hearts but trailing them on goal difference. However, with Hearts held to a draw by Ross County, Mark Warburton's side go two points ahead of the Tynecastle side and remain eight behind leaders Celtic. Rangers had lost at Hearts in midweek while Aberdeen were coming off a 3-0 defeat by Celtic in Sunday's League Cup final, with the Dons aiming to end a 25-year wait for a win at Ibrox. But that run continues with Warburton's side winning by the same scoreline that they lost by at Aberdeen's Pittodrie in September. The visitors had their chances in Glasgow with James Maddison - who scored a stunning free-kick winner in the sides' last meeting - seeing a set-piece effort bounce wide. Stockley got a foot to a Graeme Shinnie cross to draw a save from Wes Foderingham and came close to putting Derek McInnes' side ahead three minutes after the break. Hayes got round his man to cross from the left but Stockley could not direct his header from six yards on target. Maddison failed to get a hold of a couple of shots before Rangers' second but the midfielder did deliver the free-kick for Considine's goal. Captain Lee Wallace fired wide in the hosts' best first-half advance and it was the composure of Miller that finally broke the deadlock. Moments after Stockley's miss, 36-year-old striker Miller, deployed in midfield, latched on to Joe Garner's speculative cross and finished first time. Barrie McKay had the vision to find Hodson inside the box amid a spell of pressure and the Northern Ireland international lashed a shot into the roof of the net for Rangers' second, having started ahead of regular right-back James Tavernier. McKay's replacement Harry Forrester forced a save from Joe Lewis as the pressure continued. Defender Hill had earlier escaped unpunished following a risky challenge on Shinnie inside his own box but bookings for fouls on Maddison resulted in the 38-year-old's dismissal. Jack, 24, followed Hill up the tunnel after being cautioned in the wake of a lengthy spell of pushing following a Rangers foul, the Dons skipper having earlier been booked for impeding Michael O'Halloran. And there were further bookings in stoppage time to take the tally to 11. Rangers' Mark Warburton: "The players were more than irked by comments made about them, by comments questioning their battling qualities and their desire. "But they responded really well, there was a lot of nonsense written about them and they more than answered those questions. "First half nobody really controlled the game, it was pretty neutral. But, second half, we stepped on and won second balls and I felt we deserved to win." Aberdeen's Derek McInnes: "From penalty box to penalty box I thought we were the better team. "We really got after Rangers, we pressed them high, we were competitive, we were winning tackles, we were fully committed. I thought we really frustrated them. "But we said to the players at half-time, it was important in the final third to carry more of a threat ourselves,. We got in good areas and rushed that last wee bit. "We had more opportunities to apply pressure with the ball rather than just without the ball, and Rangers scored when we were having our best spell. "We started the second half really on the front foot, got into good areas, still should be doing more with it, but Jayden's is clearly the one we all remember. "It was a good stand-up from Jonny and Jayden would normally eat that type of service up, but he misses. It happens but unfortunately for us it was pivotal." Match ends, Rangers 2, Aberdeen 1.

The star of TV series Dexter and Six Feet Under, Hall played the lead role in Bowie's musical Lazarus, which premiered shortly before his death. He will perform the title song, which opens with the line: "Look up here, I'm in heaven", and was widely interpreted as Bowie's personal epitaph. The song also appears on Bowie's Mercury-nominated Blackstar album. Other nominees include Laura Mvula, The 1975, Kano and Bat For Lashes. Radiohead are also shortlisted for their album A Moon Shaped Pool. It is their fifth nomination - but they have yet to win the Â£25,000 prize. The band, who are on a brief break from their world tour, are not expected to perform at the ceremony, but most of the other acts will appear. On the night, the 12 nominated albums will be cut down to six finalists, one of whom will be chosen by a public vote. A panel of judges, including Jarvis Cocker, Annie Mac and Wolf Alice frontwoman Ellie Rowsell, will then choose the overall winner.

Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995 while on guard at a perimeter fence at Deepcut. An original inquest into his death recorded a verdict of suicide. His family applied for a new hearing after using the Human Rights Act to access evidence held by police. His twin, Tony Benton, and sister, Tracy Lewis, wept and said: "We are just happy and relieved. It's been too long." A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: "We care deeply about our young recruits and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Sean Benton." BBC Local Live: For the latest updates and more news The malevolent culture at Deepcut barracks Justice Collins said fresh evidence had "come to light which casts some doubt upon the correctness" of the original decision. He added that under article two of the Human Rights Act there was material that questioned the care Pte Benton received from the Army at the time. Mrs Lewis said: "Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death." "For two decades, our family has been tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut," she added. "If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain. "It should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police that our mother had to fight for so long - far longer than she should have had to - to force the authorities to answer basic questions." The family said the original inquest took less than two hours and heard from six people. A criminal investigation seven years later found no evidence of third party involvement. Pte Benton's medical records were not obtained and no evidence was gathered or presented about his experiences at the base. The family, who are represented by human rights group Liberty, believe he was subjected to severe bullying. In a statement, the MoD said: "The Armed Forces will not tolerate abuse, bullying, or discrimination. All allegations are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken." "It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing -  we will assist the coroner as necessary," it added. Pte Benton was the first of four young soldiers to die at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, North Wales, shot herself in November 1995, according to a second inquest into her death which concluded in June. However, the coroner criticised a lack of training, structure and inappropriate sexual relationships in the camp. Pte James' father, Des, said he had applied to the MoD for a full public inquiry into what went on at the barracks. Pte Geoff Gray, 17, from Hackney, east London, was found dead with two gunshot wounds to his head on 17 September 2001. Pte James Collinson, 17, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound through his chin on 23 March 2002. A date for the fresh inquest into Pte Benton's death is yet to be set.	A fresh inquest can take place into the death of a young soldier at an army barracks in Surrey 21 years ago, a high court judge has ruled.
Flt Lt Andrew Townshend cost the Ministry of Defence millions of pounds when he deactivated the autopilot of the military passenger jet. The Voyager aircraft, which had 198 passengers and crew on board, plummeted 4,400ft (1,341m) over the Black Sea. Townshend pleaded guilty to negligently performing a duty and was also handed a four-month suspended prison sentence. The court martial heard that during a flight from RAF Brize Norton to Afghanistan on 9 February 2014 the 49-year-old pilot's camera was pushed into the aircraft's control stick as he moved his seat, switching off the autopilot. A board of RAF officers at Bulford, Wiltshire, heard crew and passengers thought they were going to die during the flight, and some were thrown weightless into the air and smashed into the ceiling. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said the incident led to the grounding of the military fleet of six Voyager aircraft for 13 days while the cause of the nosedive was investigated. This led to service personnel being stranded in Afghanistan while they waited for the aircraft to be brought back into service, he added. He said up to 48 personnel were left unfit for duty and the co-pilot, Flt Lt Nathan Jones, who suffered fractures to his spine, is still unable to resume flying duties. Mr Lickley said: "Their lives and health and welfare were put at significant risk by Flt Lt Townshend's negligence." The experienced pilot - who has served with the RAF for 30 years and completed 5,500 flying hours - had been using his camera to photograph other aircraft from the cockpit and had taken 95 shots that day. He also told the court that he had been viewing the star-filled sky moments before the incident, as he had a passion for star-gazing. Judge Advocate Alan Large told Townshend: "This was not a momentary lapse of concentration, your eye was well off the ball." On Wednesdy, Townshend was found not guilty of perjury and making a false record, after being accused of dishonestly claiming the dive was caused by a technical fault.	An RAF pilot who caused his plane to nosedive while using a digital camera has been dismissed by a military court.
An Adventure in Space and Time, written by Mark Gatiss, will tell the story of the formation of the sci-fi drama in the early 1960s. The actor, best-known for his role as caretaker Filch in the Harry Potter films, gave a "wonderfully touching and subtle performance" said Gatiss. The one-off drama will be shown as part of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary. Bradley said he was "absolutely thrilled" to be offered the role by Gatiss after starring in a 2012 episode, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. "When he asked if I would interested, I almost bit his hand off!" Bradley said earlier this year. Scottish actor Brian Cox, will appear alongside Bradley as BBC Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, who was credited with the creation of the show. Doctor Who was first broadcast on 23 November 1963, with a four-part adventure known as An Unearthly Child. Hartnell, who died in 1975, starred in the series from 1963 to 1966 before being replaced by Patrick Troughton. An Adventure in Space and Time is one of a number of programmes that will mark Doctor Who's half-centenary later this year.	A new picture of actor David Bradley as the first Doctor, William Hartnell, has been released by the BBC.
Sidwell, 34, has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years. With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign, the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal. "I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League," he said. Brighton's recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion, and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle, Chris Hughton's side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches. Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016. He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again. Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex: "When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected. "When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal. "If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer."	Steve Sidwell says he has done all he can to earn a new Brighton contract and play in the Premier League next season.
Synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in counties Cork, Meath, Wexford, Galway and Dublin, beginning at 09:45 local time in Cork. Thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin on Sunday for a parade to mark the centenary. The commemoration events have been organised by the Irish government. The rebellion is viewed as a seminal event in the founding of the state. The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland. More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting. A weekend of events to mark the centenary of the Rising began on Saturday with a remembrance ceremony in Dublin at which Irish president Michael D Higgins laid a wreath. Wreaths were also laid in Dublin at Kilmainham Gaol, where 14 of the Rising's leaders were executed, and at the Sigerson Monument in Glasnevin Cemetery, which is dedicated to to all those who lost their lives in the Rising. The synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies on Monday have been organised by the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking areas). The locations and times are: Then, at 12:30 local time, wreaths will be laid at various buildings and landmarks around the Irish capital that became focal points during the rebellion. They include Boland's Mill, Jacob's Factory, Dublin Castle/City Hall, The Four Courts, Royal College of Surgeons and Moore Street.	The centenary of the Easter Rising, the rebellion that began on Easter Monday 1916, is to be marked in Irish towns and cities with wreath-laying events.
One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
Russian state TV has been suggesting - somewhat gleefully - that such products could be banned in retaliation for the EU extending economic sanctions against Russia. The European restrictions were introduced last year after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine; Moscow hit back with counter-sanctions in August, targeting EU producers' profits. Even the agriculture minister called the idea of adding a European wine ban 'radical,' given that domestic production is nowhere near enough to meet demand, not to mention the quality. But he didn't exclude it. The bullish tone of the reporting is typical of the defiant mood in Russia after a year under Western sanctions. That same mood dominated the St Petersburg International Economic Forum late last week, dubbed the 'Russian Davos,' where a key message appeared to be: 'they didn't break us.' The glitzy event was boycotted in 2014 by senior US and European executives in protest at the Ukraine crisis. This year some returned to encounter a decidedly upbeat Vladimir Putin informing them that a 'catastrophe' had been averted. "We have stabilised the situation [â€¦] and are now making our way forward confidently through this difficult patch," Russia's President assured his audience. As well as asset freezes and individual travel bans, the sanctions limit access to Western financial markets for state firms. They also ban arms trade and the export of equipment used in specific oil projects. Calculating their precise impact is impossible as the restrictions were imposed at the same time as the price of Russia's chief export, oil, plummeted. But Russia's economy shrank 2% in the first quarter of 2015, the rouble has plunged, inflation has soared and the number of people living below the poverty line has risen. "I don't like it when there is some discrimination, that's not fair," Russia's trade minister, Denis Manturov, told the BBC, in response to the news that sanctions were being extended. But he insists it's the oil price that's hurt Russia's economy, not sanctions. "To be honest, for me - who is responsible for Russian industry - [sanctions are] a motivation. To motivate Russian companies to produce and supply not only for the local market, but abroad," the minister added. Import substitution has become the official mantra as Russia attempts to capitalise on gaps in the market created by Western sanctions and Russian counter-measures. So Mr. Manturov says domestic firms are now supplying energy firms with equipment they once imported, for example, and local dairy production has certainly expanded. But economists warn that the EU ban on credit can't be ignored. "Sanctions are clearly making the situation a lot worse," explains Moscow-based analyst Chris Weafer, of Macro Advisory. On paper the ban only applies to state-owned banks, but even non-sanctioned banks and companies are being denied financing by Western institutions wary of the risk. "It's like a voluntary expansion of the sanctions," Chris Weafer explains. With no new money entering the market, and no sign of China rushing to fill the funding-gap, Russian banks prioritise credit to major state-owned firms and the cost for everyone else has soared. Far from the insistent optimism of the economic forum, the General Motors plant stands almost idle on the industrial outskirts of St. Petersburg. The territory around is filled with unsold cars. US-based GM will shut its plant here for good at the end of June citing a 'challenging economic situation.' The firm was importing most of its car components and the rouble's fall has hit hard, along with plunging demand for vehicles. "Many people don't know what they will do in the future," says Trade Unionist Maxim Kulayev, who's negotiating for better compensation for 1,200 workers about to lose their livelihood. "The government says there's no problem, they can all find new job. But it isn't true." In fact, other manufacturers are also laying-off workers due to the downturn. "We think the crisis goes on," Mr Kulayev says. And Russia's influential former Finance Minister, Alexei Kudrin, agrees. He estimates that falling oil price and sanctions are equally to blame. "Russia is experiencing serious difficulties as we know. Growth has slowed, living standards have fallen. Of course it's difficult," he told the BBC. But he's still not convinced the sanctions can make any difference, politically. "Clearly they were meant to pressure Russia. But I don't think they worked because Putin doesn't respond to that kind of political pressure." The EU says its restrictions can be reversed when it sees Russia 'contributing actively and without ambiguities' to solving the Ukraine crisis. Russia is engaged in a peace process but continues to insist that Kiev - not Russian-backed rebels - is responsible for violating the ceasefire. Meanwhile, it remains officially indifferent to the sanctions. So the St. Petersburg economic forum was trumpeted as a great success, as state TV proclaimed a surge in participants as proof the West's attempt to isolate Moscow has failed. The volume of actual deals done, though, tells a different tale. The total value this year was calculated at $5.4 bn by the forum's executive secretary. That's $2bn less even than last year, when so many of the big players stayed away.	Already coping without EU cheese, Russians could soon be braced for life without its wine, fine chocolate and flowers.
The non-league club's ground at Meadow Park was completely submerged by the 2007 floods and they have been unable to play there since. The new ground will be a completely new build, within the boundaries of the old stadium, and will include flood defences. The plans will be submitted to Gloucester County Council next week. Club spokesman Mike Dunstan said: "We have regularly communicated with residents and can say that this flood defence proposal will give substantial and significant benefits to the residents and businesses of the Sudmeadow area. "GCFC flood risks consultants have been working on this proposal since 2008 with the EA (Environment Agency) to provide the solution." Since 2007 the club has played home games at the grounds of Forest Green Rovers, Cirencester Town and Cheltenham Town. Club chairman Nigel Hughes said: "I am especially pleased for our supporters who have, throughout this very difficult time, been wonderfully supportive and extremely patient with us. "There is still much work to be done but this gives us all a big lift and is something to work towards."	Plans to rebuild flood-damaged Gloucester City Football Club's stadium have gone on display.
Both Broughty Ferry lifeboats were called out shortly before midday, with a Coastguard helicopter later joining the search. Coastguard officers conducted a search on foot of the waterfront area close to the bridge. The lifeboats were stood down at about 15:00. A Broughty Ferry RNLI spokesman said: "The inshore lifeboat was launched within six minutes and was quickly in the area of the reported sighting. "The all-weather lifeboat Elizabeth of Glamis was launched a short time later to join the search. "Following an extensive search of the area no one was found."	A lifeboat and Coastguard search has been carried out after a report of a body seen in the water near the Tay Road Bridge at Dundee.
The 335ft (100m) Victorian structure, which closed last year, is one of the UK's shortest piers. Bryan Huxford, who co-owns Humberside Airport, said he would soon reopen the pier as a traditional entertainment venue. The pier sold at auction in March but was put back on the market in May after the sale fell through. Mr Huxford, who bought the pier for an undisclosed fee, said the venue would be "safeguarded for future community ownership". "This has the potential to be very exciting and could create jobs, boost skills and give people across North East Lincolnshire a venue to really be proud of," he said. "But we're not getting ahead of ourselves at this stage because we know the pier will only truly survive and thrive with the support of local people." Crafts, conferences, weddings A public consultation is expected to start next week to gauge interest in the project and decide on the pier's future use. Mr Huxford said the pier would have a number of uses including tearooms, craft market, wedding receptions, conferences and a traditional dance and concert hall. A steering group of seven business people has been set up to manage the pier while it recruits members of the public to create a community organisation. Mr Huxford said the organisation would takeover the running of the pier "with the ultimate aim of buying the building." Cleethorpes Pier, which was built at a cost of Â£8,000 and opened in 1873, has been empty since it closed last year and was previously used as a nightclub.	Cleethorpes Pier has been bought by a local businessman who intends to turn it into a community-run venue.
Smells of fresh sushi fill the meeting room, and Japanese artwork covers the walls of the house. Outside, traditional Japanese plants and water features make it feel more like Japan than Northern Ireland. Set up nearly two decades ago, in 1996, the group was formed to help Japanese people new to Northern Ireland to integrate, but its members say the society is about much more than that too. On Saturday, the society held its first meeting of the year. The society's secretary, Séan Greer, said many members joined because they had lived in Japan for a time. "I used to live in Japan, for about nine years in total, and I came back just at the end of 2003," he said. "I wanted to keep my contact with Japan, I heard about the society and looked them up. People are interested in Japanese culture for a lot of different reasons. "It might be the language, for a lot of people it's food, for a lot of younger people it's the animation and manga (Japanese cartoons). Everything they do seems to be a little bit different or sometimes very different from our own and therefore it's sort of endlessly fascinating." There was plenty of culture on show at the meeting, including a performance by a group of Japanese taiko drummers from Londonderry. One of the group's founders, Fiona Umetsu, said it was an exciting art form, mixing both music and performance. "Taiko is a part of nearly every Japanese festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer," she said. "When I lived there I saw it and thought it was amazing, and was lucky enough to be able to join a local group." The society was joined by a very special guest - students visiting Belfast from Rikkyo University in Tokyo joined in the festivities. For many of them, it was their first time visiting Belfast and they told me they were keen to stay. "Belfast is very fantastic and an exciting city, many students say they want to retire here in Northern Ireland," their professor said. The Japan society's chairperson, Junko McNeely, said the group provides a way for people who are learning Japanese to practise with native speakers. "The purpose is to introduce Japanese culture, anything like that to get local people interested in Japan, but it's also a place to communicate and have entertainment with Japanese people as well," she said. Séan Greer said the society also allows Japanese visitors to find out how the western world views their culture. "If you got to Japan the first question a Japanese person will ask you is:  "あなたは、日本どう思いますか", which means, 'what do you think of Japan?' and they're really curious about what others think of them," he said. "So when they come here they can learn a little bit more about that, and realise what non-Japanese people find interesting about Japan. "We ourselves are interested to know what other people think of Northern Ireland and we're keen to show them that it's a welcoming place as well."	Tucked away in a little guest house next to a manufacturing firm in Glengormley, County Antrim, members of the Japan Society of Northern Ireland chat away - some easily switching in and out of Japanese and English.
Russia's plan for "de-escalation" zones was backed by Iran at talks in Kazakhstan. Both countries support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out. Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor. The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had "only contributed to the violence, not stopped it". The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the "de-escalation zones". The objective is to "put an immediate end to the violence" and "provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.	Three countries backing different sides in Syria's war have agreed to set up "safe zones" in the country, while delegates for rebel forces stormed out in protest.
Captain David Seath, 31, was a fire support team commander in 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery. He suffered a suspected cardiac arrest while running the course and later died in hospital. He was laid to rest following a funeral in St Margaret's RC Memorial Church in Dunfermline. Hundreds of mourners gathered at the church for the service, which was led by parish priest Father Chris Heenan. Capt Seath was originally from Cowdenbeath in Fife. Maj Jim McCaffery, 7 (Sphinx) Commando Battery, which is based in Arbroath, told the service:  "It is with great sadness that were are here today to say farewell to Captain David Seath. "David was an inspiration to all of us. I genuinely could not have wished for a finer officer. "He will be sorely missed and our thoughts and prayers are with his family." During the service, Capt James Walker-McClimens read a tribute on behalf of Capt Seath's brother, Gary. He told the mourners: "David was my hero and my inspiration. I was so proud to say that he was a Captain in 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and that he served his country with distinction in Afghanistan and the Middle East. "Words can't express how proud I was listening to him as he described his tours of Afghanistan and the Middle East. "I learnt so much about David's tours of duty, the strong bond of comradeship he had found in the Army as well as the many plans he had for the future. "There are no words to express how devastated I am that this story has so tragically ended, with so many chapters left unwritten." A family notice published in the Dunfermline Press said the service would be a "celebration of David's life" and urged mourners to wear bright colours. Capt Seath fell ill at the 23-mile mark while taking part in the race. Following his death, Capt Seath's friends and colleagues vowed to continue to raise money for Help for Heroes and walk the final three miles of the marathon course. More than Â£100,000 has been donated to a JustGiving page in his memory while about Â£80,000 has been raised for the charity on his own page.	The funeral of an Afghanistan veteran and Green Beret who died after collapsing during the London Marathon has been held in Dunfermline, Fife.
It will sell investments worth £12m in firms where more than 10% of revenue comes from extracting thermal coal or the production of oil from tar sands. The Church said it had a "moral responsibility" to act on environmental issues to protect the poor, who were the most vulnerable to climate change. The Church manages three investment funds worth about £8bn. "Climate change is already a reality," said Rev Canon Professor Richard Burridge, deputy chair of the Church's Ethical Investment Advisory Group (EIAG). "The Church has a moral responsibility to speak and act on both environmental stewardship and justice for the world's poor who are most vulnerable to climate change," he said. "This responsibility encompasses not only the Church's own work to reduce our own carbon footprint, but also how the Church's money is invested and how we engage with companies on this vital issue." Analysis: Helen Briggs, environment correspondent With the global campaign to move money out of fossil fuels gaining momentum, the Church of England's commitment to divest for the first time from the most polluting forms of energy is being seen as a significant step. The church joins several UK institutions that have already signed up to the movement, including Glasgow University and the British Medical Association. But for some, the announcement does not go far enough. The Church of England says it will withdraw investments worth £12m from companies that make money from extracting thermal coal - used in generating electricity - or producing oil from tar sands. This is but a fraction of its total investment portfolio and some are already calling for the church to go further by divesting from all fossil fuels. But the church takes the view that engaging with fossil fuel companies is productive for other forms of energy, such as oil and gas, which may be needed as the world moves towards a low-carbon economy. The new policy "marks the start of a process of divestment as well as engagement with fossil fuel companies and better aligns the Church's investment practice with its belief, theology and practice", added Bishop Nick Holtam, who is the Church of England's lead bishop on environment. The Church said it also wanted more intensive engagement with companies that made a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. It recently filed shareholder resolutions at BP and Shell calling for more transparency over climate change. Christian Aid's director of policy and public affairs, Christine Allen, said the policy ought to prompt energy firms to rethink their businesses: "The openness to further divestment from intransigent companies must be heard as a final warning to the energy industry: shift investment out of fossil fuels and into renewables or your investors will do so for you. "Every pound divested by churches, public institutions or individuals is a sign that we are serious." The Church of England does not directly invest in tobacco, pornography or payday lenders. Two years ago, it emerged that the Church had indirectly invested in Wonga - which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, admitted to being "embarrassed and irritated" about. It has since ended that investment.	The Church of England is adopting a new climate change policy and will cut its investments in fossil fuel companies.
Speaking in Vienna, US Secretary of State John Kerry said world powers would back Libya in seeking exemption from a UN arms embargo. He said IS was a "new threat" to Libya and it was "imperative" it was stopped. Last month, the Libyan government warned that IS could seize most of the country if it was not halted soon. After holding talks with international partners, Mr Kerry said: "The GNA [Government of National Accord] is the only entity that can unify the country. It is the only way to ensure that vital institutions... fall under representative and acknowledged authority. "It is the only way to generate the cohesion necessary to defeat Daesh [IS]." The requested arms embargo "exemption" for Libya will need to be approved by the UN Sanctions Committee before it comes into force. But the Libyan government's formal request for it signals that they have been given assurances that it would soon be approved. Libya remains a country where multiple administrations are still bickering over who is in charge.  Armed groups in western Libya, reputed for their shifting allegiances, only loosely back the new government, and there is no clear chain of command. There is a risk that future arms shipments will either fall into the wrong hands, or exacerbate the civil conflict there between rival militias. Mr Kerry said support for arming the government was part of a package of measures agreed at the meeting, which included accelerating non-military aid to Libya. He said that as well as countering IS, the GNA should take full control of Libyan ministries, backed by the international community. A joint statement from the countries attending drew attention to Libya's role as a major transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe. "We look forward to partnering with the GNA and neighbouring countries to tackle the threat posed throughout the Mediterranean and on its land borders by criminal organisations engaged in all forms of smuggling and trafficking, including in human beings," it said. "We are ready to respond to the Libyan government's requests for training and equipping the presidential guard and vetted forces from throughout Libya." But the prime minister of Libya's unity government, Fayez Sarraj, warned major challenges lay ahead, saying taking on IS would require further outside help. "We urge the international community to assist us," he said. "We are not talking about international intervention, we are talking about international assistance in training, equipping our troops and training our youths." The North African country has been in chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-time ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Until recently it had two rival governments competing for power, and there are still hundreds of militias, some allied to IS. Western nations hope the unity government will take on IS, which has a foothold in Sirte - the home town of Gaddafi. The militant group has launched a series of suicide bombings and attacks on oil facilities in the country.	The US and other world powers have said they are ready to arm Libya's UN-backed unity government to help it fight the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group.
Mr Oyston sued Stephen Reed over material posted on a fans' webzine, Back Henry Street, in June 2015. Mr Justice Langstaff in the High Court in Manchester ruled Mr Oyston was blameless and Mr Reed's allegation was untrue. The verdict comes the day after the club was relegated to League Two. Mr Reed's website posting claimed the club chairman entered into a foul-mouthed rant at him in public, held a gun in such a way as to make Mr Reed believe he was about to be shot at and had assaulted Mr Reed and put him in fear for his safety or even his life. The judge said judgment for Mr Oyston was entered in August 2015 and Mr Reed now accepted the club chairman did not brandish a gun at Mr Reed, who maintained had not lied about the incident since he had given his honest opinion. In ruling Mr Oyston was blameless, the judge added that further libel had not been discouraged by an award in an earlier action brought by Mr Oyston against another supporter, David Ragozzino. The judge said the effect appeared to have been "to stir up, and maintain, resentment of and hostility" toward Mr Oyston and his wife Victoria. He ordered Mr Reed to pay Mr Oyston £30,000 and his legal costs. Mr Reed was among a number of Blackpool supporters unhappy about the way the Oyston family have run the football club. Fans have held regular protests and boycotted games over the past two seasons. Mr Oyston was fined £40,000 in June and banned from football activity for six weeks by the Football Association for five breaches of aggravated misconduct after sending abusive and insulting text messages to a fan.	Blackpool Football Club's chairman Karl Oyston has won £30,000 in libel damages from an abusive fan who claimed Mr Oyston threatened him with a shotgun.
Emily Gardner, 14, from Gloucester, drowned when an ill-fitting buoyancy aid snagged on a speedboat which capsized in Brixham, Devon in May 2015. Parents Clive and Debbie Gardner set up Emily's Code to highlight safety issues for small boat owners and users. They said something as simple as checking a buoyancy aid or lifejacket fits properly could save a life. Emily was with two friends and her best friend's father, Paul Pritchard, on a 16ft (4.8m) speedboat when a wave hit the vessel, causing it to overturn. An inquest into Emily's death heard all four were thrown into the water. Emily was trapped underneath the boat after one of the straps on her buoyancy aid caught on a cleat. Mr and Mrs Gardner said: "Many parents like us have no awareness of recreational boating safety guidelines and have never used a boat before. "When Emily went on a day trip with her friends we were reassured that safety was paramount and that the equipment was top notch. "If just one family sees this and takes action to protect their children on the water, then Emily's Code will have succeeded and Emily's name will live on." The code has the backing of the Royal Yachting Association, HM Coastguard, British Water Ski and Wakeboard, and the RNLI. Emily's Code:	The family of a teenage girl who drowned on a sailing trip have launched a safety code in her memory.
The All Blacks were almost out of sight at half-time, Julian Savea scoring two tries and Brodie Retallick and Nehe Milner-Skudder one apiece. A try by Louis Picamoles had kept France afloat but when he was sent to the sin-bin French hopes evaporated. Savea completed a fine hat-trick and Jerome Kaino, Kieran Read and Tawera Kerr-Barlow (two) also crossed. France had hoped to draw inspiration from their World Cup upsets over the All Blacks in 1999 and 2007, when they beat them in the quarter-finals in Cardiff, as well as their near-miss in the 2011 final, when they narrowly lost 8-7. But New Zealand, who have now beaten France nine times in a row and equalled Australia's record of 12 consecutive World Cup wins, never looked like losing against a Philippe Saint-Andre side forced to deny they are in outright rebellion. And while the French simply did not have the requisite talent or a game-plan to trouble New Zealand, the performance of Steve Hansen's side was undoubtedly the most impressive of the tournament so far. New Zealand started in breathless fashion and Dan Carter translated their pressure into three points after Thierry Dusautoir was penalised for not releasing. France were level almost immediately, full-back Scott Spedding slotting a penalty from inside his own half, before second-row Retallick charged down a Freddie Michalak clearance kick and romped over for New Zealand's first try. The All Blacks were nullified for a while by some stout French defence, until Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith, playing their 60th Test together in the centres, fed the ball to the brilliant Milner-Skudder, who conjured a try from nothing, stepping off his right foot and leaving the French defence for dead. And when Savea went over for New Zealand's 300th World Cup try, after a wonderful back-of-the-hand offload from Carter, France looked doomed. Picamoles, France's inspirational number eight, had other ideas and latched onto a loose pass in front of New Zealand's posts and barged over, but when he was sin-binned for putting his fist in a prone Richie McCaw's face soon after the restart, the French challenge evaporated. Savea had already grabbed his second just before half-time, the 6ft 4in, 17-stone wing displaying great strength to smash through three tackles and score his seventh try of the tournament. And after Picamoles' departure Kaino trotted over unopposed before Savea finished from 40 metres out to equal Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana's record of eight tries in an individual tournament and make it 38 tries in 39 Tests. Some cute interplay between Charlie Faumuina and number eight Read ended with the latter touching down next to the posts, before replacement scrum-half Kerr-Barlow came off the bench to grab a clinical double as the world champions ran riot. New Zealand rarely clicked despite topping Pool C, but four competitive matches appear to have been exactly what they needed in terms of sharpening them up for the knockout stages. South Africa, who were shocked by Japan in their opening World Cup game, have mounted a stirring recovery and are battle-hardened after a bruising quarter-final victory over Wales. But the All Blacks appear to have too much variety for the one-dimensional Springboks, who have beaten New Zealand only twice in their last 12 meetings. Such a chastening defeat might be the best thing that could have happened to French rugby after the insipid reign of Saint-Andre. When Toulouse coach Guy Noves takes over, the first thing he will have to address is his country's rugby philosophy, which is now less about flair and more about brute force, which on its own is rarely enough at the highest level. However, Noves's biggest challenge will be attempting to persuade French clubs playing in the Top 14, who are often successful in European competition, to play in a more expansive manner. The post-mortem will be long and cruel. New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen: "It was a very pleasing performance and everyone from number one to 23 played their part. "We can't wait [to play South Africa]. We're playing against great opposition. They are a great team and we enjoy their company and we will enjoy playing them." New Zealand captain Richie McCaw: "The intensity was always going to go up a notch and we talked about it all week about needing to be up a notch. "I am just proud of the guys, especially at the start of the game, we got on to it and applied pressure right around the field." France head coach Philippe Saint-Andre: "Of course they [fans] are disappointed. I think we did the maximum, we tried and today New Zealand were much better than us. "We worked hard for the last three months to be in this World Cup but each time we made a mistake New Zealand punished us. "When the result is like this you have nothing to say and just congratulate New Zealand." New Zealand: B Smith, Milner-Skudder, C Smith, Nonu, Savea, Carter, A.

Sir Philip, owner of clothing retailer Arcadia Group, will examine expenditure from the past three years to try to identify potential savings. He told the BBC more centralised buying by government departments might help. But the appointment was criticised by the GMB union - who said that Sir Philip's wife, the direct owner of Arcadia, lives in a tax haven. Sir Philip owns more than 2,000 shops in the UK, including BHS and Topshop, which are estimated to make up some 12% of the nation's clothing retail market. His conclusions will inform the wider Comprehensive Spending Review due in October. Sir Philip Green is one of the UK's most successful retailers. With a personal fortune of more than £4bn, he owns the Arcadia Group, whose fashion chains include Topshop, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Miss Selfridge. In 2009 Arcadia made pre-tax profits of £213.6m, 13% higher than the previous year. Sir Philip also owns department store chain BHS, whose fortunes he has transformed since he purchased the then ailing company in 2000. The government will be hoping that Sir Philip can transfer his renowned ability to trim costs from the private sector to the civil service. He will also bring a proven record in procurement, and aims to reduce the cost of the government's purchasing contracts. However, despite Sir Philip's successes, his appointment may still raise eyebrows. His wife Tina is the direct owner of Arcadia, and she is officially a resident of Monaco. This enabled her to gain a tax-free £1.2bn dividend in 2005. Sir Philip also made headlines in 2004 when he made a failed hostile takeover bid for Marks and Spencer. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had "no idea" how much could be saved yet, but added: "We need to get ourselves focused on the big spending, where is the money actually being spent. "I think in the past, occasionally having had discussions on this, there is not central procurement. "So the thought process of us having an individual buyer in each one of our stores without centralising the purchasing, will give you some idea, hopefully, of the opportunity. "But it's about process as well, so we need to understand the process, how it's done, who does what and how we can quicken all of that up." But his appointment was criticised by Paul Kenny, head of the GMB union, who  pointed out that Sir Philip's wife - the named owner of Arcadia - lives in the tax haven of Monaco. He said: "If we were seeking advice about marketing or selling clothes he is someone you might ask. This is about the health, education and care of millions of our fellow citizens - not about importing cheap clothing." And the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants, said: "It's not that surprising that the millionaires in the cabinet have appointed a billionaire to say that their cuts, which will devastate communities in the UK, are 'fair'." But Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude defended Sir Philip's appointment, saying he had a "sharp eye for detail" and could guide the government on contracts and leases signed up to in future. "He's shown how he can turn around big complex businesses. Government is a huge complex organisation, and while it's not the same as a business, a lot of the same disciplines are needed," he added. Asked about the tax status of his wife, Sir Philip told the BBC: "My wife's not a tax exile - my family do not live in the United Kingdom, it's somewhat different." He added: "We do pay all our tax in Britain. I think we have paid over the last five years some £300-400m in taxes on profits that have been made on our company. "I'm a UK taxpayer, I work here every week, we employ 45,000 people in the UK and we have got a £500m payroll." Sir Philip will be supported by a team of civil servants and report to Mr Maude and Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander - who said the review would help the government "totally re-think" the way it spends public money.	Billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green is to lead a review of government spending - amid criticism from unions.
The state newspaper says the "suave" liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, despite boasting 30%-40% alcohol. The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called insam and glutinous rice, and cultivated by an organic farming method. North Korean media is known for making often outlandish claims about its domestic achievements. Last year, it said medical products containing extracts from the insam plant could cure Mers, Sars and even Aids, NK News reported. The Pyongyang Times said the new alcohol "exudes national flavour", without dampening your national fervour the following morning. Among its other unique selling points, according to the paper - the spirit "is highly appreciated by experts and lovers". The newspaper article, titled, "Liquor wins quality medal for preserving national smack", says the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory has been working for years on the elixir. The drink derives from Kaesong Koryo insam - a natural herb thought to have medicinal properties. According to the Pyongyang Times, replacing sugar with the scorched, glutinous rice removed the bitterness from the insam and, crucially, the hangover. "Koryo Liquor, which is made of six-year-old Kaesong Koryo insam, known as being highest in medicinal effect, and the scorched rice, is highly appreciated by experts and lovers as it is suave and causes no hangover," the article reads. The liquor "has already been registered as a national scientific and technological hit", it adds. Andray Abrahamian, who travels to North Korea on business for Chosong Exchange, told the UK-based North Korean News website that insam liquors were "OK"  but he is "not that keen on it as a tasty treat". "There are some high quality liquors made in North Korea, though in my experience there is no such thing as hangover-free booze anywhere in the world," he said.	North Korean scientists have invented a hangover-free alcohol, according to the Pyongyang Times.
The Alabama Securities Commission led the investigation, which helps prevent financial fraud against the elderly. After an agent interviewed Lee, the commission's head said he was satisfied she wanted a second book published. The new work - Go Set a Watchman - will be the 88-year-old American author's first release since the 1960s. The surprise move prompted some suggestions Lee was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript, which was discovered by her lawyer in the author's possessions last year. "We closed the file. Let's just say that she was able to answer questions we asked to our satisfaction from our point of view,'' said Joseph Borg, Alabama Securities Commission director. The New York Times reported that the investigation was sparked by requests from a doctor that the state investigate whether Lee was capable to have consented to the release of the work. Lee herself was "extremely hurt" by allegations she was manipulated, her lawyer Tonja Carter said. To Kill a Mockingbird was published in July 1960 and has sold more than 40 million copies around the world. Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, and features many of the same characters, with an adult Scout Finch returning to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father.	US investigators have closed an inquiry into whether To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee was pressured into publishing a sequel.
Adam Purinton, 51, fled the scene of the attack at a pub in Olathe and went to a restaurant where he confided in a staff member, police say. He was arraigned in court on Monday with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. The accused wore a safety smock to prevent him from harming himself. Police say he shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibholta at a pub on Wednesday evening. He allegedly fired on Mr Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani, two 32-year-old Indian men who worked as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin. Mr Kuchibhotla died and Mr Madasani survived. A third patron, 24-year-old Ian Grillot, was wounded trying to intervene. The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime. After the attack at Austins Bar and Grill, the suspect, who is white, drove 70 miles (112km) to an Applebee's in Clinton, Missouri, where he allegedly admitted what he had done to an employee. On Saturday at 11am, the doors of Austin Bar and Grill reopened, after a fatal shooting which has shaken people here in Olathe and beyond. "We've come back to show we won't let the attacker change our way of life," said one patron who'd turned up. Austins is your regular local bar in a strip mall. It serves the usual diet of fried food and beers, with sport on big screens. But, Austins is now also the place which robbed one man of his life, and left two others injured. As Alok Madasani sat in pain in his living room, nursing an injury caused by the bullet which struck his thigh, he told me how he and Srinivas were so well known at the bar the staff knew how much ice they took in their drinks. Until that fateful night, he said he'd never heard anyone use overtly racist language in Olathe. And many other Indians I met at a vigil on Friday night echoed that sentiment. They said Olathe has always been a friendly and welcoming place. One man said he hoped this tragedy was a "one-off", and that the show of support here would help heal the many hearts, which have been broken. In a 911 call, a bartender, Sam Suida, told the police dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said he'd done something "really bad" and that he was on the run. "He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldn't tell me what he did," she says on a recording of the call. "I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me. "Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe." The shooting drew worldwide attention and has gripped the Indian-American community. Hillary Clinton weighed in on the matter on Twitter on Monday, demanding President Donald Trump speak out against intolerance following the shooting. "With threats & hate crimes on rise, we shouldn't have to tell @POTUS to do his part. He must step up & speak out," the former Democratic presidential candidate tweeted. Mr Trump has yet to comment, but his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Monday that early reports on the Kansas shooting were "disturbing". Witnesses said the suspect shouted "get out of my country" before shots rang out. Mr Madasani told the BBC the gunman had demanded to know if they were in the country legally. The suspect is being held in the Johnson County Jail on a bond of $2m (Â£1.6m). His next court appearance is on 9 March.	A man arrested last week for shooting two Indians at a Kansas bar allegedly told a barmaid he had just opened fire on some "Iranian people".
There may be clashes, but a series of deals between Labour and the government have defused most of the big problems in advance. I've lost count of the number of times Labour's point person, Keir Starmer uttered the words: "I am grateful for that indication," as the Security Minister John Hayes announced changes. Today's big compromise announcement will be the composition and remit of the panel which will assess the operational case for the powers, under the leadership of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC. This matters because the panel have to report by the time the bill reaches committee stage in the House of Lords, and if they called for significant changes that would be pretty hard for ministers to resist. That follows on from the government accepting special protections for Trade Unions and from a government "manuscript amendment" on the role of the "Judicial Commissioners" who would co-sign warrants for investigatory powers - which would allow them to scrutinise the facts of the case, not just the reasonableness of the process by which a warrant was issued. In both cases Labour got pretty much everything they asked for. Further compromise may well emerge on the issue of keeping internet connection records and the level of access to them, and on the protection of medical records. Protection of journalists and their sources seems a tougher issue - although some suspect that the government would like a few compromise-able issues in its back pocket, so that it can throw a few bones to their lordships, when the bill is considered in detail in the Upper House. I suspect Labour will probably vote for the bill at tonight's third reading - perhaps with a few reservations, while the SNP and probably the Lib Dems will oppose. And then the action switches to the Lords.	Day two of MPs' detailed consideration of the Investigatory Powers Bill - and the issues of the day should be the retention of internet connection records and protection of medical records and journalistic privilege.
Zohore's double helped Cardiff to a 3-1 win over Ipswich Town as the Denmark U21 striker took his tally to nine goals in his last 10 league games. "I wouldn't swap him for many in the Championship," said Warnock. "He's got every attribute and you can't coach what he has got." Warnock believes his management has been key in getting the best out of Zohore. "There was not a player here like that when I came here," Warnock told BBC Wales Sport. "He was not a waste of time, but he wasn't far away from being a waste of time. "He walked about, wouldn't tackle, wouldn't chase back and he wore gloves everywhere. "You name it really. "But he's a good lad and the chat I had with him against Wolves at half-time (in December) was obviously vital, because he's been a revelation since then." Warnock says the transformation in Zohore's game is comparable to that of some Premier League and international players he has worked with in his lengthy managerial career. "Oh yeah, Victor Moses (now at Chelsea) was one, there have been a few players who surprised me," Warnock said. "A few that didn't realise (how good they could be). Phil Jagielka (Everton and England) is another, when I first got hold of him. "Some lads don't believe in themselves and need convincing. "The minimum you should get out of a player is 100%. Then the ability goes on top. "You need that work ethic at any level of the game. "When you do that, you make your own luck, as Gary Player used to say." However, Warnock is unconcerned that rival clubs might be looking at Zohore, who he has previously stated was not for sale, even at £20 million. "He will not be going anywhere," added Warnock. "I am happy with that. They won't sell him behind my back, I will tell you that. "I think Vincent (Tan) is enjoying it as much as me." Warnock also feels he has improved winger Kadeem Harris, whose direct running led to Cardiff's third goal. "He's another one like Ken, I think he needs me more than I need him," he said. "I thought he'd been here six months, but he's been here three or four years," "So he's been a waste of time, hasn't he? So hopefully the penny drops and he stays with us. "I have talked to his dad a couple of times. Sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side, but if I was Kadeem, I would be looking to stay here. "He has someone who believes in him and gives him a chance."	Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock says Kenneth Zohore is one of the best strikers in the Championship after being "not far away from being a waste of time" just a few months ago.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
In laboratory tests, two sweetgrass compounds drove mosquitoes away from tantalising fake blood samples, just as well as the widely-used repellent Deet. Further tests are needed to see how long the effects last. The researchers say folk remedies are a rich source of possible new repellents. "This is the fourth plant that we've investigated in this manner," said Charles Cantrell, a research chemist who works for the US Department of Agriculture. "The neat thing about this one is that it produces a compound, coumarin, which has a great odour and was known... to have some repelling properties. And it's very safe." Dr Cantrell was speaking in Boston at the 250th national meeting of the American Chemical Society. "There's an interesting story about coumarin," he told journalists at the conference. "Back in the 90s, Avon 'Skin So Soft' had a product that people discovered actually worked well as an insect repellent. It wasn't marketed as an insect repellent, but the effectiveness was well-known among consumers. "Scientists did an investigation and one of the constituents in Skin So Soft was coumarin - which we've now isolated from sweetgrass." Despite this, coumarin is not currently registered or marketed as a repellent, Dr Cantrell said. The second key ingredient he and his colleagues identified in sweetgrass was phytol, a common constituent in essential oils from plants. Phytol, similarly, is known to repel insects but is not currently marketed for that purpose. Dr Cantrell's team isolated these chemicals from the grass by passing steam through it, separating the oily and volatile compounds and then further purifying them into 12 fractions. Those 12 samples were presented to mosquitoes in a special test. "The bioassay is designed to mimic human skin," Dr Cantrell explained. "You put a blood mimic in a little well and cover it with a membrane." That membrane is then perfumed with the chemical to be tested, and the researchers simply count the bites. "We'll have five mosquitoes per little chamber. You can watch them bite the membrane, but for final confirmation... you squash them, to see which ones contain the red dye." Once these results were in, the team identified the specific molecules involved using spectrometry. Coumarin and phytol were the stand-outs, Dr Cantrell said. "In this three minute time-frame, measuring the number of bites, they were just as effective as Deet." The next step is to test them over a more practical timeframe. "We don't know yet what the duration of repellency is. It may work well in our bioassay for three minutes, but how does it work for three hours? "These are questions that we're going to try to answer over the next year or two."

Investment in TV drama has fallen by 44% since the last review in 2008. The report found that "the drops in the levels of investment, particularly on ITV, are a concern". The media watchdog's review found spending on children's programmes in the UK had also fallen from £103m in 2008 to £88m in 2014. The BBC now accounts for 97% (£84m) of total public service broadcasting spending on children's programmes. Spending by ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 on children's TV has dropped by 74% to £3m in 2014. The review points out there is "very limited provision of non-animation programming beyond the BBC". The review found that, despite the success of big budget dramas like Downtown Abbey and Doctor Who, the amount of new UK drama being shown on the main channels has fallen from 627 hours in 2008 to 371 hours in 2014. Although it noted that "audience satisfaction with drama is stable". The review found that - following the removal of specific quotas in 2003 - public service programmes in arts and classical music, religion and ethics, and formal education has significantly reduced. Ofcom also warned broadcasters need to adapt as the trend towards online viewing grows. The watchdog found that unless the main TV channels adapt their business models, they would struggle to pay for public service programming in the future. Ofcom warned another challenge for the broadcasters in the future will be delivering news to younger audiences, as viewing of TV news has fallen by 29% among people aged 16-34. It also found certain audience groups were concerned about how they were portrayed on screen - particularly people from BAME backgrounds or people with disabilities - either being under-represented or unfairly portrayed. However, the review found that general audience satisfaction  was high with 79% believing PSB was delivering on its purposes, such as delivering trustworthy news and high quality programming reflecting the UK. That figure is up from 69% in 2008. The review also found PSB channels continue to make a significant contribution to UK broadcasting. In 2013, they invested just over £2bn in new UK programmes, not including sports content, compared to around £350m from non-PSB companies. The main UK TV channels, BBC, ITV, STV, UTV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C, all carry programmes with public service values. Over half of all TV viewing is on these main channels - but that figure rises to more than 70% when the time shifted channels are taken into account.	An Ofcom review into public service broadcasting (PSB) in the UK has raised concerns about a fall in spending on drama and children's programming.
The RNLI says six crew members have been brought in from the UK to staff the St Helier station in Jersey. The charity said the decision to remove coxswain Andy Hibbs was made due to a "serious risk to its ability to run a safe and effective lifesaving service".

Hernandez, 24, has signed a three-year deal, which the Tigers have the option of extending for a further 12 months. Hull's previous record transfer outlay was the £8m they paid Tottenham for midfielder Jake Livermore in June. They also completed the signings of midfielders Mohamed Diame from West Ham and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton. Hernandez has scored seven goals in 14 matches for Uruguay and made two appearances at the 2014 Fifa World Cup. Tigers boss Steve Bruce said: "Abel is a fantastic signing and highlights just how far the club has come in such a short space of time. "He is an exciting talent and, like myself, I'm sure the supporters can't wait to see him in action." Hernandez, who scored 14 goals in 28 appearances to help Palermo win promotion to Italy's Serie A last season, arrives following the £12m sale of Shane Long to Southampton. His signing takes Hull's summer spending beyond £30m. Ben Arfa, a 27-year-old France international winger, has spent the past three seasons on Tyneside, having joined the Magpies from Marseille in January 2011 following a successful loan spell. "Hatem is a superb addition to the squad, and brings a lot of attacking flair," said manager Steve Bruce. Ben Arfa made 86 appearances for Newcastle, scoring 14 goals.	Hull City have signed Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez from Palermo for a club-record £10m fee, while Hatem Ben Arfa has joined on loan from Newcastle.

The woman, aged in her 20s, was attacked after leaving the event's Chinawhite enclosure early on Sunday, with men she met there. She walked with them to the Harpsden Road and Reading Road area and was raped outside a car, which the men then drove off in. A passerby found the victim near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after. Daniel Grist, secretary of the regatta, said: "We have been liaising with Thames Valley Police, regarding this terrible incident, which took place after Regatta facilities had closed and racing had finished for the day on Saturday 1 July. "The Chinawhite area is not located on land managed by Henley Royal Regatta but we will continue to assist Thames Valley Police and are working with them to secure CCTV footage to assist in identifying the perpetrators." Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses, and specially-trained officers are supporting the woman, who left the Chinawhite enclosure between 00:00 and 02:30 BST. Det Ch Insp Lis Knight said such incidents were rare in the area. The Â£3m rowing regatta sees more than 200 races take place on the river Thames over five days. The annual regatta, which has been held since 1839, was expected to attract 200,000 spectators to this year's event.	Organisers of the Henley Royal Regatta are supplying hours of CCTV footage to police after a woman was raped.
We already know Bridesmaids director Paul Feig is rebooting the franchise, with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy leading a female-fronted cast. But the director of the original movie has suggested it will only be the start of a whole new franchise. Ivan Reitman has told Deadline.com that he wants to "expand the Ghostbusters universe". According to him, that will include "different films, TV shows, merchandise... all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment". Nothing is confirmed but Channing Tatum is one of the names rumoured to be up for a role. Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot is due out in 2016 with Saturday Night Live's Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon joining Wiig and McCarthy. Now, Sony Pictures, along with Reitman and original star Dan Aykroyd, are thought to be setting up a Ghost Corps production company which would oversee the output. Reitman suggests that the Russo Brothers, who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, would direct what would then be a fourth Ghostbusters film. The writer would be Drew Pearce, who wrote Iron Man 3 and Mission Impossible 5. Quoted by film website Deadline, Reitman said: "Paul Feig's film will be the first version of that. He's got four of the funniest women in the world, and there will be other surprises to come. "Drew (Pearce) will start writing and the hope is to be ready for the Russo Brothers' next window next summer to shoot, with the movie coming out the following year. It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies." If Ghostbusters does go down that route, then it would be similar to the way Marvel has set out a whole schedule of interconnecting films.

He was elected with 571 votes, ahead of Michael Henderson and David Noakes with 184 and 109 votes respectively. A total of 883 (27%) of the 3,220 registered voters turned out with four blank papers and 15 spoilt papers. Mr Parkinson will serve for four months and said there were "very important decisions" to be made in that time. Before the by-election some criticism was made of the Â£50,000 cost, a fifth of a general election, for the short term of the office - the by-election had to be held under the island's Reform Law. Mr Parkinson said: "The voters of St Peter Port North deserve to be represented every bit as strongly as the voters of any other district. "These next four months will set the scene for the general election, it will help to define the issues on which the general election will be fought." Mr Parkinson served in the States from 2004-2012 and was the minister of Treasury of Resources from 2008-2012. He previously stood in the South East district and said he had "enjoyed biking around getting to know the St Peter Port North district better" while campaigning. He campaigned with three key policies; diversifying the economy, reforming the corporate tax system and solving the affordable housing crisis. His term of office will end at the general election on 27 April. The by-election was called after the death of Deputy Martin Storey in July.	Former treasury minister Charles Parkinson is returning to the States of Guernsey after winning the St Peter Port North by-election.
The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had "ironclad information" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and "pushed hard" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was "just not true", but he hoped the resolution would "serve as a wake-up call" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements "has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. "It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel," he said. "We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict." Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as "misleading critiques" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution "paves the way" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. "We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation," he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.	An Israeli committee has postponed a vote to authorise construction of almost 500 new homes in Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem.
"This film will help bridge the gap between people of the Indian mainland and those from the north-eastern states," Mary Kom told the BBC. The five-time world champion is from the remote northeast state of Manipur. Bhansali, who has been planning the film for a year, described the boxer as an "inspiration to every Indian woman". "I am very impressed with the way Mary Kom is leading her life with so much conviction and courage. We'll start working on the film very soon. I haven't decided on who will play her role," Bhansali told the BBC. Recently, thousands of north-eastern people fled the Indian cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad fearing reprisal attacks in the wake of ethnic clashes between Bodo tribes and Muslims in the north-eastern state of Assam. The boxer says she has been worried about her relatives and friends living in Bangalore and "could not properly sleep at night when this exodus was taking place". The mother of twin boys feels that Bhansali's film on her will help clear the air because "our people look different but they are Indians. We have the same passions when the country is involved". Bhansali's assistant Omung Kumar, who researched Mary Kom's life and wrote the script, will direct the film. But will it be possible to screen the movie in the boxer's home state Manipur, where separatist rebels have imposed a ban on Bollywood films? "I hope nobody will object to a film if it centres on my life story, my struggles to become a boxer," Mary Kom said. India's thriving film industry has rarely picked on themes from the country's long-embattled north-eastern states and the few films that have been made have focused on the separatist insurgencies and India's counter-insurgency efforts in the region.	Indian Olympics bronze medallist, boxer MC Mary Kom, has welcomed a film that Bollywood director Sanjay Leela Bhansali wants to make on her life.

The pair performed above their world ranking of 22nd to reach Tuesday's semi-final, losing to fourth seeds Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan of China. Langridge said: "When we got to 14-7 in the last game, I thought: 'We might win this! We are going to win this!'" He added: "Luckily Marcus was quite calm, which helped a lot." In a dramatic finale, a review on the final point was required to seal the victory. "I can't even describe how I felt after we saw that," said Ellis. "This is an incredible feeling. After how we performed in our very first match, we knew we could compete with anybody." Team GB have now won 52 medals in Rio.

Bailly is due to have a medical this week and terms are thought to have been agreed with the 22-year-old, who will cost the Red Devils about £30m. He has played 40 times in La Liga, the first five of which were for Espanyol. Bailly joined Villarreal for £4.4m in January 2015 and played in every game as Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations just weeks later. It had been thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be Mourinho's first signing since the Portuguese succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager. The Sweden striker, 34, is a free agent after leaving Paris St-Germain and hinted at the weekend he would make an announcement about his future on Tuesday. But he has refused to elaborate, saying: "There is no confirmation. Keep wondering. I am enjoying the stories." Bailly's reputation has soared this season, which saw him play a key role as Villarreal sealed Champions League qualification, and it's no surprise to see him make a big-money move this summer. His prime asset is his extremely impressive physical presence, with his powerful aerial ability complimenting his pace and strength in the tackle. The brave and determined 22-year-old has less than 50 league games under his belt, though, so United fans should perhaps not expect him to immediately become an automatic starter. He can sometimes concede possession in dangerous areas by making bad decisions, and he doesn't always show composure under pressure, but Bailly possesses all the physical tools and the rest should come with more experience.

Konta beat world number 60 Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-4 6-7 (11-13) 6-3. Her next opponent will be another Czech, Katerina Siniakova, who beat Serbian Nina Stojanovic 6-3 6-4. Siniakova caused a surprise in the second round by defeating second seed Simona Halep. Konta looked in control early on against her opponent - the twin sister of world number six Karolina Pliskova - as she took the first set with a single break of serve. Neither player could force a break point in the second set and in the resulting tie-break Konta wasted two match points before the big-serving Pliskova levelled the match on her fifth set point. But Konta stayed firm in the final set, claiming the break and reaching the semi-final on her fifth match point. "I am very happy to have extended my stay here," she said. "She is one of the best servers on tour so I knew I was going to have a hard time on her service games. I was very happy I was able to get that break in the third and see it out in the end."	British number one Johanna Konta continued her good start to 2017 by reaching the semi-finals of the Shenzhen Open in China.
Nadine Foster, 18, was a passenger in a Ford Focus when it hit a wall in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, in April. She was taken to hospital but died a few days later, police said. Dylan Stringer, 22, and Joseph Chance, 24, both from Stourbridge, are accused of causing death by dangerous driving and are due before magistrates in Walsall on Wednesday. Mr Stringer, of Wychbury Road, and Mr Chance, of Murcroft Road, are also charged with causing death by driving a vehicle unlicensed and uninsured in relation to the crash in Hagley Road.

Hywel Dda director of operations Joe Teape said all hospitals were full following a busy bank holiday weekend. He said there were a high number of patients who needed to be admitted which put pressure on impatient beds. Mr Teape thanked staff for "working tirelessly" and asked people to "bear with them at this busy time." In a statement the health board said additional medical staff were working to ensure "all patients had a senior medical review" both in A&E and on the wards. Community teams are also at the hospitals to support patients on discharge. The health board said it had to cancel some "non-urgent planned operations" on Tuesday and will review Wednesday's operations during the day. "Every winter we deal with a number of seasonal pressures," Mr Teape said. "To mitigate the demand on services, we have a winter plan to ensure that services continue to run as smoothly as possible while ensuring that patients' needs continue to be met 24 hours a day." He added that local communities could help by making using of NHS services such as pharmacies rather than visiting A&E departments, where appropriate.	A health board has brought in extra staff and cancelled some operations in an attempt to manage "significant pressures".
Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but "driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be "less of it". "The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. "People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas," he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: "This is something that councils can choose to do already. "Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. "They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. "If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at." But Labour said the coalition's "failed" polices were "making the housing crisis worse not better". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: "Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods." He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and "put unemployed builders back to work" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. "Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. "That seems fairer to me," he added. The think tank also said the move would be "extremely popular" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be "cleansed" of "hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced "radical reforms" to "get Britain building" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme "set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure "social housing goes to those in greatest need", he added.	Councils should consider selling off their most expensive houses to build more cheap homes, the government says.
Brazil's Attorney-General, Rodrigo Janot, has asked the Supreme Court to open an investigation into Lula's alleged involvement in the multi-billion dollar scandal that has already seen dozens of lawmakers arrested. Here we look at the accusations in more detail and how the once popular ex-leader came to be linked to the allegations. At this stage, few details of the accusations against Lula are known as neither the Attorney-General's office nor the Supreme Court have made them public. What is certain is they are connected to Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a multi-billion dollar kickback scheme at state-oil company Petrobras. Investigators say that starting in 2003, construction companies formed a cartel to overcharge Petrobras for building contracts. They would then pay part of their windfall to Petrobras executives and politicians who were in on the deal. Prosecutors allege that the Workers' Party, of which both Lula and current President Dilma Rousseff are members, partly financed its campaigns and expenses through these kickbacks. Sao Paulo newspaper Folha quoted Attorney-General Janot as saying that the kickback scheme "could never have functioned for so many years and in such a broad and aggressive form under the federal government without the participation of ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva". Lula, who governed from 2003 to 2011, has denied the allegations. At this stage, we do not know what the evidence against Lula is. Local media have reported that the Attorney-General has sent several folders of documents to the Supreme Court. Nor is it known what the exact charges against Lula could be. Newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo reports that Mr Janot would charge Lula with obstruction of justice. The newspaper says that the former leader is suspected of hampering Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption at Petrobras. According to the daily, the Attorney-General will cite President Rousseff's nomination of Lula as her chief of staff as evidence that Lula and Ms Rousseff tried to obstruct justice. Under Brazilian law, members of the cabinet can only be investigated by the country's highest court. Lula was sworn in as chief of staff in March, but a judge suspended the nomination within an hour, arguing that it was a move to shield Lula from possible prosecution by the federal judge investigating the Petrobras scandal. The country's Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether Lula will be able to take up his post or not. The Attorney-General's move is based on testimony given by Senator Delcidio do Amaral as part of a plea bargain, according to Brazilian media. Mr Amaral of the governing Workers' Party was arrested in November on charges of obstructing justice, the first sitting senator to be arrested in Brazilian history. He is accused of trying to help former Petrobras executive Nestor Cervero flee the country. Cervero was jailed for being the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Amaral has been collaborating with the authorities. His testimony also prompted the Attorney-General to request the launch of an investigation into former presidential candidate Aecio Neves. Mr Neves lost to Ms Rousseff in the 2014 presidential race. Yes, police took the ex-president for questioning on 4 March. The officers escorting Lula to the police station were acting under a judge's order called a "conducao coercitiva" (bench warrant) which means that a person is commanded to appear before authorities to give testimony. Police also searched his house in Sao Bernardo, the offices of the Lula Institute - a non-governmental organisation founded by the ex-leader - and the homes of some of his family members and associates. In total, 200 police officers enforced 33 search and 11 arrest warrants at locations in three Brazilian states. While the allegations were related to the Petrobras kickbacks scheme, they focussed specifically on two properties allegedly owned by Lula's family. Prosecutors alleged that Lula had received "illicit benefits", such as having one of the construction firms involved in the Petrobras scandal renovate a luxury beachfront apartment and a ranch for his family. They said that "the suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS [construction firm] in the Petrobras graft scheme". Investigators said they also had evidence that in 2014 the ex-president received at least $270,000 (Â£190,000) worth of furniture and improvements for the beachfront apartment in Guaruja. They said they were also looking into sums paid to Lula by construction firms involved in the scandal as donations or speaking fees. Lula denied any wrongdoing. Lula was the political mentor of current President Dilma Rousseff and remains close to Ms Rousseff, who nominated him as her chief of staff in March. Ms Rousseff is currently facing impeachment proceedings over allegations she manipulated government accounts prior to her re-election in 2014. But up until now, she has not been linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal, even though some of her critics have questioned how she could not have been aware of such a wide-ranging kickback scheme while she held a senior position at the oil giant. Ms Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010. If her close friend and mentor Lula were to be charged, pressure on the president would increase massively at an already difficult time in her political career,	The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been accused of playing a key role in a huge corruption scandal involving state-oil company Petrobras.

Officers were called to Derby Road, Enfield at 15:30 GMT on Saturday after reports of a gun being seen in a car. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the reported car was stopped at 16:00 GMT and the four men inside were arrested. They are currently being held at a north London police station.

Jocelyn McKay is now 81 and said she feels "released" from the feelings that gripped her for so long. "I may be old, but at least I am happy," she told BBC News NI. "I hadn't really lived until I got the operation. "For years I felt I was in the wrong body and it wasn't until I was 69 that I plucked up the courage to ask for help." It was only after a trip to Manchester with some friends, during which Ms McKay lived as a woman, that she realised the surgery was something she needed. "I was a cross-dresser, I went away dressed as a man and I came home dressed as a man, but in between times I was a woman," she said. But cross-dressing was not good enough for her. When Ms McKay returned from her trip, she visited her GP, who referred her to a specialist. She said: "I had been going to the doctor for a range of ailments and he said to me: 'Thank God you've finally told me what's wrong.'" Every week three or four people present themselves as transgender to the Regional Gender Identity and Psychosexual Service at Knockbracken in Belfast. They typically make contact with the clinic through a GP referral or a drop-in facility every week. 200 people are currently being treated by the clinic with 50 more on the waiting list. More than half of them are aged between 18 and 25. The number of adults going to the clinic is doubling year on year. The clinic provides adults with assessment, psychological support and onward referral for hormone replacement therapy and surgery where appropriate. A gender identity panel to strategically look at the issues facing transgender people met for the first time at Stormont on Monday. It was formed by the peer support group Focus - The Identity Trust. It comprises politicians from Sinn FÃ©in and the Alliance party, as well as a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Lesley Carroll, and others with a long-standing interest in human rights. The Sinn FÃ©in minister Megan Fearon said the gathering was about "bringing marginalised people together, giving them space to discuss transgender issues and engaging with politicians in a way that had not been done before". "Transgender people still experience discrimination in nearly every walk of life," she said. The panel will address trans-phobic hate crime and access to health and education.	A pensioner who underwent gender re-assignment surgery at the age of 69 says she lived "in the wrong body" for most of her life because she feared the reaction of her friends and family.
A member of the public raised the alarm after seeing the woman, aged in her 50s, fall at Peveril Point, near Swanage, on Saturday afternoon. She was airlifted by the coastguard helicopter to King George's Field park where she was treated by paramedics. The injured woman, who is from the Swanage area, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. Ch Insp Bob Acaster, of Dorset Police, said: "Emergency services worked hard in very difficult weather to rescue the woman from the cliff and bring her to safety." Police said the woman's family had been informed.	A woman has suffered life-threatening injuries falling from cliffs on Dorset's Jurassic Coast.
The video, filmed by Smith and obtained by a newspaper, appears to show him laughing while retired gymnast Luke Carson mimics Islamic prayer practices. Smith, who won pommel horse silver at Rio 2016, later said he was "deeply sorry" for his "thoughtless actions". British Gymnastics said: "We will be investigating the behaviours reported." In a statement, the governing body added: "Members who break our code of conduct can face suspension or expulsion from our organisation." Smith, who has won medals at the past three Olympic Games, has already been censured twice this year by British Gymnastics. In April, the 27-year-old apologised for questioning the judging at the British Championships, where he was beaten to pommel gold by Max Whitlock. He was also reprimanded in June for posting an image on social media of an American gymnast, who was 16 when the photograph was taken, accompanied by a comment British Gymnastics said was "unbefitting to a participant". That reprimand was to remain on his record for two years with the added warning "any further misconduct may lead to even greater consequences". Smith is one of Britain's best-known gymnasts and won the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing in 2012. He is taking a break from the sport and is instead touring as a guest celebrity on the Keep Dancing stage production.	Four-time Olympic medallist Louis Smith may face "suspension or expulsion" by British Gymnastics over a video in which he apparently mocks Islam.
Rangers were knocked out of the Europa League qualifiers while Alves was on international duty with Portugal. The 35 year old has now started training with the club and has set his sights on winning trophies at Ibrox. "Even if we didn't play European games of course I would have joined this club," Alves said. "It was [frustrating] because I have expectations to play European games but it was not this year. "Maybe it is going to be next year. We need to be focused now." Alves signed a two-year deal at Rangers after leaving Serie A side Cagliari, but was late joining up with the squad in pre-season because he was playing in the Confederations Cup in Russia with Portugal, who finished third. Rangers defeated Progres Niederkorn 1-0 in the first-leg at Ibrox, but lost in Luxembourg 2-0 as manager Pedro Caixinha tries to blend in his summer signings - with nine players having joined the club this summer. Alves is the most experienced, and the former Porto, Zenit St Petersburg and Fenerbahce defender is focused on helping the Ibrox club to a successful season. "I already know how big is this club and for me I am proud to come here and join this team," he said. "Everybody has good expectations for the season and we are working very hard to achieve what we propose to do. "I can bring my experience and what I have learned in football. "I have won with almost all of the clubs I have played with and I hope to bring that again to this big club. "I am looking forward to putting the jersey on and playing and giving my best and also learn because football is continuous learning. It is going to be a good experience for myself."	Portuguese international Bruno Alves says playing European football was not a factor in his decision to move to Ibrox.
Denny Solomona crossed for Castleford, but Wigan led at half-time against the run of play through Lewis Tierney's try and Matty Smith's penalty kick. Grant Millington's try put the visitors back in front, before John Bateman went over to restore Wigan's two-point lead. Nick Gregson got his first senior try and Bateman crossed again late on as Warriors climbed to third in the table. Having suffered their heaviest defeat in Super League since 2005 with a 62-0 loss to Wakefield in their previous fixture, Wigan started slowly but were good value for their win after the break. The hosts failed to take advantage when Luke Gale was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with the scores level in the first half, but Bateman's return to the side after two games out sparked the comeback. Shaun Wane's team also welcomed back Dom Crosby, who made his first Super League appearance of the season having recovered from a hip injury. Solomona moved clear as Super League's leading try-scorer with his 13th of the season, but Tigers were frustrated by improved Wigan defence in the second period as they suffered their fourth defeat in a row at the DW Stadium. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I don't want to keep going on about it. But, if you knew what we had gone through this week, there's so much toughness showed in that game against a really good Cas team. "The admiration I have got for my players, the desire to grind out the win with the circumstances that nobody knows about is unbelievable. "There were quite a few good performances, they are a good team and are well coached who know how to defend. "We're not the biggest team, but I thought the way we defended was outstanding." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "That last try gave the score a bit of an easier look than it was. It was tight all the way through. "We lacked a little bit of quality in our play. I thought we defended awesome, they came at us in the second half with a game plan that put us under pressure. "They made minimal errors and kicked well and we couldn't find a spark to get us out of yardage and into good field position. "They deserved to win the game, they had more ball than us in decent field position and we had to work really hard to keep them out and that drained our energy reserves." Wigan: Sarginson; Tierney, Bateman, Gildart, Charnley; Gregson, Smith; Mossop, Powell, Clubb, Tomkins, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Crosby, Tautai, Burke, Bretherton. Castleford: Hampshire; Monaghan, Minikin, Webster, Solomona; Holmes, Gale; Lynch, Milner, Jewitt, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: McShane, Millington, Maher, Cook. Referee: Phil Bentham.	Wigan moved level on points with Super League leaders Warrington by coming from behind to beat Castleford.

Hodson started his career at Watford and played 51 games in three seasons at MK Dons after a loan at Brentford. He joins new faces Matt Gilks, Clint Hill, Joey Barton, Niko Kranjcar, Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh Windass at Ibrox.

Rangers have made right-back Lee Hodson their eighth summer signing on a three-year deal from MK Dons.
It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. "There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. "I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results." Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. "I am going to seek as broad a government as possible", he said. " I'm going to seek out many partners." That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. Israel and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.	When the giant TV screens at the Likud election headquarters finally flashed up the results of the national exit polls, one-by-one there was a sudden tidal wave of sound.
Creator Or Arbel told technology news site TechCrunch the app was having "security issues". The app allows users to send a message saying "yo" to friends - and nothing else. It has been branded "pointless", but has nonetheless raised $1m (Â£600,000) in investment. TechCrunch said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app. "We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back)," the students told TechCrunch. "We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user... We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that)." Other developers have been able to recreate the flaw. Similar problems have hit apps such as Snapchat and Tinder in the past few months. Mr Arbel told TechCrunch he was dealing with the issue, but would not elaborate further. "Some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on," he said, adding that he had hired a specialist security team. "We are taking this very seriously." Despite the app's apparent pointlessness, it has quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of users. Mr Arbel said more than four million "yo" messages had been sent. A service that sends a "yo" to a user every time a goal is scored in the World Cup has already been launched - with other similar services planned. The app, which took eight hours to create, has the technology community divided - with some seeing the app, and its seven-figure investment, as a sign of increasing hysteria in Silicon Valley for offbeat ideas. "We have decided this is an idea with great potential," Mr Arbel told the Financial Times. One reader of The Verge technology news site said the app, and its sudden mainstream coverage, was "accelerating the decline of civilisation".

The judge described the evidence against Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly as overwhelming. The action was taken by the victims' families, who have been awarded £1.6m damages. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the Real IRA attack on the County Tyrone town in August 1998. Delivering his summary, Mr Justice Gillen recognised the scale of the terrorist outrage for which no one has ever been convicted. "The barrier of time has not served to disguise the enormity of this crime, the wickedness of its perpetrators and the grief of those who must bear its consequences," he said. "Even 15 years on nothing can dilute the pulsing horror of what happened." Lord Brennan QC, who represented the families, said the bereaved relatives were determined that the damages would be paid. "Enforcement will be pursued with vigour here and in other relevant jurisdictions," he said. Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed in the bombing, described it as an "important judgement". "We will be pursuing the judgement because it would be a very hollow judgement if it was merely words," he said. "We will be doing our best to try and recover the damages but at the moment, we're just happy that we've got a judgement that we, the families, the victims, have held someone to account for what happened at Omagh." During the retrial it was claimed that Colm Murphy supplied mobile phones to the bomb team. Mr Justice Gillen said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that two phones linked to Colm Murphy were used in the attack, with anyone who knowingly provided them to the bomb team liable. The builder's denials about lending his phone to anyone and subsequent explanation to police in the Irish Republic were wholly implausible and amounted to lies with no innocent explanation, according to the judge. The coincidence of a similar unexplained use by the same phone in an earlier bombing in Banbridge was found to amount to further probative evidence of Murphy's involvement in the Omagh operation. "To suggest that for a second time his phone had been mysteriously used without his knowledge moves one into the realm of fantasy," Mr Justice Gillen said. He described Mr Murphy's explanation for failing to give evidence as being due to his lack of confidence in the judicial system as "bordering on the risible". "It makes the prima facie case even stronger and renders it now overwhelming," he added. The same verdict was returned against Seamus Daly, based on his conversation on one of the bomb-run phones less than an hour after the explosion. Mr Daly's guilty plea and conviction for Real IRA membership in November 2000 was also taken into account. "This was relevant not just to propensity but was logically probative in determining the issue of liability in this case," Mr Justice Gillen said. Neither man was at the High Court in Belfast to hear the 73-page judgement. "I have determined that both defendants were involved in assisting the preparation, planting and detonation of the bomb," Mr Justice Gillen said. Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann in the atrocity, said he hoped the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in the Republic would now review the evidence following the verdict. "Out of all this, what we have heard from the judge, I think the Gardai, PSNI, and the bodies that be, have to really look at all this information and all this evidence and see if there is a case that these people have to answer for," he said. Mr Gallagher said the Omagh families would be seeking an "early meeting" with the PSNI chief constable, Matt Baggott. "We believe it's important that he looks at the judgement that was delivered, that there could be the possibility of pursuing the individuals that we have held to account in a criminal court," he said. "We just cannot accept that 31 people can be murdered and no-one can be brought to justice for that crime." Following the verdict, Lord Brennan QC, said he wanted the nine-year-long legal battle brought to an end. Opposing a stay on the judgment pending any further challenge, the barrister described the verdict against Mr Murphy and Mr Daly as "damning". "The prospects on appeal are, in our submission, zero," he said. "The defendants have had their full measure of legal aid and the ability to participate in this trial. Let it come to an end." The barrister also confirmed plans to pursue all four men now held liable for the bombing. To date, no-one has been successfully criminally prosecuted for the bombing. In the absence of criminal convictions, the victims' families took a landmark civil action, seeking damages from the men they believed were responsible. The retrial followed the original Omagh bomb civil case, which is believed to be the first time anywhere in the world that alleged members of a terrorist organisation have been sued. The first trial concluded in June 2009, when a judge ruled that four men - Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly - were all responsible for carrying out the atrocity. The 12 relatives who had taken the action were awarded more than £1.6m in damages. Mr McCombe said the families had not received "one single penny" from that judgement. However, the four men who were found liable subsequently launched appeals. Michael McKevitt and Liam Campbell failed to have the civil judgement against them overturned two years later. Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were successful in upholding their appeals in July 2011, but the pair were then ordered to face a retrial of the civil case. Mr Murphy a Dundalk-based publican and contractor, and former employee Seamus Daly, from Cullaville, County Monaghan, denied playing central roles in the atrocity.	Two men who were sued over the Omagh bomb have been found liable for the 1998 atrocity at their civil retrial.
"In full co-ordination with the government of Iraq, we're deploying a specialised expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces," Mr Carter said. The operators would carry out raids, free hostages and capture IS leaders. They would also conduct "unilateral operations" in Syria, he said. Islamic State conquered large swathes of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014. A US-led coalition of 65 countries is conducting a campaign against the militants in both countries. Mr Carter made the announcement in remarks to the House Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday. He did not offer specifics on troop numbers, but said they would also be focused on securing Iraq's borders and building the capacity of the Iraqi government forces. US special forces have already conducted operations in both Syria and Iraq - notably the killing of the IS oil chief Abu Sayaff in eastern Syria and the freeing of prisoners from the IS-held town of Hawija near Kirkuk in Iraq. But this is a clear indication from the Pentagon that their role will become more significant. The "specialised expeditionary targeting force", as the Iraq group is being called, will not only assist local forces but will also conduct further "unilateral" raids into Syria. While this does not amount to significant numbers of boots on the ground, it is an escalation of America's role in direct combat. Mr Carter said there was now an important opportunity to divide IS militants in Iraq from those in Syria. In October, the US announced it would send up to 50 special forces soldiers to northern Syria as military advisers to Kurdish and rebel forces.	The US is to deploy a specialised force to Iraq to build pressure on Islamic State militants, US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter has said.
The council is consulting on plans to introduce a cycle lane on Pontcanna's Cathedral Road, make some streets one-way and removing a traffic island. It comes as part of the 2015-16 local transport plan, which proposes new cycle lanes across the city, 20mph speed restrictions, crossings and park and ride improvements. The council aims for 50% of trips to be made by sustainable modes by 2026. The Cathedral Road project is part of a wider north west Cardiff bus corridor scheme, to improve journey time and reliability so more people are encouraged to use buses. The council estimates Cardiff's population will increase by nearly a quarter over 25 years, resulting in a 32% increase in traffic and 20% increase in commuters. The plans include measures to re-allocate space on the roads to cyclists and remove on-street parking on the approach to junctions. There are also plans to add bus lanes and improve signage.	Major overhauls to transport routes in Cardiff are being considered.
Officers are searching 18 premises in London and one in Stoke-on-Trent. The Met Police said it was part of an ongoing inquiry into Islamist-related terrorism and not in response to any immediate threat to the public. Mr Choudary is the former UK head of the Islamist group al-Muhajiroun or Islam4UK, banned in the UK in 2010. The arrested men, aged between 22 and 51, are being held at police stations in central London. by Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs correspondent Anjem Choudary is a deeply controversial Islamic figure, a man who many Muslims despise because they believe he causes enormous damage to their position in British society. Alongside another now-banned cleric, he once spearheaded al-Muhajiroun, a group that argued that the West is fighting a war against Muslims and Islam. When the government banned the group, some of its former members founded new organisations, including Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades - which were also later banned. The latter group's protests against British soldiers returning from Afghanistan, led to counter-protests and the subsequent formation of the English Defence League. Mr Choudary has always denied allegations that he has either incited or glorified acts of terrorism. In a statement the Met said the men were being held on suspicion of being members of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation contrary to Section 11 and 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and encouraging terrorism, contrary to Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006. Police said a number of residential, business and community premises are being searched; 11 in east London, one in west London, one in north-west London and five in south London. A residential property is also being searched in Stoke-on-Trent. The arrests were carried out by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command (SO15).	Nine men, including the radical Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary, have been arrested in London on suspicion of being members of a banned organisation.
Vale took a deserved lead when AJ Leitch-Smith converted Byron Moore's cross. Jamal Campbell-Ryce equalised just after half-time with a drilled finish and Sam Hird headed the hosts in front. JJ Hooper's curling shot brought the visitors level, but Gboly Ariyibi turned in a corner and O'Shea's 20-yard shot sealed the win. The win moved the Spireites up to 17th, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Port Vale dropped to 13th, 10 points adrift of the play-off places.	Chesterfield boosted their hopes of staying up with a comeback win to dent Port Vale's slender play-off hopes.
Peers defied the government by backing calls to set up a joint parliamentary committee to look at the proposals. Lord Lawson and Lord Forsyth were among Conservative peers to rebel as the government lost by 320 votes to 139. Ministers have had to redraft plans to give English MPs an effective veto on laws deemed to apply to England only and to delay a vote amid opposition. The Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to give English MPs a decisive say over legislation exclusively affecting England but have run into trouble over the details of the plan and how it will be introduced. The plan is for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs at third reading. Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved. A similar process would be used, including Welsh MPs, where matters covered only England and Wales. But the SNP has said they will be excluded them from votes on matters affecting Scotland and create two classes of MP in the Commons while Labour has said the proposals are being rushed and need more detailed scrutiny. Peers have now backed calls by Lord Butler, the former cabinet secretary and crossbench peer, for a special committee of MPs and peers to look into the proposals in depth. Lord Butler said he backed the principle of requiring laws affecting England to have the consent of a majority of English MPs but there were better ways of approaching what has long been known as the "West Lothian question" "Surely it is more important to get the proposals right than to rush them through," he said. The vote does not bind the government unless the House of Commons also agrees to such a move. The Leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell, maintained that peers would get a debate on the plans in the autumn, but after 30 years of trying to find a solution to the problem of English-only laws it was time to take action. "There does come a point where we need to stop talking and get on with taking some action," she said.	The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over plans for so-called "English votes for English laws".
All 26 are accused of evading tests but say there was an administrative error. The list includes Fabrizio Donato, triple jump bronze medallist at London 2012, and Andrew Howe, who took silver in the long jump at the 2007 World Championships. They will face trials at the Italian Olympic Committee's anti-doping court, with rulings expected next year. Five of the 26 athletes have already qualified for next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	Italy's Olympic chiefs want 26 of the country's athletes banned for two years over alleged doping offences.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says the full evacuation of civilians and rebels is likely to take several days. Government forces, backed by Russian allies, took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week. It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad. He hailed the "liberation" of Aleppo and said history was being made. Global solidarity over Aleppo How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo What's happening in Aleppo? What happens next? The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed. "Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out," the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left. "No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days," she added. The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province. US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out "nothing short of a massacre" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva. "The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people," he said in Washington. John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks. But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. "You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate," he told me. Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith. Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - "delusional diplomacy", the Washington Post called it. Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one. Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city. A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo. The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed. As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured. The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances. Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal. The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: "A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants." "This corridor is 21km long," he said, adding, "6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups." Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. In a televised address, he said Turkey would take "children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions". The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred. UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer. "If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo," he told reporters in Paris. The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members. Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages. Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years. In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be "the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters. He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front. Idlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer. It also borders the coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect.	More than 3,000 people have been evacuated in buses and ambulances from a besieged rebel-held enclave in the Syrian city of Aleppo, officials say.

It was one of several measures European and African leaders agreed to reduce the flow of people into Europe. The leaders said their aim was to "address the root causes of migration". The Europe-Africa meeting was planned after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank off Libya in April. Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was "not enough for the whole of Africa". Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it "more generously financed". Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that "reform of global governance" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC:  "What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment." EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed "a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016". These include setting up a joint European and African team in Niger to tackle people smuggling and increasing the number of visas available to students and researchers. "We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives," Mr Tusk said. The European trust fund is supposed to "foster stability... and to contribute to better migration management", according to a European Union statement. It is also aimed at "promoting economic... opportunities, security and development" in the 23 African countries named which, along with Senegal, include Nigeria, Eritrea and Libya. The money will be spent on: "Financial aid to accept deportation of thousands" declares Algerian daily El-Khabar, before quoting human rights groups warning that Europe was "forcing African countries to play the role of policeman". However, Germany's tabloid Bild asks: "Why is Chancellor Merkel negotiating with Africa's despots?" in its account of the "tricky Valletta summit". Similarly, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money for fewer refugees from Africa was making critics "accuse the EU of showing its real values by cooperating with unjust regimes". In neighbouring France, Le Figaro urges President Francois Hollande to "have the courage" to drastically cut all kinds of aid for migrants. "In the short term, what is he waiting for to close the Calais 'jungle'... and change the policy against clandestine immigration?" In Russia, state-controlled Channel One TV describes the summit as "another attempt by Europe to stop the chaos", noting that "whilst Europe and Africa are bargaining with each other, thousands are embarking on fatal trips in the Mediterranean". The $1.9bn fund is in addition to the $20bn the EU already spends on development assistance in Africa every year, Mr Tusk said. The fund is also supposed to be boosted by contributions by individual member states, but only a small amount had been pledged. The UN says some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. But this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. There have been more than 3,000 deaths as people try to make the crossing. BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin says the crisis has evolved so quickly this year that European leaders have been struggling to keep up and formulate any coherent policies.	The $1.9bn (£1.2bn) European fund to tackle African migration is not sufficient, several African leaders have said after crisis talks with their European counterparts.
I feel like I'm playing well right now and can't wait for the second week. I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I thought I'd use this column to answer some of the questions you sent using Twitter and Facebook. Q) What did Seppi say to you to make you laugh at the end? (John Parsons) I didn't really hear exactly what he said, but he said it and then laughed, so I laughed as well. Q) Does Ivo Karlovic have the best serve and how do you prepare for facing it? (Alan Bingle) He has one of the best for sure. It's difficult to pick who has the best. To prepare for it I usually have my coach or whoever it is I'm hitting with stand just behind the service line and basically just serve from there and try to react. I ask them to try and ace me for 10 minutes so I get used to seeing the ball go past me, and also reacting to a serve coming at me from that height. Media playback is not supported on this device Q) What do you think about Wimbledon's dress code? (Danyal Khan) It is very strict but I do like that it's all white because it's different. We don't have that the rest of the year and that is one of the things that makes Wimbledon unique. Q) Should the rules of tennis be changed since toilet breaks & medical time-outs are being increasingly used to break up sporting momentum, and the integrity of the sport? (James Walker) Yes, they should be. Why not? They could get rid of the medical time-outs, for sure. You can't get rid of toilet breaks but you could have them at the end of the set. Normally the toilets are right by the side of the court. Maybe on the outside courts it's not the case but normally they are right there and there's no reason for a toilet break to last 10 minutes. But sometimes we play for four or five hours and you're drinking so many fluids, you can't get rid of them altogether - what if someone needs to go? You don't want to see what might happen on the court! Q) What is your pet preference after dogs? (Alexander Broadbean) That's a good question. We talked about having a cat before but none of my family ever had cats while I was growing up. I think with what I do for a living, having cats is actually not a bad thing because they don't need as much attention as dogs. I had a hamster when I was a kid, called Whisky. He escaped down the floorboards never to be seen again and I was absolutely devastated. Q) Who would win a fastest sausage-eater contest between your dogs Maggie May and Rusty? (Amanda C) Rusty's a quicker eater. He's just bigger. He's a boy and wolfs his food down. Q) Would you ever consider Grand Slam doubles? (Jake) I would like to. I couldn't at Wimbledon because the doubles is best-of-five sets. You look at some of the matches, you can be out there for three-and-a-half or four hours. There's no way physically I would be able to do that here. But I would like to play because I love the Grand Slams and doing well in the doubles is good. I respect the doubles players, my brother's one, and often doubles matches can be very exciting, especially in the latter stages of Grand Slams. It is a part of our game that a lot of club players play and I think it should be shown more on the TV. Q) Where did you watch Heather Watson's match against Serena Williams and were you on your feet shouting? (Rachel Grace) Media playback is not supported on this device I watched it at home. I watched the first set and the beginning of the second, and then I snoozed for 20 minutes and woke up at 5-4 in the second set. Then I watched the whole of the end of the match. I don't really jump up and scream when I'm watching because of the dogs - Kim was doing that and the dogs were going crazy. I normally go very quiet and quite insular when I'm watching matches that I'm into. With boxing I do that as well - individual sports. With team sports it's different, but with individual sports and when I care about the outcome, I tend to not say a whole lot. Q) Who would play you in a movie and why? (Sandy) Andrew Garfield - I've been told we look alike. Q) Who was your sporting hero growing up? (Greg) Andre Agassi. I loved watching him when I was a kid. He had a great personality - very charismatic, very different. Q) Do you prefer scrambled eggs or fried? (Josh) Scrambled. I've just got into cooking them on my own and I do them pretty well. I learned from watching Gordon Ramsay on the internet. Andy Murray was speaking to BBC Sport's Piers Newbery. You can follow Murray on Twitter,Facebook and Instagram.	Saturday's match against Andreas Seppi was a tough one but I got through it, and the crowd on Centre Court really made a difference.
The lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco argues that the policy is unconstitutional. Women can serve in front line positions in the US military, but they are barred from ground combat units. A Pentagon spokesman said 14,500 combat positions had been opened to women under the current defence secretary. He added that Defence Secretary Leon Panetta had "directed the services to explore the possibility of opening additional roles for women in the military". But ACLU lawyer Ariela Migdal said the changes so far were "not enough". The lawsuit argues that continuing restrictions violate servicewomen's constitutional rights to equality. One of the plaintiffs, Marine Corps Capt Zoe Bedell, said existing rules had blocked her advancement in the Marines. "The military is the last place where you are allowed to be discriminated against because of your gender," she said. Women account for about 14% of the 1.4 million active US military personnel. The lawsuit launched on Tuesday says they are barred from 238,000 positions, but also alleges that they are already serving unofficially in combat units.	The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a challenge on behalf of four US servicewomen against a ban on women being deployed in most combat roles.
It proposes the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank should be improved and extended via Hawick to Carlisle. The report, produced by the Campaign for Borders Rail (CBR), said that could provide a "new strategic link" in the national network. Extending the line is already being examined as part of a wider study of transport issues in southern Scotland. "We believe that the Borders needs a through route to the south to maximise the region's economic potential," the CBR report states. "For Hawick, a rail link is vital." The Summary Case for a New Cross-Border Rail Link adds: "CBR is committed to making the case for further rail-led economic and social regeneration of the Borders and a transformative new cross-border rail link." Now it is time for Hawick and other communities in the southern Borders to benefit directly. The briefing sees the vision for an extended Borders Railway as an "exciting opportunity". "This document will help inform the debate on preparing for the proposed railway through the Scottish Borders to Carlisle and beyond," said Allan McLean, chairman of the CBR. "The economies of Edinburgh, Midlothian and the northern Borders have all gained demonstrably from the opening of the Borders Railway. "Now it is time for Hawick and other communities in the southern Borders to benefit directly." The briefing document sets out the CBR's commercial, social and economic cases for a new railway linking the existing Tweedbank terminus to the West Coast Main Line at Mossband, just north of Carlisle. "The completed railway would allow through trains between Edinburgh and Carlisle, serving intermediate settlements including Hawick," the report states. "Communities not directly served would benefit from access by connecting bus services and park and ride stations." The report claimed that extending the railway was the "only realistic proposal" to adequately address economic and social problems faced by the Scottish Borders and release the route's full potential. It said detailed studies indicated benefits for passengers and freight that could be realised by the investment. The report has been presented to Transport Minister Humza Yousaf. Earlier this year it was announced a new study would look at the possibility of extending the Borders Railway. The findings will feed into the Scottish government's nationwide strategic transport projects review.	A new report has been published detailing the advantages of enhancing and extending the Borders Railway.
Starting the day on 90-4, Australia reached 156-6 before declaring for the second time in the match. England were quickly reduced to 29-5, with Sarah Taylor out for a second consecutive duck. Lydia Greenway and Georgia Elwiss stemmed the tide before England lost their last five wickets in 39 balls. Australia seamer Ellyse Perry took career-best figures of six wickets for 32 runs, including removing Greenway and Laura Marsh with consecutive balls, as England collapsed from 80-6 to 101 all out. It means Australia are now up 8-2 on points in the seven-match series, with three Twenty20 matches remaining that are each worth two points to the winner. Ashes holders England can no longer win the series, but they could secure an unlikely draw by winning all three T20s. Media playback is not supported on this device With the 263 runs required for victory an unlikely target, England's main task was to survive 89 overs. In a repeat of the first innings, Sarah Coyte trapped Heather Knight lbw to bring Taylor, arguably England's best batter, to the crease. Taylor, looking for vital runs after struggling with the bat during the series, survived only five balls as she played a delivery from Perry on to her stumps for a second duck in the Test. Scraping through to lunch on 16-2, Charlotte Edwards was caught behind off the first ball after the break from Perry to start a collapse to 29-5. Megan Schutt dismissed Lauren Winfield and Natalie Sciver cheaply before Greenway and Elwiss dropped anchor. Greenway defended stoutly, with 128 dot balls from the 137 deliveries she faced, before a devastating spell from Perry sent England tumbling to defeat. Australia's Jess Jonassen was the only player to pass 50 in the match, her effort seeming even more impressive given England's struggles on the same pitch. Edwards' side were incapable of coping with the brilliance of Perry, who took Greenway's wicket in bizarre fashion as the English player attempted to duck out of the way of a short ball only for it to stay low and clip her leg stump. The wicket was part of a majestic spell that saw all-rounder Perry take four wickets in 20 balls for just eight runs. England's meek demise against arch rivals Australia left much to be desired - as they lost their second consecutive Test since becoming a fully professional side. And ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent believes the hosts lacked the resilience in their batting to ever have had a realistic chance of drawing the match. "The manner in which England rolled over today, in particular with the batting, hasn't shown enough fight," she said. "They are going to feel the pain of this because the way they have approached the match just hasn't been good enough. "Australia adapted to the match situation much quicker and their captaincy was much more dynamic, aggressive and inventive - whereas England looked like it was a pre-planned process. "I think the players need to find some guts and fight for the country and to turn themselves around in a week mentally is going to be a tough challenge." England captain Charlotte Edwards: "It's really disappointing. I thought at tea time we had a sniff of holding on. We simply weren't good enough over the four days. "We're not delivering as a batting unit. There's poor shot selection, but it's not through lack of trying. We're not learning quickly enough. "It's down to the players, not the coaches. There are world-class players not delivering. "We're going to fight to the bitter end. A change of format might be able to help us express ourselves." Australia captain Meg Lanning: "This Test match was massive for us. We knew it would put us in the box seat. "Winning the Ashes is the one thing that we haven't been able to do in the last five years. We came here really confident. "England are a class side and they've got players there who can win games. We'll have to play well to win the T20s. "Jess Jonassen was batting on a different deck to the rest of us, so she was certainly a big difference in this game. She's one to watch."	England need to win all three remaining games of the series to retain the Women's Ashes after Australia clinched the Test by 161 runs.
1 April 2017 Last updated at 12:33 BST The tiny pad was appraised by manuscripts specialist Matthew Haley during an episode filmed at Caversham Park in Berkshire. The programme will air on Sunday at 20:00 BST on BBC One.	A 17th Century notebook analysing the work of William Shakespeare has been described as "extraordinary" by an Antiques Roadshow expert.
It is the second time the hooker has skippered the Lions during the tour, having led them to a win over the Chiefs. Coach Warren Gatland made the decision after the Lions lost the opening Test against New Zealand 30-15 on Saturday. The second Test against the All Blacks is on Saturday, 1 July. "We are obviously hugely disappointed with the result but it is important to regroup," said Gatland. "We know there are a lot of players motivated to go out and get a result for the whole group. "A few players put their hands up for selection from the Chiefs game and played their way into the Test team so they know that there is another opportunity for them on Tuesday against the Super Rugby champions."

Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security alert across the country. Police said Melhem, 29, was the gunman who killed two Israelis at a bar, then the Israeli Arab driver of a taxi who picked him up after the attack. Security camera footage showed a suspect taking an automatic rifle out of his backpack and then firing at least 15 shots at people in the street before fleeing the scene. Alon Bakal, 26, who was a manager at the bar, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, were killed. Taxi driver Amin Shaban died after being found critically injured in the north of the city shortly after the shootings. Melhem's father, Mohammed, identified his son as the suspect and reported him to the police. Mohammed Melhem and several relatives have been arrested in connection with the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated security forces, who he said had "worked tirelessly, methodically and professionally to locate and eliminate the terrorist". Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Melhem was shot dead after opening fire. A witness, Hakim Younis, told Israel's Channel 10 TV he saw a fierce gun battle, the Associated Press news agency reported "I was sitting on my balcony with my cousin... when suddenly shooting began, hundreds of bullets, like in a war," he said. Police have not yet established a motive for the Tel Aviv killings. Israel was already on high alert amid a wave of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs which have killed 22 Israelis since the beginning of October. During that time 149 Palestinians - more than half said by Israel to be attackers - have been shot dead by security forces or their victims. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces. One Israeli Arab was also shot dead after carrying out an attack at a bus station in southern Israel in October in which an Israeli soldier was killed.	An Israeli Arab wanted for shooting dead three people in Tel Aviv on 1 January has been killed by security forces in northern Israel.
Defender Terry, 36, is leaving Chelsea this summer after more than two decades at Stamford Bridge. Swansea, West Brom and Bournemouth have been linked with the former England captain, while a move to China or the United States appear other options. "I've got options but nothing sorted or in stone," said Terry. Media playback is not supported on this device "Everyone keeps asking me and no-one believes me when I say that I've not got anything sorted." Terry was an unused substitute in Saturday's 2-1 FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal at Wembley. He has made 717 appearances for Chelsea and is a five-time Premier League title winner with the London club. He has also won the Champions League and Europa League, as well as five FA Cups and three League Cups. Although he has yet to make up his mind whether to retire, Terry is keen to become a manager once he does decide to stop playing. "I think I've got too much to give and I've learned too much not to pass that on," he added. "I do want to be a manager."	John Terry says he has not made up his mind whether to retire from playing and "needs a good week away to reflect" before making a decision.
The former Liverpool, Swansea City, Reading and Watford boss has signed a 12-month rolling contract to replace Ronny Deila, who departed the Scottish champions at the end of the season. Rodgers, 43, left Anfield in October after more than three years in charge. "I will give everything I have and do all I can to bring our supporters exciting, entertaining and winning football," said the Northern Irishman. Rodgers can give Celtic hope - Sutton "The club has been in magnificent shape in recent years and has collected silverware regularly during this time. "My objective now, of course, is to continue this work, to keep us at the top and again make our mark in Europe." Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Celtic's largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond described Rodgers as "a great manager", adding that the Scottish Premiership club had interviewed "in excess of six" candidates, It also emerged that Rodgers met club representatives for several hours on Wednesday. "Brendan is a highly-sought after manager and we are pleased we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic," said chief executive Peter Lawwell. "I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. "We wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters - we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. "We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic." Media playback is not supported on this device Rodgers moved into management with Watford and subsequently had a spell in charge of Reading before leading Swansea City to promotion to the Premier League. A switch to Liverpool followed and Rodgers came close to the title in 2013-2014, finishing two points behind Manchester City. However, he left Anfield without winning a trophy. Rodgers will come up against Rangers manager Mark Warburton next season, with the two men having worked together on the coaching staff at Watford. "He's very experienced, well organised, a good motivator, a good man-manager," Warburton said this week. "He's a manager of the highest quality." John Hartson, a former Celtic striker is also a fan of Rodgers and believes his appointment will be warmly greeted by the Celtic supporters. "I think they've got themselves a proper manager of the highest regard," the former Wales international said. "I think he'll do very, very well. It's a great opportunity for Brendan and I think the fans will embrace his appointment. " 'Rodgers has to not pretend to reinvent football as he did at Liverpool' Former Celtic manager John Barnes is not surprised that the club have managed to lure Rodgers. "He will not view it as a step down, despite what others will think," he said. "Celtic is a huge club. They are in the Champions League and I'm sure Brendan would want to pit his wits against the big sides there. "The fans can expect a very exciting brand of football. In terms of playing the Celtic way, they couldn't pick a better man for the job." BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson "For Celtic, the most comparable spell has been Rodgers' time at Swansea - an aspirational club, with a well-defined budget, and a sense of momentum. "The Northern Irishman embraced the club's past, but also redefined its horizons, taking them into the Premier League and then to 11th place. "He signed shrewdly, seeking talented players who had not been coveted by larger clubs or were not yet ready for that stage, and moulding them into a side that played attractive, engaging and artful football." 'Rodgers' Swansea model can be a success at Celtic'	Celtic have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager.
Many wept as they prayed for the pope outside the city's main cathedral. The vigil was followed by a Sunday morning Mass, with the dead pope's body sat in the papal chair dressed in ceremonial robes. He died at the age of 88 on Saturday, after reportedly suffering from cancer. He led the Church for four decades. Coptic Christians make up 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million, making them the Middle East's largest Christian minority. After attacks on Coptic Christians in recent years, Pope Shenouda had urged officials to do more to address the community's concerns. A crowd of mourners estimated to be larger than 100,000, spent the night outside St Mark's Cathedral, many weeping as they prayed for the pope. Thousands queued to see Pope Shenouda, whose body was placed in a coffin before being seated on a ceremonial throne wearing embroidered vestments and a golden mitre, and holding a gold-topped staff. The government has given Coptic Christians three days off work to prepare for his funeral. The BBC's Jon Leyne, in Cairo, says there is no timetable yet for the selection of his successor, who will be elected by a conclave of senior bishops. Tributes have come in from around the world, with Roman Catholic Pope Benedict XVI offering prayers and US President Barack Obama praising Pope Shenouda as an "advocate for tolerance and religious dialogue". Egypt's military rulers expressed the hope on their Facebook page that his wish of "preserving the unity of Egypt and the unity of its social fabric" would be achieved. And a senior Muslim cleric, the Grand Imam of the prestigious al-Azhar university, Ahmed al-Tayeb, expressed sorrow and said he "greatly remembers his vision towards Jerusalem and its history". Pope Shenouda had returned recently to Egypt after seeking treatment abroad. Our correspondent says he sought to protect his Christian community's position within the Muslim majority by striking a conservative tone and lending tacit support to President Mubarak's rule. Whoever succeeds him now faces the task of reassuring the Coptic community as the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood look on the verge of sharing power in Egypt for the first time, our correspondent says.	Tens of thousands of Egyptian Coptic Christians have held an overnight vigil in Cairo to mourn the death of their spiritual leader, Pope Shenouda III.
Lara Clarke, from Brownhills, has previously made near-life-sized cakes of Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lawrence. Her latest creation, baked to celebrate the Defender model, fed 2,000 people at an event at the factory in Solihull on Monday. The half-scale replica weighed 600kg and featured working headlights. Comprising 32 sponge cakes, 50kg (110 lbs) of butter cream, 20kg (44 lbs) of ganache and 50kg icing, it took her 150 hours to produce. Ms Clarke said the bake was so heavy it had to be delivered by fork lift truck. "We arrived by van and everyone was coming round to have a look," she said. "They couldn't believe it was a cake. There was plenty to go round and everyone on the factory floor got a piece." It was baked to celebrate the two millionth Defender rolling off the production line - the figure includes its predecessors the Series I, II and III models. Ms Clarke said it started after she tagged JLR in a tweet about a small Land Rover birthday cake. "They got in touch and asked if I could make a cake in the shape of an engine to mark the opening of their new engine plant. "A woman then asked me if I could make a Land Rover cake. "It was originally meant to be quite small, but I asked them if they wanted something that would really impress people." Ms Clarke said she was getting married in October, a week before the Cake International competition at Birmingham's NEC. Rather than enter this year, she said she planned to bake "the best wedding cake that's ever been seen".	A giant cake has been made in the shape of a Land Rover by an award-winning amateur baker from the West Midlands.
The warning has been made by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in its weekly update of A&E performance. It showed nine in 10 hospitals are increasing bed numbers - but despite this they have problems seeing patients quickly enough and discharging them. The RCEM weekly report provides a snapshot of performance. It covers more than 40 hospital trusts - one in five of the total. Special report page: For the latest news, analysis and video Nick Triggle: The lost beds problem Hugh Pym: The Northern Ireland challenge Winter across the UK:  A guide to how the NHS is coping Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt The update suggested that just over 86% of patients were seen and dealt with in four hours - below the 95% target. It also highlighted problems with delayed discharges - this is when hospitals cannot release patients because services or care are not available in the community. It said in some places a fifth of beds were being taken up by these patients. And it concluded that despite the best efforts of hospitals, winter was proving difficult and there was "insufficient capacity and capability" to respond to rising demand. Meanwhile, official data from NHS England, which also covers last week but does not include how hospitals are performing against the four-hour target, revealed visits to A&E were increasing. There were nearly 340,000 attendances last week, up from just under 328,000 the week before. But Dr Barbara Hakin, of NHS England, said despite the increasing pressures staff continued to "deliver a first-class service". "We are working hard to make sure all parts of the NHS are well prepared for the busy winter period," she added. Scotland is also providing weekly figures for its major A&E departments. It showed that up to the start of December just over 95% of patients were being seen in four hours. The latest data available in Wales covers October and in Northern Ireland, November. Both nations are missing the four-hour A&E target.

Just over 46,000 vehicles were registered north of the border - a year-on-year increase of more than 2.7%. However, UK sales increased by 5.3% to almost 519,000 - the strongest month recorded since 1999. March is typically the biggest month, accounting for about a fifth of the year's car registrations. Last month saw Vauxhall retain its position as market leader in Scotland, with more than 10,000 units sold. The Vauxhall Corsa remained the most popular new car, while the Ford Fiesta had a strong month and moved into the number two spot for the year to date. The figures were compiled by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Top Scottish sellers in March 1. Vauxhall Corsa 2,575 2. Ford Fiesta  1,772 3. Vauxhall Astra 1,249 4. Ford Focus 1,126 5. Volkswagen Polo 1,077 Source: SMMT Scottish Motor Trade Association chief executive Sandy Burgess said: "All areas have experienced growth with the exception of Dumfries and Galloway and Strathclyde. "The reductions however are minimal and with the fantastic growth on 2015 numbers elsewhere, we have come out of this critical sales period well ahead for the year to date. "We have been aware of some dealers who were experiencing new vehicle delivery issues towards the end of the month, and this may well have had a small but noticeable negative effect. "The rest of the UK continues to show stronger growth but as we have mentioned previously this may not all be down to sales with specific manufacturers and dealers taking tactical decisions on registrations."	New car sales in Scotland grew last month but at half the rate of the UK as a whole, according to motor traders.
Until mid-July, her main worry was getting the right grades for medical school. Now Chilla and her fellow pupils are faced with Turkish accusations that their school has links to a terrorist organisation. Kharisma Bangsa school is one of hundreds across the world that Turkey wants to shut down because they have links to a US-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The cleric is held responsible by the Ankara government for the failed July coup in which more than 270 people died. And Turkey argues the schools are part of a strategy to undermine the state. But pupils, teachers and parents interviewed in several countries say they have no links to suspicious activities. Turkey looks to close Gulen schools Who are the Gulenists? Who is Fethullah Gulen? Turkey coup: Who was behind Turkey coup attempt? Kharisma Bangsa is one of nine Indonesian schools Ankara says should be shut down because of their alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen. Turkey says the schools are part of a vast and secretive network which the Gulen movement has used to build a powerbase and infiltrate state institutions. Accusations have been levelled against schools with Turkish connections in more than a dozen countries, from Germany to Afghanistan, leaving thousands of children facing uncertainty over their education. Supporters of the schools say they are no more than a loose affiliation of institutions that share common values and are committed to academic excellence. From extensive interviews with BBC World Service across 10 countries in three continents, it is clear that the schools have much in common but operate quite differently. But all are feeling the pressure. There is no common brand name for the schools. In Pakistan they are called "Pak-Turk Lycees", in Kyrgyzstan they are known as "Sebat" (Persistence) schools, and in Kenya, "Light Academies". Most were set up as partnerships between Turkish and local businesses and organisations, but in many countries like Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan, the Turkish partners are no longer directly involved. Local and Turkish partners say they're admirers of Fethullah Gulen, but not connected to him formally. "A Gulen school, business or newspaper is generally unofficially labelled as such, because the owner or manager considers Fethullah Gulen as a spiritual leader or source of inspiration," says Turkish academic Bayram Balci. Alp Aslandogan, who speaks on behalf of Gulen-associated schools in the United States, says there are numerous social networks within the movement. "The schools which are seen as affiliated with the movement were started by people who belong to these networks." Followers of Fethullah Gulen often refer to their movement by the name Hizmet (service), and the schools all share the same ethics. "The teachers put emphasis on character-building, morals, and discipline," says Rosi, the mother of a pupil at Kharisma Bangsa. There's also a strong focus on teaching science. From Nairobi to Kandahar, school websites show pupils in smart uniforms, studying in well-equipped science labs or computer rooms. "The children study every day until 3pm, then they have additional classes, activity clubs, and homework," says Baktigul, whose daughter attends a Turkish school in Kyrgyzstan. "At 9pm they all sit down to have tea, and at 10pm it's bedtime." For Maxim Urazaev, who graduated from a Turkish lycee in the Russian city of Kazan in 2009 the experience was "tougher than being in the army". Head teachers have told the BBC the schools are not part of a formal structure. The head of Kyrgyzstan's 21 Sebat schools, Nurlan Kudaberdiev, says they are all connected to Fethullah Gulen informally because the schools were his idea. "But there's no direct influence or financing from his side any more," he insists. Long before the Turkish government tried to shut the schools down, other countries took action of their own amid suspicion of the network's foreign links. In 2000, Uzbekistan shut down all Gulen-associated schools operating there, and similar steps were taken in Russia, where only seven remain of the 50 schools that used to operate until 2008. All are now firmly under Education Ministry supervision in the Turkic-speaking Muslim region of Tatarstan. The schools describe themselves as secular, promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue. "In my five years at the school I never once saw a Koran or a Bible," says Maxim Urazaev, from Kazan. But in Russia and elsewhere schools have been accused of running extra-curricular and secret, religious study groups. Many former Soviet countries are deeply suspicious of religious activity beyond state control. A former teacher in Tatarstan rejected the idea of "secret gatherings" but told the BBC that pupils who wanted to could pray with their teachers and talk to them about religion. In Kenya, former students and teachers showed us books by Fethullah Gulen that they had been given. In Kyrgyzstan, 15-year-old Zainal said pupils were sometimes shown videos about Islam. But her mother, Bakhtigul, said she was satisfied it was not a problem. "I even checked the books in their library to see if they had any Gulen literature or suspicious books, but there was nothing." Gulen-affiliated schools have existed in Turkey since the 1970s and only expanded into a truly global phenomenon in the past 20 years. That expansion came as Fethullah Gulen grew closer to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamist-rooted AK Party swept to victory in 2002. By teaching Turkish and promoting Turkish culture the schools helped to reinforce Turkey's position and influence across the former Soviet Union, the Far East and into Africa. In 2015 Turkey invested $6.2bn (Â£4.7bn; â‚¬5.5bn) across Africa. Somalia became a flagship for Turkish aid and investment, with three Gulen-linked schools catering for more than 1,000 children. Although the schools are fee-paying and attract the children of the elite, they also offer scholarships to poorer families. In Pakistan up to a quarter of children are on scholarships, in Afghanistan it is nearly 30%. Quite apart from the lure of a good education, the schools also offer an opportunity to travel by way of inter-school competitions known as "Olympiads". Star pupils from Kabul have competed in maths and Turkish-language competitions in Uganda, while children from Mogadishu have tested their skills in Kazakhstan. The schools say the competitions are a way of making a global network of friends. But Turkey argues they enable a movement responsible for a deadly coup attempt to continue recruiting new members worldwide. Thousands of children and their families have been left feeling vulnerable, and for many their future at the Gulen schools is unclear. "I've been here for eleven years," says Musukan, a sixth former at the Pak-Turk school in Islamabad. "This was the best time of my life. We love it here." "If Turkey really has problems, don't involve us," says Salwa, an Indonesian sixth former. "We're only here to study and to pursue our dreams."

The 20-year-old England international passed a medical and agreed personal terms with the club on Thursday in a deal reported to be worth £20m. Henderson, the club's first summer signing, signed what Liverpool described as 'a long-term deal'. "I'm over the moon, overjoyed to be here and I'm really looking forward to it," Henderson told the Liverpool website. "Obviously it's hard to leave your local club. I'm a Sunderland lad, I've supported them all my life. "But I'm really looking forward to the future now and obviously this is a massive opportunity for me. I'm really excited by it." Steven Gerrard is one of the best players in the world, you want to be playing with him and training with him to try and improve yourself as a player The midfielder, whose one and only cap for England came last November against France, has now joined the England Under-21 squad in Denmark ahead of the European Championship. The Black Cats had rejected Liverpool's previous offer for the player, which was thought to be worth £16m. Striker David Ngog, 22, could move in the opposite direction as part of the deal, but that is yet to be confirmed. Henderson will provide competition in the Reds' midfield, which already boasts internationals Steven Gerrard, Lucas Leiva, Raul Meireles and Christian Poulsen. "Coming to a massive club like Liverpool, there is always going to be competition," added Henderson. "Hopefully I can keep working hard, keep improving, and get my chance on the pitch. "(Gerrard) is one of the best players in the world, you want to be playing with him and training with him to try and improve yourself as a player. Hopefully I can learn a lot from him." Reds director of football Damien Comolli said of the deal: "I'm very pleased because he was one of the targets we had and when you get your first target it's always a good sign because you think the others will come through as well. "He has got all the skills technically that we needed," he added. "He's good with the ball, he's creative, he's got good passing, he's physically very good. "That's everything we wanted in a midfielder and he's versatile as well. For manager Kenny Dalglish he will be the player we wanted." The Sunderland-born Henderson, who had a loan spell at Coventry City early in his career, signed a five-year contract at the Stadium of Light in April 2010. He came to prominence as Steve Bruce's Black Cats made a fine start to the season and was rewarded with an England call-up by coach Fabio Capello. And though his form dipped as Sunderland struggled in the second half of the campaign, Henderson is still regarded as one of England's brightest young prospects. Manchester United had been regarded as the long-time favourites to sign Henderson after he made an outstanding start to last season, but their interest cooled and manager Sir Alex Ferguson has moved on to other midfield targets.	Liverpool have completed the signing of Jordan Henderson from Sunderland.
Kelly, 25, returned late from a trip home to Australia and was dropped for Saturday's Qualifiers loss to Leigh. Peacock said talks are "ongoing" about resolving the disciplinary issue and whether he will face London on Sunday. Asked if Kelly had a future at the club next season, Peacock told BBC's Super League Show: "It's all down to Albert. At the moment, it's all up in the air." Kelly has been an influential figure for Hull KR since joining at the start of 2015, helping the Robins to last season's Challenge Cup final. A win over Leigh would have put Rovers second in the Qualifiers table, but a 25-18 home defeat left them fourth and battling to preserve their Super League status for next season. Former England captain Peacock continued: "It was a difficult decision to make because at times Albert has played very well for us this year, and just the enormity of the game. "But you show compassion and give someone time to go home, and they stay longer and hamper your preparation for potentially the biggest game of our year so far - you have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. "It's disappointing for me, but his actions end up letting the club, the players and the fans down because he wants to do something outside what we're trying to do as a club." Meanwhile, stand-off Maurice Blair will miss the game against London after being allowed to return home to Australia to attend the funeral of his brother.	Hull KR head of rugby Jamie Peacock is unsure if half-back Albert Kelly will remain at the club in 2017.
The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits. It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to "ever closer union" with other EU member states, he said. EU exit campaigners said the "hollow" deal offered only "very minor changes". Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June. Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump. The key points of the deal are: The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members. Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment. On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals,  Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead. The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: "Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU." German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would "elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU". Mr Tusk said it "strengthens Britain's special status", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as "fair". Mr Tusk added: "We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity. "I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people." The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him. The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement. The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK. The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto. But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing. Read more from Laura Mr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK "in the driving seat" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a "more flexible" EU. "We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it," he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU "has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency". The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: "Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate." Outlining his case to remain "in a reformed Europe", Mr Cameron said "turning our back on the EU is no solution at all". "We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey," he added. "The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a "sideshow" designed to "appease his opponents in the Conservative Party," adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay. "We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers," he said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now "more important than ever" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case "as strongly as possible". Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron "will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one". UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: "This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing Â£55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity." As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster. Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain "to take  control of its own destiny", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was "absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy". Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a "special guest" at the rally, describing him as a "towering figure on the left of British politics".	David Cameron says a deal struck with EU leaders will give the UK "special status" and he will campaign with his "heart and soul" to stay in the union.
Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight. It says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people. UK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. Beat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence. Teens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say. Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. Beat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities. The charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states "this is not a weight loss product". The Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets. Dulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them. The Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6. Both and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). "We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way," Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog. "And that does include a significant number of young people as well," she added. Lottie Hall is 17 years old. She started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was 13 and now has long term damage from laxative abuse. "At first it would start with just a few, 4 or 5. Over time my body just got used to it and in the end I could be taking 20 to 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect. "It was a long time, probably about 3 years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it. "They'll be times where I'm out and all of a sudden it gets really uncomfortable and I have no control over it. "I was a school once and I was in the corridor and was crouching down and holding my stomach in agony and my friend found me and she asked me what was wrong and I had to tell her and it was a really embarrassing situation. "She actually had to tell my teacher and my teacher had to tell my mum." In 2009 Beat warned Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda that children were buying the medicine in large quantities. But the charity says nothing was done. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and according to research from Beat, 80% of those surveyed by the charity admitted that they had misused laxatives in order to lose weight. Dr Babu Vadamalayan, a paediatrician and gastroenterologist at Kings and St Thomas Hospital, told BBC Watchdog that the eating disorder unit at Maudsley Hospital say they see 140 under 18s with eating disorders every year and 10-15% of them are abusing laxatives. As part of an investigation, BBC Watchdog sent four 14-year-old actors into 25 branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Boots stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. The actors were not stopped or questioned by staff in any of the stores, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets in each store. MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recognise the concern. The body says it has consulted independent experts and believes that restricting the sale of laxatives or reducing pack sizes would not be appropriate. However, it adds that it is working with manufacturers to get stronger warnings printed on products and will monitor their safety and take further action if necessary. Boots and the four supermarkets said that they fully comply with current government and MHRA regulations on selling laxatives. Sainsbury's and Boots added that they are retraining their staff to better identify signs of laxative misuse. You can see the full report on BBC Watchdog at 20:00 BST on Thursday 16 October.	The UK's leading eating disorder charity has called for the sale of laxatives to children to be more strictly regulated.

The research, by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu, has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world. One of them, malaria, most people have heard of. But the other two illnesses, onchocerciasis or "river blindness" and lymphatic filariasis or "elephantiasis" - both caused by roundworm parasites  - are lesser known. People catch these worms from bites from infected insects such as flies or mosquitoes. Left untreated, the worms grow and multiply, causing disabling symptoms in their host. The drug ivermectin kills the first larval stage of the parasite - the babies of adult female worms. William C Campbell discovered this by studying bacteria living in soil samples obtained by Satoshi Omura from a Japanese golf course in Ito City, in the Shizuoka region. One particular strain of bacterium, Streptomyces avermitilis, caught his eye because of its potent anti-parasitic properties. Working with drug company Merck and Co, he then set about purifying this agent. Since 1987, Merk (MSD) has given ivermectin away free to those countries that need it most. Last year, it donated more than 300 million doses to treat river blindness and elephantiasis. Meanwhile, Chinese scientist Youyou Tu had been focusing her attentions in the 1960s and 70s on finding a new treatment for malaria. The staples quinine and chloroquine were failing because the parasite that causes malaria - Plasmodium falciparum - had learned how to evade their attack. Disheartened by the lack of effective drugs to tackle this mosquito-borne disease, the professor turned to traditional medicine to hunt for a new option. She found that an extract from the sweet wormwood plant Artemisia annual was sometimes effective - but the results were inconsistent, so she went back to ancient literature, including a recipe from AD350. This ancient document - Ge Hong's A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies - recommended a handful of qinghao [the Chinese name for the plant extract] immersed in two litres of water, "wring out the juice and drink it all". This she did (with a few tweaks), testing it on herself as well as animals in her lab. She said: "During the Cultural Revolution, there were no practical ways to perform clinical trials of new drugs. So, in order to help patients with malaria, my colleagues and I bravely volunteered to be the first people to take the extract. "After ascertaining that the extract was safe for human consumption, we went to the Hainan province to test its clinical efficacy, carrying out antimalarial trials with patients," she wrote in Nature Medicine. Her discovery eventually led to the creation of an antimalarial drug - artemisinin - that is still relied upon today. The World Health Organization credits the expanding access to artemisinin-based combination therapies in malaria-endemic countries as a key factor in driving down deaths in recent years. In 2013, 392 million ACT treatment courses were procured by endemic countries - up from 11 million in 2005. But artemisinin-resistant strains of malaria are emerging. As of February 2015, artemisinin resistance had been confirmed in five countries: And so the quest for new drugs continues.	The Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine has been split two ways for groundbreaking work on parasitic diseases.
The crash, involving several vehicles, happened on the southbound carriageway, near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, at about 07:30 GMT on Thursday. The 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention. The road was closed between Thursley and Liphook until early evening while officers investigated the scene.	A cyclist has died after being in a crash with a car on the A3 in Hampshire.
Josh Earnest said the closure of the Cuban detention camp was a national security interest. It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008. Inmates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year, 122 men were left. The peak population in 2003 was 684. Mr Earnest said the administration was "in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly (close) the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that to Congress". He added: "That has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time, primarily because it is a priority of the president." In 2009, President Obama admitted the January 2010 deadline he had set for closing the counter-terrorism facility would be missed. Since then, Congress bipartisan opposition has meant the transfer of prisoners to the US has been blocked. Some have been considered too dangerous to be released, but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them. The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut. The camp was established in 2002 by the Bush administration to detain the most dangerous suspects for interrogation and the prosecution of war crimes. Controversy has centred around the period of time detainees have been held without charge and the use of interrogation techniques.	The White House is in the "final stages" of drafting a plan to close the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay, a spokesman has said.

The Hull 2017 Culture Company said fundraising had exceeded its public target of £18m, raised with investment from 61 partners. The full programme of events is to be announced next week. Martin Green, of Hull 2017, said the money was "a massive vote of confidence" in the city. The chief executive and director of Hull 2017 said Hull was a "great city" and "the northern powerhouse argument was a good one". Mr Green admitted his personal target for funding had been about £30m. He was the man behind the London 2012 Olympic ceremonies, oversaw the torch relays ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 and was the executive producer of the Tour de France's opening ceremony in Leeds. About £22m will be spent on cultural events and another portion of the money will support events after 2017, the charity said. More than 2,000 people have already signed up to volunteer during the year and 60,000 school students will take part in some way.	Hull City of Culture 2017 has raised £32m to produce the year-long festival, according to the charity set up to deliver it.
The former Scunthorpe, Sheffield Wednesday and Preston player worked with Blackpool manager Gary Bowyer as a trainee at Blackburn.

Francois Hollande was taking part in a ceremony to mark 70 years since Allied troops liberated the last Nazi camps at the end of World War Two. "The worst can always happen," Mr Hollande said at the site of Natzweiler-Struthof in Alsace. "We prevent it by knowing." Most of the 50,000 inmates were French resistance fighters, but they also included Jews and gypsies. By the time of its liberation, almost half the prisoners had died. The Nazis built and tested one of their first gas chambers at the camp. France has been grappling with rising attacks on both Jews and Muslims after deadly shootings by Islamist gunmen in January, sparking fresh debate about growing social tensions, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris. Commemorations have also been held in northern Germany to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where an estimated 70,000 people were killed, including the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank. The president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder, remembered the first shocking images to emerge from the camp. "We saw the bulldozers pushing naked bodies into open pits," he said, according to AFP news agency. He remembered "the walking skeletons, the unbelievable sadness and loss," at a ceremony attended by about 70 survivors. Another emotional ceremony took place at the site of another camp - Jasenovac in Croatia - to mark the 70th anniversary of an escape attempt by about 600 inmates. Only 80 or 90 inmates escaped, with the rest shot by guards.	France's president has warned that anti-Semitism and racism "are still here" on a visit to the only Nazi concentration camp on French soil.
Speaking after talks with his Turkish counterpart in Ankara, the UK prime minister said Islamic State (IS) was a "common enemy" that must be confronted. He hailed the countries' existing intelligence co-operation and said this would be stepped up further. The US and EU want Turkey to take a more active role in tackling IS. At a press conference in the capital, Turkey's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the two countries shared a "strong and common political will" to address the threat posed by foreign fighters travelling to and from conflict zones in Syria and Iraq. Mr Cameron said that British jihadists had "sometimes" passed through Turkey and the two men had had "productive discussions" over how they could be detained and, if possible, prosecuted. The UK government is seeking greater powers to confiscate the passports of people returning to the UK from Iraq and Syria who are thought to pose a threat to national security, with Parliament currently debating changes to the law. Asked whether Turkey could be doing more to identify and stop suspects at its borders, Mr Cameron said the two countries were already working "as closely as we possibly can" to tackle the threat. He said: "Whether it is about stopping people coming through Turkey to Syria or Iraq to fight for Islamic State, whether it's about making sure we deal with people when they return, whether it is the highest levels of intelligence co-operation that we can possibly achieve between our countries, this is all about making sure people are safer in Turkey and making sure people are safer back home in the UK." As well as addressing the "extremist ideology" that fuels Islamic State, he reiterated his calls for a transition to a more democratic and representative government in Syria and more efforts towards reconciliation by the new government in Baghdad. Mr Cameron also hailed a growth in economic links between the UK and Turkey, saying bilateral trade had increased by 60% since 2010. Making his first visit to Turkey since 2010, Mr Cameron will later be hosted at a dinner by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr Cameron will not return to the UK in time for Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, with Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg expected to step in for him.	David Cameron has said the UK and Turkey are working "hand in glove" to prevent British jihadists returning home after fighting in Iraq and Syria.
Scottish FA regulations prohibit players from betting on any football. Annan Athletic chairman Henry McClelland and Inverness player Lewis Horner were this week charged by the national body with gambling offences. "We have to have an adult conversation regarding a number of issues relating to gambling," Wishart said. "The effectiveness of the rule when people are still gambling, is it fit for purpose in the modern day, why are individuals still gambling, are there financial problems, mental health problems, addictions behind the scenes? "Since the rule was brought into place, there's been nobody charged with spot-fixing or match-fixing, which is very, very important, and therefore the game perhaps is suffering from poor headlines and I don't think the situation at the moment is helping the image of Scottish football." Wishart admits he is uncertain whether the existing regulations are adequate, and reiterates his belief that Scottish football's authorities must join forces to tackle the problem. "Sometimes I move from one side to the other," Wishart told BBC Scotland of his appraisal of the rules. "I can absolutely see why the rule is in place, because we want to stop and discourage people from spot or match-fixing. And that was the original purpose of the regulation. "But since then, [the Scottish FA] have brought in a specific regulation that addresses spot and match-fixing, and has much, much heavier sanctions. If we sit in Scottish football as stakeholders and don't do anything, don't address or discuss the issues then I don't think we're doing our jobs. "Because at the moment player after player, perhaps betting on games across Europe, now we've got a chairman and we may have others as well, traipsing up the steps at Hampden to massive negative headlines, and I don't think it's doing our game any good. I would just call for a proper and adult discussion on all these issues." PFA Scotland's chairman, former Dundee United midfielder John Rankin, told BBC Scotland in April that gambling is "rife" throughout Scottish football. Ex-Inverness player Barry Wilson believes there should be an amnesty for players regarding historical bets - a suggestion Wishart says should be considered. "Certainly, we should be looking at and considering an amnesty," Wishart added. "There are a number of people who have been charged for what are ostensibly historical issues going back a number of years when perhaps they weren't aware on the rules. "So I thought perhaps an amnesty would give us a start from zero, and then with a renewed education programme we cam move on from there. "We're trying to address the issue and the individual. We see the problems individuals have that perhaps people in the public don't see, where people have mental health problems, financial problems and addiction issues, which are huge things. "I think we have to get away from the headline-makers - are people breaching the regulations? Yes, they are. That's wrong and if people are breaching a rule, we have to look at the effectiveness of that rule, and the issues around that, and that's where we're trying to take the conversation."	PFA Scotland's chief executive Fraser Wishart argues the effectiveness of Scottish football's gambling rules should be examined.
Walker, who has 27 caps and spent eight seasons at Spurs has signed a five-year deal with City. The deal, which comes to £50m including £5m of add-ons, could make him the most expensive English player ever. "I am thrilled to be signing for City and can't wait to get started," said Walker. "Pep Guardiola is one of the most respected managers in the world." Walker, who joined Spurs from Sheffield United in 2009 and made 183 Premier League appearances, added: "I feel he can help me take my game to a new level." The 27-year-old, who will wear the number two shirt, is expected to travel with City on Monday for their tour of the USA. City boss Guardiola released three full-backs at the end of last season, including both right-sided players - Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna. He missed out on the signing of free agent Dani Alves, with the Brazilian joining Paris St-Germain on Wednesday. Walker, selected in the 2016-17 Premier League team of the year, is City's third signing of the summer, after the arrivals of midfielder Bernardo Silva and goalkeeper Ederson Moraes. Walker made 31 league starts under Mauricio Pochettino last season as Tottenham recorded their highest top-flight finish since the 1962-63 season. The right-back recorded five assists for the Premier League runners-up, the joint-most for a defender in the division alongside Bournemouth's Adam Smith and Spurs team-mate Kieran Trippier, who made six of his 12 appearances from the bench. Walker also ranked highly among chances created by defenders and his 75 dribbles attempted was only less than Cherries full-back Smith (87) and Watford's Jose Holebas (88). Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter: Kyle Walker becomes the world's most expensive defender at £50m plus. Imagine how much he would cost if he could cross the ball. Former Spurs midfielder and Match of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas‏ on Twitter: I think it's great business for City. I am surprised Spurs are selling to a direct competitor.

"Every Premier League club now has more money and are willing to spend that on players," said Chris Stenson, a senior consultant from Deloitte's sports business group. "It is the wealthiest league in the world and increasing its value makes it more attractive to sponsors and commercial partners.

There have been calls for reform of the system, which often sees highly-paid council chiefs get extra payments of tens of thousands of pounds. Holyrood's local government committee is to examine how the payments are made and how appropriate they are. Convener Bob Doris said there was "understandable public concern" about the sums being paid out. Returning officers have been in high demand in recent years, with Scotland going to the polls for five elections and referendums across three years. It is estimated that almost Â£500,000 was shared between the 32 returning officers inside a matter of weeks in 2016, due to the Holyrood election and the EU referendum. Mr Doris said the total sum may stretch to Â£1m over two years when the 2015 general election is taken into account. The SNP MSP said: "The level of payment varies for different elections and different councils, and we're also aware some returning officers claim their payment, while others share payments with their staff. We want to find out more about how these payments operate, what their uptake is and whether they remain appropriate." Returning officers are responsible for ensuring the smooth running of elections at a local, national and European level, as well as referendums. The role is often carried out by council chief executives on top of their normal duties. MSPs will hear from electoral law experts and local government officials, trade unions and academics as well as returning officers across two meetings in November.	MSPs are to examine the payments received by election returning officers in Scotland.
Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He was found safe and well the same day. Mahon, 41, admitted one charge of kidnap at Shrewsbury Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Judge Robin Onions told the defendant she was likely to receive a custodial sentence "of some length". During a hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court last month the prosecutor told the court the kidnap had been "pre-planned". Kelly Crowe told magistrates on 26 February: "When officers go around there (to Mahon's home) a number of baby items were present; cots, clothes, baby clothes, both female and male and also a to-do list. "She made reference to sterilisers, nappies, and milk for babies." The case has been adjourned until 12 May.	A woman has admitted kidnapping a nine-week-old baby boy in Telford.
Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill. They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season. "There's a lot more to come from this team," Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport. "Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season. "I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically." Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third. They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final. Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition. The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop. "A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script'," he said. "We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time. "We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point. "We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints. "We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game. "The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other. "One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case."	Leicester Tigers assistant coach Geordan Murphy says victory in Sunday's Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Exeter would be a big boost for their Premiership play-off aspirations.
The 36-year-old former Coventry City, Derby County, Stoke City and Watford midfielder has signed a one-year deal and will take charge in the summer. "I want someone who can take the club forward towards league football," chief executive Colin Gordon said. Gordon also said they hope to tie up a deal for Worcester City joint boss Matt Gardiner to work alongside Eustace. "I've been working hard for a long time to get the perfect team together," Gordon, who has been in temporary charge of the first team since January, told BBC Hereford and Worcester. "I was very concerned we needed the knowledge of the league we're going into. We've got balance and all bases covered." Harriers have endured a turbulent season on and off the field, with the departures of Gary Whild and Dave Hockaday as managers and the pressure of severe financial difficulties. Media playback is not supported on this device Relegation from the top tier of non-league football was confirmed with Saturday's failure to beat Barrow. But with the club now of a much firmer financial footing, Gordon says the arrival of Solihull-born Eustace will take them to a new level. "He's a winner - a brilliant character and one of the best I've come across as a player in terms of coping with pressure," he added. "It would have been easier for him to have gone somewhere else as a coach and shadowing someone but that's not John's character - he's always been the boss in the dressing rooms he's been in." Harriers, who are set to be in National League North next season, take on Dover in their final home game of the season on Saturday before finishing the campaign at Southport on 30 April.	Relegated National League club Kidderminster Harriers have appointed John Eustace as their new manager.
Chasing 268 in the first Test, Australia were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia - the world's top-ranked Test side - had a first-innings lead of 86. But Kusal Mendis' superb 176 - his first Test century - and 5-54 from Rangana Herath proved decisive. Australia captain Steve Smith made a gritty 55 before tail-enders Steve O'Keefe and Peter Nevill resisted for 178 balls, scoring four. The second Test of the three-match series takes place in Galle, starting on Thursday, 4 August. O'Keefe and Nevill's ninth-wicket stand came at just 0.13 runs an over, before debutant Dhananjaya de Silva had Nevill caught behind. The previous record for a partnership lasting 100 balls or more was 0.64 by South Africa's Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers against India last December. Australia survived just 15 further deliveries before Herath claimed his ninth wicket of the match to secure Sri Lanka's first win over the Baggy Greens since 1999, and second in 27 attempts.	Sri Lanka beat Australia by 106 runs in Pallekele to claim only their second Test victory over the tourists, who set a Test match record in defeat.
Malcolm Layfield, 63, denies raping an 18-year-old from Chetham's School of Music in the early 1980s. Manchester Crown Court heard the attack occurred during a trip to Cornwall. Prosecutor David Cadwallader said the alleged victim didn't complain at the time "because nobody would have believed her back then." She said Mr Layfield plied her with drink, took her to a remote spot in his car and raped her. The court heard the student went on to have a consensual relationship with Mr Layfield. But Mr Cadwallader said she only "went along" with it despite her reluctance, because the teacher was "critical" to her success at the school and future career. "It is alleged, in short, that he used his power and influence improperly," the prosecutor said. "He admits that he had inappropriate sexual relationships with a number of female students. "The complainant in this case was one such student." During a filmed interview shown to the jury, the woman described the encounter alleged to have taken place in Mr Layfield's car. "He was going to have sex with me and there wasn't a thing I could do about it. "I gave in and I have hated myself for that ever since." Mr Layfield, of Castle Quay, Castlefield, also taught at Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM). In 2001, the woman wrote to RNCM alleging Mr Layfield had been involved in inappropriate relationships with students. He was later promoted to head of strings, Mr Cadwallader said. The trial continues.	A former professor at a prestigious music school used his "power and influence" in order to rape a female student, a court has heard.
The Football League wants to create an extra division with 20 teams in each from 2019-20. It would mean England has 100 teams in five divisions, up from 92. There are currently 24 teams in the Championship, League One and League Two. The Football League says the move would tackle fixture congestion and boost the finances of its members. The Premier League and the Football Association have backed the proposal "in principle". Of the current 72 Football League clubs, 90% must support the proposal for it to go ahead. A decision will be made at their annual general meeting in June 2017. "There are clear benefits for everyone," Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey told BBC Sport. "It is about taking a step back to try to work out what is best for English football. "We hope that the Football League taking this first step is the catalyst for future change." However, the proposal has attracted mixed reaction from Football League clubs. Accrington owner Andrew Holt said it had "no merit", while former Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn believes it "has value". Other club bosses complained they had not been told about the plan before it was announced on Thursday. 'Football League shake-up would see clubs struggle financially' The Football League believes the move would help: Harvey said the Premier League and the FA have backed the idea in principle because "they can see potential benefits on an international basis". "The whole game needs to come together," he added. "It is about finding solutions that supports English football for the future." The FA said the fixture schedule needs looking at "for the benefit of all". "These are interesting draft proposals and we look forward to further discussions over the coming months," it added. Mark Lawn, the joint-chairman of Bradford City, believes the current system should not be changed. "We've had this structure for years because it has suited the majority of clubs, so why change it?" said Lawn, whose team are taking part in the League One play-offs. "What they don't understand is that currently we have 23 home games. We need the crowds. Losing four home games means we lose four incomes." Brentford chief executive Mark Devlin thinks the Football League should be praised for an "innovative and far-reaching approach". "These proposals are a really good start for how we can tackle some of the problems Football League clubs are facing," he added. For the proposal to be approved, it needs the backing of 65 Football League clubs (90%) at next year's AGM. The Football League says its board is offering "no recommendation other than asking its members to give full consideration to the proposal". The decision will have to be confirmed by November 2017. Relegation from the Football League would be scrapped in the 2018-19 season, How the promotion/relegation system would work during 2018-19 is still to be determined. Rotherham chairman Tony Stewart said he was concerned the proposal could widen existing financial gulfs between the divisions. "There is also a divide between the Championship and League One and Two and the gaps need filling in," he added. Currently, the bottom two teams in League Two are relegated from the Football League to the National League. They would not go down at the end of the 2018-19 season, said Harvey. Six other clubs - in addition to the two clubs already promoted from the National League - would join the Football League. "The logical place for the extra clubs to come from would be promoting the next six teams from the National League," said Harvey. "Some of those teams are already professional and the extension to the league may suit them." Scottish Premiership sides Celtic and Rangers have long been linked with moving into the English pyramid. In 2009, Premier League clubs voted to reject a proposal to bring the Old Firm rivals into the English top flight. Harvey has not ruled out the involvement of the Glasgow clubs, but added such a move would be difficult. But he dismissed suggestions Premier League clubs could field B teams in the lower divisions. Former Leyton Orient chairman Hearn told Sky Sports: "[Premier League B teams] would destroy the fabric of the Football League. It is poorly thought and would be a sell-out to the Premier League." The major impact would be felt by Football League clubs, who would see their number of matches reduced from 46 to 38 per season. Despite the potential of losing revenue from three fewer home matches, Harvey has asked the 72 clubs to take a "broader view of English football". "We have to make sure none of our clubs are in a financially worse position," he added. "Our clubs shouldn't be the only one to shoulder the burden. We won't be looking for clubs to take a financial haircut to support this. "We believe focusing on weekend games will, over period of time, drive bigger attendances and increase quality of performance on the pitch." Accrington owner Andrew Holt believes the new structure, if approved, would have costly financial implications for many lower league clubs. Holt said the Lancashire club would not be voting in favour of the proposal. He said: "We don't want to lose any games. We'd rather play 50 home games. because we need revenue. "If were going to play 20 times a year it's hardly worth having a stadium. I can't see any sense or any logic in the proposals. "It's just not going to get our support. I need them coming up with better ideas where we can get more games on and generate more revenue for our clubs. "These bottom clubs don't have a lot of revenue and we need to build it, not reduce it." Long midweek trips across the country for fans are "in the main" going to disappear, said Harvey. "There a hardcore of fans who are more than happy to go length and breadth of the country," he added. "But I think less games will make the Saturday at a stadium more special and more important. "It is going to be interesting to see how fans accept this. I'm hopeful it will be positive." The Football Supporters' Federation, a democratic organisation representing the rights of fans in England and Wales, said it would consult supporters at all levels. "The fans' voice has to be heard in this debate," it added.

English football could be heading for its biggest shake-up since the creation of the Premier League in 1992.
These are the close-up views provided by academics from Mosul, who have maintained covert contacts linking the city with the outside world. They claim that foreign fighters, once visible in Mosul, have disappeared from the city. "The frontline foreign fighters are rarely there. They've vanished. The houses they occupied are vacant," said one source, speaking anonymously. "They're leaving it to the local fighters, who will become the scapegoats." The IS leadership in the city is also described as "melting away". "It's a lost cause. It's the end of days for them," says one of the scholars from Mosul, who have been supported by the New York-based Institute of International Education, which once rescued academics in Europe from the Nazis. They also talk of "changed tactics", with IS fighters trimming their beards and changing the way they dress to look more like the civilian population - with Mosul residents assuming this is to make them less distinguishable if the city is overrun. Cars in the city have been forced to switch to Islamic State number plates, says one of the academics. The fear from civilians is that this could make all cars vulnerable to an air strike or put them at risk of being attacked in the battle for the city. So far, air strikes have been carefully targeted at government buildings and military sites, according to this view from the city. Another says that this accuracy might seem "impossible" but so far the attacks have been on "confirmed" targets. Mosul University, once one of the biggest universities in the Middle East, had been kept open by the IS authorities when they seized the city in 2014. It had raised questions about whether its laboratories were being used to develop weapons, including for chemical warfare, which could be used in battle or against civilians. But sources now say that this is "no longer an issue" as the university has been pulverised by air strikes. "The university is completely inoperative and air strikes have made it a difficult place to go. Most of the buildings have been brought down, it's virtually gone. The laboratories are destroyed." It is expected there will be "chlorine rockets", but doubts about anything more sophisticated. Another source says that "Daesh used the university to store some weapons" and had blocked access to some sections of laboratories. "It is believed that they used laboratories for terrorist purposes, but it is almost impossible to confirm such claims." But it's assumed that the laboratories would have had chemicals - and that the IS forces might have carried out experiments, such as adding chemicals to explosives. But the destruction of the university is claimed to have stopped any further weapons development. Although there is a claim that "Daesh insurgents are still inside the university to 'protect' it from any emergency situation". As the Iraqi government forces, militias and Kurdish Peshmerga close in on the city, there are signs of deepening tensions between the IS regime and the local population, according to sources. The city's people are said to be in a "state of fear and terror". As IS has been targeted by the coalition forces, they in turn have "put their anger on the people" claiming that Mosul's residents are communicating with "hostile parties to Daesh". At Friday prayers last week, a pro-IS preacher talked of how local people were "hypocrites" who had let down the "caliphate". The religious police are also trying to assert their authority and show that nothing has changed in their control - and there have been more gruesome public executions of people claimed to be opponents or informants. "They are trying to show they are in control of everything." There is a culture of "false accusations" and another Mosul academic says: "Daesh continues to hunt 'offenders' and punish them heavily," which often means the death penalty. The IS authorities have tried to clamp down on communications - but this doesn't seem to be effective. There had been highly-monitored public points for internet access, but these too have been shut down. But as the Iraqi forces advance on the city, internet providers have been boosting access in Mosul. It means that in some parts of the city it has been possible to make contact, but this is being carried out in elaborate and extremely cautious ways to keep such links secret. Such communication is described as being immensely dangerous, but there is a great hunger for news. A source says there is a "great risk of punishment", which would be execution. There is said to be a huge amount of excitement about the approaching forces. "People in Mosul are jubilant at the prospect of the city being liberated," says another local source. This optimism, at the early stages of the battle, is said to outweigh fears of the loss of civilian lives and the destruction of buildings. Tactics being used by the IS forces, such as digging tunnels, are seen as likely to be ineffective - and there is an expectation that they will be defeated. Then there will be questions about reconstruction and rebuilding - and there are questions about whether professionals who have fled the city will really want to come back. There are deep concerns about how the battle for Mosul might become a proxy for other sectarian disputes and score-settling, with so many opposing forces under the banner of the coalition attacking IS. There are also fears that politicians, with their own militias, could exploit the battle for their own advantage. Arguments also exist that this is a city exhausted by bloodshed and desperate for peace and moderation. For two years of the IS occupation and for a decade before, there has been so much conflict, destruction and extremism. Mosul has been "saturated with violence" and this long "trauma" must end.	The forces of so-called Islamic State, now besieged in Mosul, are in a state of "frenzy" inside the city, increasingly blaming and terrorising the local population and preparing to conceal themselves if defeated.
The county council plans to prohibit buses, taxis and private hire vehicles from using Queen Street. Oxford Bus Company said the authority needed to consider the "additional pressure" on surrounding streets. The council said it was "vital" for more pedestrians and cyclists to use the route. Oxford bus Company said: "We can't have a situation where Queen Street is pedestrianised but the additional pressure put on surrounding streets means that waiting conditions for bus passengers become unbearable, or walks between stops become unacceptably long - or our customers can't get taken to where they want to go. "A credible, agreed plan therefore needs to be identified between all parties before Queen Street can be closed and dialogue is ongoing to achieve this." Oxfordshire County Council said the street was one of the main routes across the city centre and added pedestrian and cycle numbers were expected to increase "significantly" in the future due to development across the city. "It is vital that strong pedestrian and cycle links are maintained and encouraged, and improvements to the pedestrian experience are made, to ensure a well-connected and joined up city centre that will continue to thrive," it added. A consultation on the proposals runs until 6 June.	A "credible plan" needs to be agreed before any move to ban buses and taxis from a street in Oxford is made, a bus company has said.
"Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!" he tweeted early on Friday. Mr Comey told Congress under oath he believed he was fired to influence his investigation into the Trump campaign. The ex-FBI boss led one of several Russia inquiries before he was sacked. It is not clear what falsehoods Mr Trump is referring to but his lawyer has rejected as untrue several key parts of Mr Comey's testimony. Mr Comey, who testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, said the president pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn was himself forced out after misleading the vice-president about conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office. Mr Comey also said the president defamed him and the FBI by claiming the agency was "poorly led", which Mr Comey called "lies, plain and simple". He said he began writing memos after his meetings with Mr Trump because he was "honestly worried he might lie". He leaked details of his memos after an account of it had already been published in the press. As a result of that episode, a special counsel was appointed to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. But there is no known evidence of collusion between Russia and the US, and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as "fake news". After the hearing, the president's personal lawyer issued a statement rejecting many of Mr Comey's allegations. Marc Kasowitz said on Thursday that the president never sought to impede the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election and that Mr Comey's leaks should be investigated. He also said the testimony confirmed that Mr Trump was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian political meddling. Hours later, Mr Trump ignored reporters when asked about whether Mr Comey was telling the truth.	US President Donald Trump has broken his Twitter silence after James Comey's explosive testimony to appear to accuse the former FBI chief of perjury.
A video in which the girl's father says that "everyone is welcome" to the party featuring local bands, a meal and a horse race was posted on Facebook on a public setting. He said the idea had been to invite neighbours and friends only. But he has since confirmed he would not turn anyone away. The video shows Crescencio Ibarra standing next to his daughter Rubi, wearing a tiara, and his wife Anaelda Garcia. "Hello, how are you? We invite you this 26 of December to the 15th birthday party of our daughter, Rubi Ibarra Garcia," Mr Ibarra says, while his daughter smiles. He then goes on to list the three bands that will play and announces that the winner of a horse race to be held as part of the event stands to win 10,000 pesos ($490; Â£390). He ends by saying that "hereby everyone is cordially invited". A girl's 15th birthday party is a big event in Mexico, as it is seen as the time when she comes of age. Lavish parties with live bands are not unusual and girls traditionally wear puffy dresses, tiaras and make-up as they are "queen for the day". It is not clear why this particular video went viral and was shared more than 800,000 times and prompted countless memes and imitations. Mr Ibarra said in a TV interview he had no idea what had caught the public's imagination. "We wanted to invite the people from the area, that's all," he said, before denying he had since uninvited all but personal acquaintances. Mr Ibarra said that when he found out about the mass interest in their daughter's party and how some had poked fun at their rural ways he had been "sad" for two days but that the family had now got used to the idea and that the party would go ahead in a field outside the village of La Joya, in the state of San Luis Potosi. Ms Garcia said: "Rubi is my daughter and she has always been our queen", before describing her favourite meme so far. "It's the one about Donald Trump and [Mexican President} Enrique Pena Nieto coming to an agreement to allow undocumented Mexican migrants in the US to return to Mexico for Rubi's party." Local lawmaker Roberto Alejandro Segovia Hernandez said police would be deployed to the village and the roads leading to it to ensure safety in case the crowds who said on Facebook they would attend really did descend on La Joya. But even that announcement prompted fresh memes: Rubi's older sister said Rubi was now "very excited" and looking forward to her party.	Police will be deployed to a village in Mexico after an invitation to a girl's birthday party went viral and 1.2 million people said they would attend.
Aaron Saucedo, 23, had already been charged with murder in connection with a killing in August 2015, police say. Now he has been linked to the deaths of eight other people, between January and July 2016. Police say they have not identified a motive but believe he acted alone. His lawyer has not commented. The 2015 victim was a 61-year-old man who had dated the suspect's mother, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams said. The other victims, including a 12-year-old girl and a 55-year-old woman, seem to have been targeted at random. "Today is a good day in the city of Phoenix," Mayor Greg Stanton said. Police gave few details on how they linked the man to the killings, which stopped last July amid extensive media coverage. But they said the evidence included surveillance video, witness statements and ballistics material. He faces 26 additional felony counts, including multiple counts of homicide, aggravated assault and drive-by shootings. The Maricopa County attorney has not yet decided which charges to formally bring against him.	Police in the US state of Arizona say a man arrested last month is responsible for a series of deadly shootings in Phoenix last year.
The plane came down en route to Russia from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. A group linked to so-called Islamic State (IS) said it bombed the plane. Nearly all the victims were Russians. Russia has said a bomb brought down the Metrojet Airbus, after finding what it said were "traces of foreign explosives" on the debris. It has vowed to "find and punish" the perpetrators. In response to Monday's findings, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov re-iterated that "our experts concluded this was a terrorist attack". Russian plane crash: What we know Russia suspended all flights to Egypt in the wake of the attack, with the UK also suspending flights to and from Sharm el-Sheikh. However, the head of the Egyptian committee investigating the crash, Ayman al-Muqaddim, was quoted by state TV on Monday as saying there was "no evidence that there is an act of terror or illegal intervention". IS-affiliate Sinai Province said it had destroyed the plane because of Russian air strikes on Syria. Last month IS's magazine published a photo of what it claimed was the improvised bomb that brought down the airliner. The picture in Dabiq showed a Schweppes Gold soda can and what appears to be a detonator and a switch. The crash has dealt another blow to Egypt's vital tourism industry, already struggling after years of unrest. Egypt's tourism minister told Reuters earlier this month that tourism revenues for 2015 will be at least 10% below last year's.	Egyptian investigators say they have so far found no evidence that terrorism caused a Russian jet to crash in the Sinai in October, killing 224 people.
Thanet District Council said it was considering a 2% rise in the authority's part of the council tax. Councillor Rick Everitt, cabinet member for finance, said the council had seen a 28% reduction in government funding over the past two years. "Further cuts to the council purse are really unwelcome," he said. The council said figures from the Department of Communities and Local Government showed the council was likely to be left short of £580,000 for the next financial year. Mr Everitt said: "Having already suffered a reduction of 28% in government funding over the past two years, resources are stretched to the absolute limit. "This additional reduction of over half a million pounds has forced us into a corner." From Monday, the council will be asking for residents' views on which services should be a priority. The council said final figures were expected in December and would be debated at a meeting in January.	A Kent council claims it is being "forced into a corner" as proposed cuts to government grants could leave a shortfall of more than £500,000.
Midfielder Jeff Hendrick has been ruled out because of a shoulder problem and has returned to his club Derby County. Harry Arter will miss the Dublin games because of an Achilles injury. The Bournemouth player, who has only one Republic cap, has returned to his club for treatment. Stoke City forward Walters sat out training sessions in Dublin over recent days. "Jeff has got a shoulder injury that he has had to deal with for quite a number of weeks now so we thought it best going back and getting is sorted a club level," said Republic manager Martin O'Neill. "Jon, I think he will be fit for Tuesday, he just thought he might be best to go home for a day or two. He should be back on Friday night to watch the game. He will definitely play on Tuesday. "Robbie Keane sat out training again on Wednesday but there is no real problem. He will be okay and will be available for any of the two games."

Kieran McGrath, 26, was shot after leaving the Sheldon Arms pub in Ashton-under-Lyne on 4 October 2014. He drove to a police station but died later. The man who orchestrated his killing, Anthony Henry, 32, was found guilty of murder on Friday. Troy Beckford, 24, and Jace Smith, 31, were convicted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. The jury was unable to agree in the case of two other men, Remi Adams, 34 and Scott Chapman, 27, also charged with murder. Mr Adams was found not guilty of possessing ammunition without a certificate. A woman, Bretony Gallimore, 24, was found guilty of assisting an offender. The gun used to kill Mr McGrath was the same gun used to kill Manchester shopkeeper Pragaret Singh three weeks later. Police believe the firearm was passed between criminals. Mr McGrath was shot after leaving the pub at about 22:25 BST. Anthony Henry had tracked Mr McGrath's Audi S3 and watched his movements on an iPad, the trial heard. After being shot, the 26-year-old drove away from the scene to a nearby police station but died after collapsing near the front door. He died from a single gunshot wound, a post-mortem examination found. No witnesses to the attack have come forward.	Two more men have been found guilty of murdering another man who was shot outside a Greater Manchester pub.
On sale at Foston's Fine Meats in Duns are scotch eggs - with a chocolate twist. For butcher Greg Foston has replaced the traditional hens' eggs with Cadbury's Creme Eggs. He has wrapped the Easter treats with sweet chilli pork meat which, he claims, compliments the chocolate "perfectly". It is the latest in a series of peculiar products created by Mr Foston. He said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark Wimbledon was a great success. "We are always discussing new flavours and combinations and wanted to come up with some way of combining chocolate eggs into one of our products," he said. "We did some experimenting with a plain pork sausage meat with the Creme Egg in the middle which we found was very tasty but needed something else. "So we decided upon sweet chilli pork sausage meat around the egg and found it complimented the chocolate perfectly. "The eggs are best eaten warmed up so the egg is melted in the middle." He estimated that they contain about 300 calories. Mr Foston added: "We are also concocting a pork sausage with whole Cadburys mini eggs actually inside the sausage."	A Borders butcher has created an "eggsperimental" delicacy to mark Easter.
Media playback is not supported on this device City, who shocked Chelsea en route to last season's quarter-final, went ahead from Kyel Reid's 18-yard finish before James Hanson's angled strike. Sam Youngs went close for Chesham, who play in the seventh tier and were 104 places below League One Bradford. Despite a cameo from Chesham's Barry Hayles, 43, Gary Liddle and Devante Cole scored in injury time. Chesham reached the second round after claiming their first ever Football League club scalp by defeating League Two Bristol Rovers, one of Hayles' former teams. But once Reid fired the home side ahead after latching on to Hanson's knock-down, Chesham faced a long afternoon. Hanson fired in a second after racing on to Lee Evans' long pass to make it 2-0 just before the break. Second-half substitutes Liddle and Cole flicked in from close range to complete a straightforward afternoon for the Bantams. Bradford manager Phil Parkinson: "We spoke to the lads about the experience of playing non-league teams last year and and what had to be done to get through. "We enjoyed the fantastic ties against Chelsea and Sunderland last year, but a lot of hard work had to be done to earn those, and we've done it here. "If we went back down to Chelsea we wouldn't argue with that. The lads involved and the fans around town are still talking about that cup run. "They are fantastic memories and they are the reason why we are all professional footballers. Everyone at Bradford is delighted to be back in the hat." Chesham manager Andy Leese: "We started okay and the manner in which we let in those (first) two goals was a shame because they were so predictable. "But there are over 100 places between the two sides and that was probably reflected in the score line. "It was a huge positive for us to reach this round and make history and the finances are incredible, season-changing stuff. "The excitement of the build-up to this game has been huge and there's a real sense of deflation in the dressing room. We have got a real pick-up job to do."

An 18-year-old woman was driving a Toyota Yaris when it was in a crash with a Ford Transit van on the A595 near Bootle at 19:55 BST on Friday. She and her front seat passenger, also 18, were pronounced dead at the scene. A third 18-year-old woman, in the back of the car, was flown by air ambulance to hospital where her condition is said to be "critical". The 51-year-old man driving the van was also flown to hospital, where he is in a serious but stable condition. The road was closed for six hours for the vehicles to be examined and then removed, Cumbria Police said. The force is appealing for witnesses.	Two teenagers have been killed and another seriously injured in a car crash in Cumbria.
At the Unite Scotland union's conference in Clydebank, Ms Dugdale accused the Scottish government of making cuts to schools and social care. Also speaking, UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn pledged that a future Labour government would repeal the Trade Union Bill. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be making a speech to delegates on Sunday. Ms Dugdale told the conference Scotland could not be a "fairer, more prosperous country" while councils were being "starved of the resources they need". She said: "We cannot build a better life for those children when their parents are amongst the thousands of local government workers who have lost their jobs or the 15,000 more who Cosla say could go as a result of John Swinney's Â£500m cut to our councils. "We should be cutting the gap between the richest and the rest, not the budget for our schools and the workers from our services. "I am calling on all trade unionists to join Scottish Labour and speak with one voice to say these SNP cuts to local councils responsible for our schools and social care just aren't acceptable." Mr Corbyn, who was delayed arriving in Scotland because of bad weather, said Labour was setting up a commission on workplace rights to be led by the Shadow Minister for Trade Unions, and former president of the National Union of Mineworkers, Ian Lavery MP. The Labour leader said: "Not only will we repeal the Trade Union Bill when we get back in 2020 we will extend people's rights in the workplace - and give employees a real voice in the organisations they work for. "That means new trade union freedoms and collective bargaining rights of course because it is only through collective representation that workers have the voice and the strength to reverse the race to the bottom in pay and conditions." Mr Corbyn said he was proud to be a member of a trade union and the unions would be "central to everything we do". An SNP spokeswoman said: "Kezia Dugdale should ask Jeremy Corbyn to support the SNP's calls for trade union laws to be devolved as Labour voted to leave these powers in David Cameron's hands, instead of allowing the Scottish Parliament to take a new and better approach, giving him carte blanche to undermine unions in Scotland." Among other issues being debated at the conference are debt, the oil industry, fracking and devolution. Meanwhile, Unite's general Secretary Len McCluskey is set to urge Labour to apologise for "betraying" Scotland to stem the drift towards the SNP which already claims two thirds of Unite's Scottish membership. Mr McCluskey will remind Scottish members that Unite is a Labour affiliated union and urge them to come back to Labour, in a speech on Sunday. He said: "The ideology of New Labour effectively alienated large swathes of the Scottish working class, which manifested itself quite dramatically last May. "Kezia has to effectively say: 'Labour is under new management, we apologise for betraying you, and we will start from scratch to try and build that trust up'."	Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has called on trade unionists to "unite against SNP cuts to local councils".
The harmless reptile was found inside the vehicle after it was dropped off at a yard on March 8 and rescued by animal collection officer Ellie West. While the snake is believed to have been in the van for some time, it is now "fine and well" in an animal shelter. Ms West said it was "a relief" it had been saved. Most corn snakes sold in the UK are bred in captivity, but have very complex and special needs. RSPCA Wales is appealing for information about where the snake may have come from or who the owner is.	A corn snake has been discovered in a Neath van destined for the scrapheap.
Matthew Williams was found attacking Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed on 6 November 2014. He was Tasered four times by police and arrested but later died. The Newport hearing was told he had previously made death and violence threats to his ex-girlfriend, probation service staff and a police officer. PC Jake Silver, who deals with prolific offenders through Gwent Police's Integrated Offender Management section, said Williams' former partner received seven letters from him while he was locked up. They contained threats of violence to her as well as threats towards a serving Detective Constable and the officer's wife and his children. In the letters, Williams described sending a car "up in smoke" and described one person as a "dead man walking". He described intending to serve his entire sentence - to negate the need to be on licence when released - so he could go "under the radar" when he was let out. PC Silver said he believed Williams was "very capable of carrying out the threats" but said the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was not enough evidence to peruse the matter as Williams' ex girlfriend was not willing to be a witness. PC Silver agreed there was a "lack of urgency" surrounding the letters because of an assumption Williams would remain in prison due to a pending court case, which later collapsed. The inquest continues.	A man who killed woman at a hostel had sent letters threatening to kill others while in prison, an inquest has heard.
The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has also warned Devonport in Plymouth might need enhanced monitoring until 2020 unless improvements are made. Special measures, including monthly inspections, were predicted to last two years when first imposed in 2013. Babcock, which carries out the refitting for the Ministry of Defence, said safety was its "highest priority". The ONR said its "enhanced regulatory attention" meant the once-a-month inspections of HMNB Devonport had "more effort and managerial attention". Its latest annual report blames safety concerns on "ageing facilities" and "increasing demands" as well as "stretched resources" for an unscheduled refuelling of HMS Vanguard later this year. Last December, Babcock was warned of legal action after a worker received a dose of radiation amid a series of safety breaches. ONR - KEY REPORT POINTS ON DEVONPORT DOCKYARD When Devonport was first placed under special measures in 2013, the ONR said the base was "expected to receive enhanced regulatory attention for around two years, as we anticipate the issues to be resolved during that time". It added with "sustained commitment over the next three to five years", Devonport "has the potential to move to a routine attention position". Peter Burt, of the Nuclear Information Service, said: "The nuclear safety improvements required at Devonport have not been completed within the expected two year timescale, and we will apparently have to wait for several more years before the situation improves. "Babcock is clearly unable to deliver the improvements it is being paid to complete. It is time for the MoD to cancel the current management contract for the dockyard and bring the site under the control of a new, competent management team." Source: MoD Babcock said in a statement: "The continued safety of our operations at Devonport remains the highest priority. "We have developed a comprehensive long term safety improvement programme to address the points raised by ONR. That work is progressing to plan and has the full visibility of the regulators." The Ministry of Defence said: "Safety at HM Naval Base Devonport, as with all Ministry of Defence sites, is of paramount importance. "The MoD supports Babcock's commitment to address the issues raised in the report, and we continue to work together to deliver the necessary investments at Devonport, which includes a site-wide nuclear safety programme with sustained commitment over the coming years."	The UK's nuclear submarine refit base is to remain in special measures amid safety concerns.
Police have been searching the site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, for five weeks. Despite a high-profile missing persons campaign, it is thought by police he ended up in a bin lorry. Mr Mckeague's father Martin said it was "breathtaking" to see how much waste officers have combed through. LIVE: Updates on this story and other Suffolk news He has been to the site five times and is staying in a nearby campsite with his wife Trish. "It's heartbreaking to think when you are there Corrie could be under foot," he said. "Everything leads to Corrie being there and when I'm looking at and watching these guys rake through, I know the police wouldn't be here going through all these tonnes of rubbish if they didn't expect Corrie to be there." Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline in Fife, vanished while on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September. He was last seen on CCTV at about 03:25 BST. A bin lorry collected refuse a short time later from the area the RAF Honington gunner was last seen. Suffolk Police said officers were trawling through 60 tonnes a day at the site in Milton, near Cambridge. The search is now in its fifth week and is expected to take up to 10.	The father of missing airman Corrie Mckeague, who is camping near a landfill site as police search for a body, said it is "heartbreaking" to think his son is buried there.
The 35-year-old ex-England batsman, who made his highest Twenty20 score with 115 not out from 66 balls on Wednesday, hit seven sixes in 100 from 45 balls. It took Durban-based Dolphins to their 168 target as they beat the Knights by nine wickets with 20 balls to spare. Pietersen will appear in two more games for the Dolphins before heading to Australia for the Big Bash League. The South Africa-born batsman last played for England in the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash in Australia and was told in March that year that he was not part of England's future plans. Meanwhile, there was a new Twenty20 world record in New Zealand as former Kiwi opening batsman Peter Fulton claimed five outfield catches for his Canterbury province against Northern Districts in their domestic Super Smash T20 league. Listen to BBC World Service's Stumped programme, featuring an interview with Kevin Pietersen.	Kevin Pietersen smashed a second successive unbeaten hundred in South Africa's Ram Slam T20 event.
Media playback is not supported on this device Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. "Some of the comments went too far," Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. "If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to," he said. Haye added he now has a "different kind of respect" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. "When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring," he said. "When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way." Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing "irreparable damage" to his ankle and foot. "It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap," he said. "I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. "I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. "I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short." Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch "solely depends on Tony" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. "I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody," he said. "Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. "Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. "For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion."	David Haye expects a fine from the British Boxing Board of Control for his comments in the build-up to Saturday's defeat by Tony Bellew.
In the article on Lena Dunham's site Lenny, she said: "I'm over trying to find the 'adorable' way to state my opinion and still be likable!" She said she only found how much less she was being paid when emails from Sony Pictures were hacked last year. "I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early," she said. Sony's internal computer system was hacked in November. The leaked emails started making headlines soon afterwards. One of the biggest stories involved emails from Sony boss Amy Pascal that revealed Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams were paid much less than their American Hustle co-stars. In her essay, The Hunger Games actress went into more detail about her reasons for not fighting for more money. "I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled'. "At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realised every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled'." She also opened up about how she is treated as a woman in Hollywood. "All I hear and see all day are men speaking their opinions, and I give mine in the same exact manner, and you would have thought I had said something offensive," she said. "I'm over trying to find the "adorable" way to state my opinion and still be likable!" Last week, Meryl Streep - one of Hollywood's most successful actors - spoke out about sexism in the film industry, saying that even she receives less pay than male co-stars. Streep was talking to the BBC ahead of the London premiere of her film, Suffragette, about the militant campaign in support of women's voting rights in the UK. Suffragette opened the London Film Festival which is also held a global symposium on gender in the media with Oscar-winning actress Geena Davis. At the symposium Davis called for more women on screen and more challenging female roles in TV and film. "We are unwittingly training generation after generation to see men and women as unequal," said Davis who was speaking on gender in media in London. "Surely in the 21st century we should be showing kids that boys and girls should be sharing the sandbox equally?" Earlier this year Davis launched a Hollywood film festival to both highlight the problem and showcase the work of female talent in the industry. In one hacked Sony email, actress and director Angelina Jolie was referred to as a "spoiled brat". Lawrence ended her post by saying that, after her experience, she wasn't surprised. "For some reason, I just can't picture someone saying that about a man."	Jennifer Lawrence has written an essay expressing her anger at getting paid less than her male co-stars.
Max Jowitt crossed early on after good work by Craig Hall, but three quick tries by Tony Gigot, Dave Taylor and Justin Horo put the hosts in control. Wakefield drew level at 18-18 at the break when Jonny Molloy powered over and Hall touched down. The teams both scored two further tries but Pat Richards missed a late kick with his side trailing by two at 30-28. And Wakefield, who were already assured of their place in the top eight, held on for a victory which ends a three-match losing run. The Wildcats had regained the lead after an even first period when Bill Tupou made the most of some quick thinking by Hall to go over. Catalans responded again when Morgan Escare ran onto a Lucas Albert kick. Mikey Sio then crossed for the visitors and the reliable boot of Liam Finn made it 30-24, but although Fouad Yayha scored in the corner, Richards' missed conversion proved costly for Catalans. Catalans Dragons: Escare, Yaha, Garcia, Duport, Richards, Gigot, Albert, Baitieri, Taylor, Horo, Maria, Pelissier, Casty. Substitutes: Bousquet, Da Costa, Mason, Navarrete. Wakefield: Jowitt, Lyne, Arundel, B Tupou, Hall, Miller, Finn, Simon, Moore, Arona, Ashurst, Molloy, Sio. Substitutes: Scruton, A Tupou, Walton, Fifita. Att: 8,562. Ref: Chris Campbell (RFL).	Wakefield moved up to sixth in Super League after edging a thrilling topsy-turvy encounter with Catalans Dragons.
The collision, which involved a silver Porsche and a grey Toyota Hilux, happened on the B976 Birse to Finzean road at 19:12 on Saturday. The 30-year-old driver of the Porsche was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The driver of the pick-up was uninjured. Sergeant Rob Warnock, from the Aberdeenshire and Moray Road Policing Unit, said: "Inquiries into the circumstances of the incident are at an early stage and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the silver Porsche or the Toyota Hilux prior to the incident to contact the police.''	A man is being treated for life threatening injuries after his car was involved in a crash with a pick-up truck in Aberdeenshire.
Anders Behring Breivik complained in a letter to the prison service that his coffee is served cold, he does not have enough butter for his bread, and he is not allowed moisturiser. Breivik is serving a minimum 21-year sentence for the bombings and shootings in Oslo and Utoeya island last July. The Norwegian authorities have not commented on the letter. However his lawyer has confirmed that the details of the 27-page document leaked to Norway's VG newspaper are authentic. Breivik is being held in almost complete isolation - 23 hours a day, he says - at Ila prison outside Oslo. His cell includes three sections, one to sleep, one for study and a third for exercise - each measuring 8 sq m (86 sq ft). In the letter, he complains that the cell is poorly decorated and has no view. "I highly doubt that there are worse detention facilities in Norway," he writes. 'Too cold' Among his other complaints are: Ila is an all-male institution which "houses some of the country's most dangerous men", its website says. However it differs markedly from other maximum security jails in western Europe. The staff is a half-and-half mix of men and women and none are armed. Breivik massacred 77 people, most of them teenagers at a youth camp run by Norway's governing Labour Party. His 21-year sentence can be indefinitely extended for as long as he is considered a danger to society.	The Norwegian convicted of the massacre of 77 people last year has said he is being held in "inhumane" conditions.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
Morgan-Smith was available on a free transfer after he was released by the Latics, having made only four starts for the League One club this season. The 26-year-old has previously had spells with Stockport County, Luton, Macclesfield and Kidderminster. "I want to try and get this club back into the Football League where they should be," he told the club's website.	Relegated Cheltenham Town have signed former Oldham striker Amari Morgan-Smith on a one-year deal.
Welshman Chaz Davies won the race as Northern Ireland's Rea, 29, secured an unassailable 55-point lead going into the final race of 2016 on Sunday. England's Tom Sykes, who needed to win and for team-mate Rea to finish outside the top 14, finished fourth. "I'm so, so happy. The job's done and the target is achieved," said Rea. "It will take some time to sink in but I know we have done a wonderful job." He told Eurosport: "We started the season so strong that we were able to manage the last few races. "I gave 200% in that race and threw caution to the wind but it was not enough to win." Rea, who came into the final round with a 48-point advantage over Sykes, produced another assured performance. The Co Antrim man started on pole but Davies was soon out in front with Rea close behind. Sykes was well back in fifth and the race became a two-way battle with Rea pushing Davies until the closing laps. Davies continued his recent dominance by pulling clear and winning by almost four seconds from Rea with Sylvain Guintoli completing the podium. Ducati rider Davies has won six of the past seven races and is only seven points behind Sykes.	Jonathan Rea has become the first rider since Carl Fogarty in 1999 to win successive World Superbikes titles as he finished second in Qatar.
Richard Gray, 36, admitted intending to cause fear of violence with the fake firearm near Heene and St Mary's Primary Schools on 8 May. He also admitted possessing a knife in Worthing's Victoria Park. Gray, of Cortis Avenue, was sentenced at Crawley Magistrates' Court to eight weeks in prison for each offence, to run concurrently.	A man has been jailed for trying to scare people with an imitation gun near two Worthing schools.
Oxfordshire County Council said two independent studies found having one organisation to run all services could save £100m over five years. But the plan is opposed by the county's five district councils, who have argued in favour of three councils instead. All the authorities have been criticised for engaging in a "turf war" over their rival devolution plans. County council leader Ian Hudspeth said public money should be spent on providing services, rather than running "six separate organisations". The district councils have argued the county needs an elected mayor, rather than fewer councillors, to get more money from Whitehall. Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said the county's plan was "the wrong proposal at the wrong time". He added: "For the people of Oxford, a unitary council would be a disaster. "The needs of a multi-ethnic and socially mixed urban community are very different to the more rural parts of the county." Leader of West Oxfordshire District Council James Mills said the aim of the district councils' devolution bid was to get more money from central government. He said: "A mayor gives a strong voice to Oxford, single point of contact to government and is accountable to the people of Oxfordshire." But Mr Hudspeth said the proposal was needed because the county council "cannot continue to make savings without further cuts to local services". He said: "One council for Oxfordshire would be more efficient and simpler for residents, with one phone number, one website and one point of contact." Residents are being asked for their views before the final proposal is considered by the county council's cabinet on 14 March.	A proposal to abolish six councils and create one county-wide local authority for Oxfordshire has been published.
The 44-year-old will work alongside Andy Hessenthaler, who was appointed as Orient boss last week. Former Southend, Birmingham and Peterborough defender Edwards joined the east London outfit in 2009 and has been coaching in the club's academy. He assisted with first-team affairs at the end of last season while Hessenthaler was in caretaker charge.	League Two club Leyton Orient have appointed Andy Edwards as assistant manager.
The airport is in competition with Heathrow to win approval for an additional runway. One of the guarantees is compensation for people living close to the airport. Gatwick's chairman Sir Roy McNulty said: "These guarantees would mean Gatwick takes on the main risks of building the new runway." The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England and is due to publish its findings in the summer. These options are a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick. Gatwick has "guaranteed" the project would be privately funded with no need for public subsidy, that airport charges would be capped and it would bear the main risks of the expansion plan. It has also promised to compensate residents by Â£1,000 towards council tax bills if they are affected by significant level of aircraft noise, and said it would ensure that air quality targets always were always met.	Bosses at Gatwick Airport have unveiled five "guarantees" they hope will convince the Airports Commission to approve a second runway.
Across the UK there were 96,910 residential transactions in June, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. That is a fall of 3.3% on May's number, and the lowest total since October 2016. The figures, from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), represent a small annual rise, up 1% in comparison with June 2016. However, last summer's sales were depressed by the introduction of additional stamp duty rates in April. It is also the first time this year that the number of transactions has fallen below 100,000 a month. Property experts think the figures give a more accurate indication of the health of the market than house prices. "These figures are disappointing as we would have expected them to be much higher bearing in mind the turmoil in the market this time last year following the introduction of the stamp duty surcharge," said Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent. Where can I afford to live?	The number of homes being bought and sold has fallen for the third month in a row, according to government figures.
The 21-year-old made his debut for the Tigers in the League Cup first-round tie against Accrington Stanley in August. Dixon was captain of the Championship club's under-21 side.

League Two side York City have signed Hull City midfielder Matt Dixon on an 18-month deal.
Houses at Auvers II was hung in the Picnic Cafe on Friday to launch the Open for Art weekend festival. David Brooks, from Toronto, Canada, has been a van Gogh specialist for 18 years and claims it is not genuine. Owner Mark Lawrence insists it is a real van Gogh, but admits it has not yet been authenticated. Mr Brooks, who the Van Gogh Museum said "owns the largest van Gogh website in the world", told the BBC it was not a known work by the artist. "To me it screams 'not van Gogh'," he said, adding: "It's not well executed, the style is quite poor." The Van Gogh Museum, in Amsterdam, is the only place that can officially authenticate a van Gogh work. Mr Lawrence said he had been working with the museum to get the painting researched since the beginning of the year. The museum said it had received an email from Mr Lawrence on Monday, and had advised him to send a request for research along with a photograph of the painting. It added an investigation could take weeks or sometimes months, depending on the type of inquiry required. Mr Lawrence said: "We are doing everything that would normally be done to get it authenticated." In relation to Mr Brooks' comments, he said: "It can't be fully authenticated simply from looking at a photograph, it has to be tested." He also said it was possible the painting had areas of over-paint from restoration which "covers up some of the details". "There's a lot of heavy cracking on our painting too which is commonly found in van Gogh work particularly ones he painted thickly, and it also has a protective thick varnish on it," he added. Mr Lawrence previously said he inherited the painting from his grandfather who died in 1980, along with 200 other paintings. The 27-year-old director of the web-based Reading Gallery is looking for a permanent home for his collection, which is currently in storage and is said to include works by Rembrandt, Picasso, and Dali. He said House at Auvers II was bought in the 1920s by his great-grandfather for 300 francs in Paris, and added it was not known to the art world because it had been in his family since before van Gogh's works were first catalogued in the 1930s.	Doubt has been raised over the authenticity of a painting purported to be by Vincent van Gogh which was displayed in a Reading cafe.
Danny McKay, 36, was shot dead at his home on Longlands Road in Newtownabbey last Thursday at 20:30 BST. Before the murder, five masked men entered a house at Dunore Court in Belfast's New Lodge and forced the occupant to hand over his VW Bora. At 20:50 BST the VW was found burnt-out in Ardmoulin Place in the Falls. Police believe the incidents are linked. Detectives from the PSNI's serious crime branch, working with uniformed officers, returned to all three locations on Thursday to talk to local people and passers-by. The officer leading the investigation, DCI John McVea, said: "We have made a number of arrests but this investigation will continue for some time. This was a brutal murder and we are asking for people's assistance." He said they were also keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a dark coloured saloon car "being driven in a suspicious manner" in the Longlands area in the days before the murder. "Our final appeal is about a man with a light-coloured top seen running away from the burning car at Ardmoulin Place. If you can provide information about this, we need to hear from you," he added. A 25-year-old man was arrested by police on Thursday morning in north Belfast and is being questioned about the murder at Antrim police station. A number of other people arrested in connection with the killing have been released.	Police investigating the murder of a Newtownabbey man have re-visited three scenes connected to the killing.
The 29-year-old finished 11th in the -94kg class for Armenia, where he was born, but has since switched to represent the United States. A retest of his 2012 sample revealed the presence of a steroid. A total of 43 weightlifters have now failed retests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. Six more competitors from Vardanian's event at the London Olympics are already facing disqualification after retests found steroids. Vardanian was previously banned for six months in 2009 after testing positive for cannabis.	American weightlifter Norik Vardanian has tested positive for a banned substance in a sample he gave while competing for Armenia at London 2012.
It is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPim). The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case. TPims replaced control orders in January 2012. The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March. The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim. The Home Office said: "We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable." Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Labour has argued that TPims have "weakened" public protection against terrorism. In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only. The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order. The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station. BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons. The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing. The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim. A trial date was not set.	A suspected terrorist has been charged with breaching conditions imposed as part of the government's new terror monitoring powers.
Susan O'Brien QC has said those giving evidence must have experienced abuse no later than 17 December 2014. Furthermore, the QC wants any group which wants to express how the inquiry should proceed to make their views known by 31 January next year. Survivors' groups have previously criticised a lack of progress in the work of the Scottish inquiry. The probe - established in October after its initial announcement in December, 2014 - will cover abuse within living memory up to 17 December, 2014. It will examine abuse of children in care and the effects of abuse on children and their families. The inquiry will also examine the extent of failures of bodies with legal responsibility to protect children in care, whether such failures have been addressed, and if further changes are needed. Ms O'Brien said: "We are developing procedures to take the evidence of survivors, as it is likely that many individuals will apply to give us their testimony. "We are considering how best to assess the evidence from victims/survivors and all the other evidence the inquiry receives. We also require to determine which of the witnesses will remain anonymous." The inquiry will have statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. It will also examine any instance where a child was abused at institutions including residential care provided by faith-based organisations, children's homes, secure care and those placed in foster care.	The chairwoman of the inquiry into historical child abuse has announced two key dates for the investigation.
North Wales Police said the incident involved just one vehicle on the B5111 in Coedana, Llanerchymedd at about 17:30 BST. The road has been closed and diversions are in place. Two police officers are being treated for minor injuries at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.	A police car has crashed while responding to an emergency call on Anglesey.
The most important ground floor rooms in the stately home are to be restored, while the upper floors are to be used for exhibitions and events. The principal rooms are to be recreated as they were in the 18th Century. The 8th Earl of Onslow, whose family rebuilt the house in the 1720s, has said it should remain a ruin. The Palladian mansion near Guildford was bequeathed to the NT in 1956 by the Onslow family. About 95% of the Grade I-listed house, which featured in the 2008 film The Duchess starring Keira Knightley, was damaged. The trust said it was confident a number of principal rooms on the ground floor, including the Marble Hall, Speakers' Parlour and Saloon, could be restored. A spokesman said: "The fact that so many features survived and items from the rooms are being recovered from the ashes made the case for restoration compelling. "The enduring significance of the architect Leoni's original designs means it will go back instead to look at the 18th Century decorative schemes and layout of the house." The trust said the upper floors were "less architecturally significant" and had already been altered since the house was first built. Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said: "The fire at Clandon was shocking, but gives us the opportunity not only to show our respect for the heritage of the past, but also to create new heritage for the future. "The loss of so many of the contents of the house means that we cannot return it to how it looked the day before the fire. "However, we now know more about the original layout and recognise that the enduring significance of the house is its architecture." The trust said it had looked at a number of options for the house to ensure Clandon Park remained open and accessible to the public. A spokesman said the cost of the work was expected to be met largely through the trust's insurance policy, although it would also be asking supporters for donations.

UKIP, which won May's election, spent £2,956,737, while the Tories' campaign expenditure was £2,980,815, The Lib Dems spent £1,580,575 and lost all but one of their MEPs - Labour, which came second, spent £1,027,339. The figures cover the campaign period from 23 January to polling day, 22 May. UKIP's campaign spending works out at 68p for each of their 4,376,635 votes. For Labour it is 26p per vote, the Conservatives 79p and the Lib Dems, who lost 11 of their 12 MEPs, £1.45. The Green Party, which came fourth, spent £534,249 on its campaign - 43p for each of its 1,255,573 votes. Including the SNP's £267,372, the six highest-spending parties spent a total of £9,347,087 on campaigning, the Electoral Commission said. All but Labour spent more than they did during the 2009 European election campaign.	The UK Independence Party spent almost as much as the Conservatives at this year's European elections - while the Lib Dems outspent Labour, Electoral Commission figures show.
The day before saw a strike ballot on career progression with the part-time Night Tube drivers and a dispute over a "breakdown in industrial relations" with maintenance workers. Why? Well it seems that industrial relations are being redrawn. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would bring in a more constructive relationship with the unions. He also promised "zero strikes". That didn't happen. But I know for a fact the mayor, the transport commissioner, the TSSA and the RMT unions have met - that is in stark contrast to the previous administration. However, with this new relationship there are now new tensions. Transport bosses seem bemused the unions are upset over the relocation over eight drivers from Essex depots to Earl's Court. They claim it is in black and white in the contracts agreed by the unions themselves. They have quoted the contract: "Your normal work location will be Leytonstone Train Crew depot Central Line. "[London Underground Ltd] will endeavour to allocate you to an operating location convenient to you, but reserves the right to require you to work at any place it may from time to time determine within the area served by [London Underground Ltd] and London Bus Services." Bosses also say the new Night Tube contracts (agreed by the unions) set out that drivers must stay in their new positions for 18 months. I put it to Peter McNaught - an Operations Director at London Underground - that this was meant to be a new era of friendlier industrial relations. "I don't know," he replied. "This one and the dispute that's just been announced on Night Tube, these are long standing agreements we have with the trade unions. "The ink is still wet on the Night Tube agreement. The unions signed up to it and now we're in dispute about something they only agreed to five months ago." "I think it goes beyond London Underground and what we're doing. It's quite strange." The unions are clearly empowered by the new relationship. They think the extra 325 staff agreed after the recent strikes over the station staff closures was a victory and are now pushing to achieve more for their members. I asked John Leach from the RMT if he felt his union was now trying it on under the new mayor. He said: "I think it's the opposite. "There is a disconnect between the senior management and their superior people at City Hall in my opinion. "We're hearing that we should have better industrial relations and then when we talk to management we're up against the same old, same old." Redrawing industrial relations is not straight forward. It could be a bumpy road ahead. And the worry for commuters is it could come at a cost.	Yesterday there was a strike over driver relocation on the Central Line.
A team from Glasgow University found there was a sharp fall in accidents from 5,901 in 1997 to 2,914 in 2014. The researchers said, however, there was "no evidence" the M74 had impacted on an "already decreasing trend". The five-mile (8km) route, which cost Â£692m, links the M74 at Carmyle to the M8 southwest of the Kingston Bridge. Planning permission for the route was granted in October 1995 and immediately opposed by Joint Action Against the M74 (Jam74) - a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups. Construction began in 2008 after a last-ditch legal bid to halt the project was abandoned by Friends of the Earth Scotland and Jam74. Supporters claimed the road would bring economic benefits to the west of Scotland and help cut accidents, whereas critics argued it would cause more pollution, increase health problems and fragment communities. The Glasgow University study looked to evaluate the impact of the M74 extension on the number of road accidents on local roads during the construction period and following its opening. Lead author of the report, Dr Jonathan Olsen, said: "The building of the M74 extension in the south of Glasgow was controversial. There were strong arguments for and against its construction, but ultimately it went ahead. "One of the arguments in favour was that it could reduce road accidents on local streets. "In our study we examined police accident data from 1997 to 2014, three years after the new motorway was opened, and found that this predicted reduction in road accident numbers had not materialised." He added: "But on the other hand, we found no evidence that the M74 extension had led to an increase in accidents." Report co-author, Professor Rich Mitchell, added: "There is surprisingly little evidence about the impacts new motorways have. "This research will be useful for planners, politicians and residents elsewhere who are trying to decide whether to build or not." The study is published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.	The controversial M74 extension through Glasgow has had little impact on road traffic accidents in the city since it opened in 2011, a new study has found.
Omar Khan, 31, had worked at The Johnson Partnership in Nottingham for five years before he was arrested. Erlin Manahasa, Albert Dibra and Nazaquat Ali joined Khan in admitting the same charge, between 1 October  and 4 December last year, at Nottingham Crown Court. They are due to be sentenced on 15 April. Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire The court heard the case involved the recovery of 1kg (2.2lb) of cocaine. Digby Johnson, a partner at the Johnson firm, confirmed they did not represent Khan - who had set up his own office and was set to leave the company. "I still find it hard to believe he could do something as stupid as involve himself in drugs and people who were heavily involved in drugs," Mr Johnson said. "I'm just at a loss. You do question everything you've ever believed about anybody." Mr Johnson also described Khan, of William Street, Huddersfield, as a "lovely guy" who was "incredibly hard-working". "He would put in hour after hour," he added. "He was keen to progress and impress." Khan appeared at the court via video link to admit conspiracy to supply the Class A drug. Manahasa, of no fixed address, Dibra, of Joyce Avenue, Nottingham, and Ali, of Chard Street, Nottingham, were remanded in custody following the hearing.	A barrister who was due to move into his own chambers in Huddersfield has pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine.
As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food. In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years. She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health. Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma. When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks. During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud. It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers. Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day. One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices. Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state. "I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years," she said. "Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health. "I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume. "I feel so much better and intend to keep this up." The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing. A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology. Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks. Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients. This has to change. Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up. When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term. But, this can actually make things worse in the long term. The food you are eating is literally "shocking" your body. By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks. She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress. It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health. Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional. There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood. As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you: 1. Reduce sugar and processed foods Sugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise. Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall. At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel "h-angry" as well - hungry and angry. Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. This can have a negative impact on your mood. 2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables. 3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter. Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood. 4. Feed your gut bugs Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers. It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis. The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut. Best options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate. See how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.	Approximately one in four of us will experience a mental health problem each year in England.
A Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman said camping gear had been found and distress signals heard from the group's avalanche beacons. She said there was little chance for survival. The group, from Seattle's Alpine Ascents International, was last heard from on Wednesday. There were two guides and four clients in the party, which began a five-day expedition last Monday. The park spokeswoman, Fawn Bauer, told Reuters the camping gear was found more than 3,000ft (900m) below the group's last known position and the group may have been caught in an avalanche. "We don't believe there was a viable chance for survival," she said. The search effort has been suspended. Ms Bauer said: "It would expose our rangers to pretty extreme conditions, so we are not able to do any kind of ground searching of that area. And, in all honesty, we may never be able to get on the ground there." The last contact was via satellite phone on Wednesday at an elevation of 12,800ft. At that time a rain system was sweeping through. When the party failed to return on Friday a helicopter was despatched. Mount Rainier stands at 14,410ft and attracts thousands of climbers each year.	Hopes are fading for six climbers who have gone missing on Mount Rainier in the north-western US state of Washington.
Michael Tovey, 27, formerly of Lakes Road, Erdington, Birmingham is accused of using two drones to fly contraband into HMP Birmingham last year. In the first charges of their type brought by West Midlands Police, Mr Tovey faces 13 counts of conveying banned items into a prison. He is set to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 7 June. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Tovey is accused of using two drones to drop contraband into the prison's exercise yard on 29 October and 6 November. He attempted to drop a consignment near N and P wings containing four phones, SIM cards, Black Mamba, steroids and cannabis, it is alleged. It is claimed he was also responsible for a drone that crashed into the same yard eight days later, carrying two phones and further quantities of the same banned drugs.	A man has been charged with using drones to smuggle cannabis, steroids and mobile phones into prison.
His lecture, to be broadcast later this year, is part of a raft of new BBC Radio 4 programmes unveiled on Monday. They include Glenda Jackson's return to acting, in a drama based on a cycle of 20 novels by French writer Emile Zola, and a Late Night Woman's Hour. Also announced is that Miles Jupp is to take over as the new host of BBC Radio 4's comedy show The News Quiz. Prof Hawking said he hoped his lecture would "encourage people to imagine and explore the possibilities of science - both the known, and the as yet unknown". He will also answer some questions sent in by listeners ahead of the recording. "I will describe the remarkable properties of black holes, including the fact that very small black holes aren't black at all, but glow like hot bodies," he said. "We should never stop trying to tell these extraordinary stories from science, and I hope my Reith Lecture will enthuse a new generation to develop ideas that will have an impact on our understanding of the world and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery." The BBC Reith Lectures began in 1948, with a talk by philosopher Bertrand Russell. Last year, surgeon Atul Gawande examined the future of medicine. Past lecturers include artist Grayson Perry, politician Aung San Suu Kyi and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Prof Hawking's lecture coincides with BBC Radio 4's plans to mark the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. BBC Radio 4 controller Gwyneth Williams, who announced the new season along with BBC director general Tony Hall, said: "I know that our discriminating audience will be inspired by Prof Hawking's magnificent challenge "never to stop trying to tellâ€¦ extraordinary stories from scienceâ€¦ and never to be overwhelmed by the task of discovery'." The rest of the season includes: Double Oscar winner Glenda Jackson's return to acting after more than two decades in politics comes in an adaptation of Emile Zola's 20-volume novel series Les Rougon-Macquart. Entitled Blood, Sex And Money, the series is described as "a multi-stranded immersive experience that draws us into 19th Century France". There will be three seasons, broadcast at six-monthly intervals, with the first beginning on 21 November. Jackson is cast as 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque alongside Robert Lindsay, Georgina Campbell, Fenella Woolgar and Ian Hart. Late Night Woman's Hour sees Lauren Laverne join the Woman's Hour team in August for a special series containing "mischievous and unbridled" conversation, during which she will share presenting duties with Jane Garvey. Woman's Hour will continue in its regular slot.	Prof Stephen Hawking is to present this year's BBC Reith Lecture, with a talk on black holes.
The initial estimate showed growth picking up from the first quarter of the year, when it was 0.2%. The ONS said the growth was driven by services, particularly retail, which more than offset falls in output in the manufacturing and construction sectors. It added there had been a "notable slowdown" in growth from last year. However, the figure for the second quarter was in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said the rise in growth was unlikely to change expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current record low next week. ONS head of national accounts Darren Morgan said: "The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year." Film production in the UK, plus box-office receipts from cinemas, was one of the best performing parts of the economy during the period. "While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth," Mr Morgan said. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for UK economic growth this year because of the weak first-quarter figure. The IMF said it expects UK GDP to grow by 1.7% instead of its previous projection of 2%. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK economy had now grown consistently for four-and-a-half years. "We can be proud of that, but we are not complacent," he added. "We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country." Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "Today's GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. "Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices." Aberdeen Asset Management chief economist Lucy O'Carroll said: "This pick-up will be taken as good news, but it really doesn't amount to much. "The figures are the first estimate of growth, based on very patchy data. They always get revised over time, and often substantially so. "It's the underlying trends that matter. They don't look favourable at the moment, given the uncertainties around Brexit and the pressure on household budgets from higher inflation."	The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to June, driven in part by a booming film industry, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The table, published in a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, showed that US invested more than $48bn (Â£30bn) in the sector, up from $34bn in 2010. China slipped to second place, the authors reported, with investment only increasing by $0.5bn to $45.5bn. Globally, overall financial backing in clean energy technologies hit a record $263bn, up 6.5% from 2010 levels. The report, Who is Winning the Clean Energy Race , showed that G20 nations accounted for 95% of the investment in the sector (which does not include nuclear power). The data, compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, ranked the UK as seventh in the world, with $9.4bn of investment in 2011. Over the course of the year, an additional 83.5 gigawatts (GW) was added to the world's clean energy generation capacity, including almost 30GW of solar and 43GW of wind. "The sector continues to expand and is outpacing growth in the overall (global) economy. The sector reached its trillionth dollar of investment last year," observed Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew's Clean Energy Program. "We now have 565GW of installed (generation) capacity around the world. That outstrips nuclear installed capacity by 47%. "So I think the facts fly in the face of those individuals who say this is a niche industry. This a growing and maturing sector." (December 2011; source: Pew/Bloomberg) She said market data showed that the US benefited in the short-term from attracting finances, however it was unlikely to be sustained. "Investors rushed in to take advantage of expiring policies, such as tax incentives, loan guarantees, which expired at the end of 2011," Ms Cuttino told BBC News. "So when we look at the very rapid rate of growth in investment here in the US, it is hard to see how that could be maintained without the policy mechanism that spurred that growth." She suggested that there were signs that pointed towards a "drop off" in future clean energy investment as a result of "policy uncertainty". China in previous years, on the other hand, had enjoyed rapid year-on-year growth, but it only recorded a $0.5bn increase during 2011. Ms Cuttino said this was probably a result of the sector within the country maturing. "The thing that is noticeable about China is that they are world leaders in terms of attracting asset finance, which is a measure of job creation and deploying renewables. "This means they are really reaping the rewards of attracting a certain class of investment. "They have a policy that not only attracts investment and deploys renewables, but actually manufacturers and exports as well. Ms Cuttino said that all eyes would be on the Chinese during the coming 12 months because it had increase it target for solar generating capacity from 20GW by 2020 to 50GW by 2020. "So it is going to be a good location for investment, as solar incentives decline in the US and Europe," she added.	The US has regained top spot from China as the biggest investor in clean energy in 2011, according to global rankings.
Donaldson, 41, moved to eight under par at Barseback Golf and Country Club to lead from Italy's Renato Paratore. Englishmen Graeme Storm and Max Orrin, who was tied for the lead on Thursday, are a stroke further back in Malmo. "I made some great escapes and the chipping and putting has been better," said Donaldson. "I've just got to keep doing the same things, don't think too far ahead about winning tournaments as yet because it's only two rounds in." Donaldson, who is looking for a fourth European Tour title, carded five birdies and just his first bogey of the week to take the lead. "I've been playing some nice golf and just not been able to put it all together, the first couple of days here I've been able to do that," added the world number 256. Orrin, who secured a rookie season on the European Tour via the qualifying school, had shared the overnight lead with Paratore, but the 23-year-old could only add a level-par 73 to his opening 68. He and 39-year-old Storm, who is seeking his second win of the season, are joined in tied third by France's Benjamin Hebert.	Wales' Jamie Donaldson will take a two-shot lead into the third round of the Nordea Masters after carding a second successive 69 on Friday.
The Welsh government has agreed to pay Â£20,000-a-year for three years for a site to store the 15th Century vessel discovered in 2002. It comes after Newport council said it planned to stop its funding due to budget cuts. The new site will allow freeze-drying of the ship's remaining timbers to continue, completing its conservation. Supporters of the Newport Ship raised concerns about its future in August when it emerged there was no plan in place for an alternative home after the lease on its current building expires in October. Council officers have since looked at six options, including relocating it to a National Museum of Wales facility in Nantgarw, storing it in a shared warehouse in Pill or at vacant council-owned premises. It also considered disposing of the timbers, but a report to councillors says that would leave the authority "accountable for the destruction of one of the most remarkable archaeological finds of the last 50 years". Instead the report recommends renting a warehouse to store the ship, which would be part funded with a grant offered by the Welsh government. This would allow freeze-drying of the ship's remaining untreated timbers to be completed and allow the public to visit it, as they do on open days held at its current home in Maeglas. It is hoped the Friends of Newport Ship, a charity which supports the conservation project, will eventually take over its management. The 500 year-old vessel was found on the banks of the River Usk during construction of the Riverfront theatre 12 years ago. Dating back to 1460, it is the most complete surviving example of a ship of its time and experts think it was used for trading along the Atlantic seaboard. It is thought it was built in south-west France, the Basque country or Portugal, but how it came to rest in Newport remains a mystery.	A new home could soon be found for Newport's medieval ship, safeguarding its future restoration.
Ian Paterson, 59, who appeared at the Court of Appeal via video link, was told his current sentence was "not sufficient" to reflect the seriousness and the totality of his offending. Paterson was found guilty in May at Nottingham Crown Court of 17 counts of wounding with intent. Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges. Explaining the decision to increase his jail term, one of the three Appeal Court judges - Lady Justice Hallett - told Paterson his victims had been, "left feeling violated and vulnerable". She described his treatment of patients as "brutal and sustained". "They have lost their trust in others, particularly some in the medical profession," she said. "Some have experienced long-term psychological effects."	A breast surgeon who intentionally wounded his patients has had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years.
Spanish police say he had secretly taken photographs of his students as well as having sent images of other children to people on the internet. The Manchester-born man reportedly had a "special obsession" with a girl he taught. He was arrested in Valladolid, north-west Spain as part of an Interpol investigation. Interpol said they discovered illegal files were being sent from an email address in Spain and alerted the authorities. Police said on Sunday the teacher is suspected of using a cloud storage service to keep and share the pictures between computers and with others. Officers say they found a large number of sexually explicit files involving minors at the home of the teacher. He kept photos of one girl in a dedicated folder on his computer but had not shared the images he had secretly taken of his underage students. Police said they believe he previously lived in the Seville area. Spanish National Police said: "At the moment, [police are] trying to establish the identity of the victims shown in the images found on the electronic devices belonging to the detained."	A British teacher living in Spain has been arrested for allegedly storing and sharing sexual images of children.
An airport spokesman said the runway had been closed for two periods on Sunday - of nine and five minutes - after the drone was sighted. Easyjet said four of its flights were diverted, while British Airways said one aircraft was diverted to Bournemouth. Other flights were put into holding patterns as a precaution. Sussex Police is investigating. The airport said: "Runway operations at Gatwick were suspended between 18:10 BST and 18:19, and again from 18:36 to 18:41, resulting in a small number of go-arounds and diverts." 12,500 ft Highest near miss, over Heathrow in February 2016 400ft Maximum height drones should fly 50 metres Closest drones are allowed to anyone or anything 70 Near misses involving drones in 2016, more than double the year before Craig Jenkins, who was flying with Easyjet from Naples, Italy, said: "We were crossing over the Channel and it [the plane] started circling. "It did four or five circles... before the captain said we were landing at Stansted. "First, they said Gatwick was closed because of an incident. Shortly after, they said it was a drone." Mr Jenkins, from Greenwich, south-east London, said passengers were given the choice of disembarking at Stansted or waiting an hour to fly back to Gatwick. Niamh Slatter, from Sussex, was flying from Valencia, Spain, when her BA flight was diverted to Bournemouth. "We were due to land 15 minutes early, but ended up circling over the south coast," she said. "Our attempted landing at Gatwick was aborted quite late as the drone had been spotted again, so we were told that the flight was being diverted to Bournemouth." Easyjet apologised for the inconvenience, saying the circumstances were "outside" of the firm's control. The UK Airprox Board monitors near-miss incidents. An Airprox is the official term for a situation where the distance between aircraft and their relative positions and speed were such that the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised. There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - more than double the number for 2015. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. The Civil Aviation Authority recommends drones be flown at no higher than 400ft. However, the highest Airprox involving a drone was at 12,500ft. Of the 142 Airprox incidents involving drones recorded since 2010, 40 of them were near to Heathrow. Six of them, up to May, had been near to Gatwick. In November 2016, the UK's drone code was revised and updated to help pilots ensure they fly the gadgets safely. The revised code turned the five main safety tips into a mnemonic, spelling drone, to make it easier to remember. UK revises safe flying drone code The British Airline Pilots' Association's flight safety specialist, Steve Landells, said the threat of drones flown near aircraft "must be addressed before we see a disaster". "We believe a collision, particularly with a helicopter, has the potential to be catastrophic," he said. The union has called for compulsory registration of drone users and said new technology should be considered, including a system where the drone transmits enough data for the police to track down the operator. The Civil Aviation Authority said there were serious consequences for people who broke the rules when flying drones. "Drone users have to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world. "[It is] a complex system that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft," a spokesman said. "It is totally unacceptable to fly drones close to airports and anyone flouting the rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment."	A drone flying close to Gatwick Airport led to the closure of the runway and forced five flights to be diverted.
Debra Milke was freed in September 2013 after a record of misconduct by a key detective in the case emerged. The case against Ms Milke rested largely on a purported confession to that detective. An appeals court in Arizona ruled on Thursday that the she could not be tried again in relation to the killing. Prosecutors had pushed for a retrial but a panel of three judges said such a move would amount to double jeopardy. The two men who carried out the killing remain on death row. Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head. The original trial in 1990 found Ms Milke guilty of arranging the killing, based largely on an alleged confession made to Detective Armando Saldate. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. "Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke," the court said. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial. The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. Ms Milke's ex-husband, Arizona Milke, remained convinced of her guilt. "She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty," he told the Associated Press. Lawyers for Ms Milke said they were "thrilled" at the decision not to allow a retrial. However, prosecutors can still appeal to the state's Supreme Court.	Charges have been dropped against a  US woman who spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of arranging her son's 1989 killing.

Frank Field, who is backing the Leave campaign, will say the 23 June poll poses "an untold danger" for his party's prospects of power. The vast majority of Labour MPs back EU membership. Meanwhile former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson will tell union members that EU membership is "vital" for workers' rights. The UK's EU vote: All you need to know Mr Field, the MP for Birkenhead and a former welfare minister, is expected to warn in a speech that the referendum could be "the second-longest suicide note in Labour's history" - behind the manifesto that preceded its 1983 general election drubbing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has expressed Eurosceptic views in the past, recently made his first major speech of the referendum campaign setting out a "socialist" vision for Britain in Europe. He said there was "nothing half-hearted" about Labour's campaign and said he would continue to make the case for membership in the run-up to polling day. But Mr Field will say: "The last thing Jeremy needs to do is to undermine further the traditional Labour vote, much of which wishes to leave the European Union. "For the party leader more actively to campaign for the Remain campaign will push even more Labour voters into the arms of UKIP." Mr Field, who campaigns for "balanced migration", will criticise an "open-door policy" which he says pushes down wages and puts a strain on public services. Ahead of the speech, Mr Field said Labour MPs' overwhelming support for staying in the EU was "very unrepresentative" of the views of many of the party's activists in the country at large. "While the polls show a majority of Labour voters support staying in Europe, about 40% do not and the number of MPs who represent that view are a mere handful," he told BBC Radio 4's Today. "It is our job to make a good case for leaving Europe so these voters feel that at last their views are being represented in the debate." The Leave campaign has targeted migration this week with interventions from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson as it attempted to regain the initiative following warnings about the economic effect of a vote to leave. Alan Johnson, who is leading his party's Remain campaign, will claim a vote to stay in the EU would be as important as the election of Labour's reforming government in 1945, which led to the creation of the NHS and expanded welfare. "From nurses and builders to railway workers, steel workers, postal workers and shop workers, trade unions will be campaigning for a Britain that remains in Europe," he will tell the Usdaw union's conference. "The rights of working people are protected by our EU membership, and Labour and our union movement are united in campaigning for Britain to remain in Europe." Elsewhere in the EU debate, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee published what it said was a "reliable, unbiased analysis" of the issues involved. The cross-party committee, which was divided on whether to back EU membership, said it had chosen not to endorse either side. Instead it urged voters to consider the UK's trading relationship with the rest of the EU and the rest of the world, its "international representation and reputation" and how the EU and its policies might develop in the future. Committee chairman Crispin Blunt said: "The referendum offers the British people a once-in-a-generation opportunity to chart a course for the UK's role in the world. "Voters should consider not only the short-term consequences of staying or leaving but the long-term opportunities and challenges."	Labour risks losing "a swathe" of voters to UKIP by campaigning to remain in the EU, one of its MPs is to warn.
The winning proposal will be "connected to" the University of Chicago, although the site has not been decided on yet, NBC in Chicago reports. The president was a law professor at the university and still has a home on the city's South Side. The library will store his papers and help frame his legacy as president. A formal announcement will be made the week after next, reports CBS. It says the president indicated he was leaning towards choosing his hometown in a recent phone call with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, once his closest adviser at the White House. Mr Obama met his wife, First Lady Michelle, when working at a law firm in the city in 1989. The losing cities also have strong connections to the Obama story - he grew up in Hawaii and attended Columbia University in New York. The other Chicago bid that completed the shortlist of four was from the University of Illinois. The 13 presidential libraries - spanning from Herbert Hoover to George W Bush - are administered by the US National Archives. Former President Bill Clinton's presidential library is in Little Rock and George W Bush has one at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas. All five living presidents gathered for the dedication of the Bush library in 2013, a ceremony that moved Mr Bush to tears.	Chicago has beaten New York City and Hawaii as the chosen location for President Barack Obama's library, according to US media.
In July, the authority earmarked £38m to the scheme as part of a package of works totalling more than £100m. Proposals include creating a dual carriageway, designated bus lane, as well as Witney to Oxford train and tram services. Up to 30,000 vehicles use the route between Oxford and Witney each day. Joe O'Connor, from Stanton Harcourt, said his commute to Oxford takes about 20 minutes "on a good day", but an accident on the A40 can lead to delays of up to two hours. "You have to give so much time to extra travelling which is horrendous," he said. "You should be able to regiment your time a little bit." Witney MP David Cameron described the A40 as "a bit of a foot on the windpipe of west Oxfordshire economy". He added he wanted to see a dual carriageway created along the route. As part of the strategy, Oxfordshire County Council said it wanted to improve travel times an "journey reliability" between Witney and Oxford, as well as "stimulate economic growth" and improve safety. Council leader Ian Hudspeth said long-term solutions would require "ambition and creativity". The public consultation closes on 8 November.	Views from members of the public on how best to solve congestion problems on the A40 in Oxfordshire are being sought by the county council.
It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club. Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m. Between them they now own more than 85% of the club. Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups. Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.	Red Bull has dismissed reports it is interested in buying West Ham, while the east London club's owners have told BBC Sport they are not looking for investors.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Stags dominated for long spells and had the best of the chances, but twice found themselves behind. For the second successive home game the Stags lost possession and were punished on the counter-attack as Jordan Slew ran onto the ball in his own half and raced clear on 14 minutes, leaving Jamie McGuire in his wake, and he slotted home across Brian Jensen and off the far post. It was their only effort of the half with Argyle keeper Luke McCormick by far the busier. He stopped a tame early Matt Green effort, tipped away a curling James Baxendale shot, made a fine block from Ashley Hemmings and watched a Mitch Rose blast sail over the bar. But Mansfield were level on 58 minutes as Green flicked on a Rose cross and Hemmings blasted home a rising shot under the far angle from the far post. Hemmings twice came close to another, firing just wide and hitting a post. But the Pilgrims, who have only lost once in 16 games snatched it as Slew fed Fox to fire home an excellent finish from 18 yards. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Campaigning in Edinburgh a day after her election, she said she had a mandate to change the party. She declined to say which of the four UK Labour leadership contenders she would vote for but said she would be "delighted" to work with any of them. She urged former supporters to give her a chance by listening to her arguments. "One of the first things I said when I was elected was that I'm not asking for people's vote straight away, I wouldn't be so presumptuous," she said. "I'm just asking for their ears, for a chance to be heard." Ms Dugdale was joined at The Meadows by shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray, Labour's only MP in Scotland, and Alex Rowley, the newly-elected deputy leader. Asked if she took any responsibility for Labour's loss of 40 Scottish MPs in May, the former deputy leader said: "I never shied away from taking my responsibility for what happened in the general election. "Party members who voted in the contest that concluded yesterday knew that - but I got 72% of the vote," she said. "That's a huge mandate to change the Labour party." The Lothians MSP refused  to be drawn on which of the UK Labour leadership contenders she supported. She said: "The message I can get across is to say that decisions about the Scottish Labour Party will be made here in Scotland and they will be made by me." Ms Dugdale comfortably saw off a challenge from fellow MSP Ken Macintosh for the leadership. Labour MSP Alex Rowley, a former aide to Gordon Brown, was elected as the party's new deputy leader.	New Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has promised she will decide the future direction of the party in Scotland.
Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane. About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips. The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme "Should we close our zoos?" "Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant," he told the BBC. "They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up." Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity. Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK. The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad. It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago. It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species. Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays. Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer. The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation. "[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments," said the president of Born Free, Will Travers. "A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide," he added. Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision. "They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree", he said.	A leading marketer of "responsible tourism" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.
Very occasionally tremors appear on the Zimbabwean political landscape that point to a shift in prospects for this rich but beleaguered southern African nation. For those of us who watch the changing fortunes of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe, the cautionary tale is always to expect the unexpected and to make no assumptions about the outcome. President Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party is riven with fresh divisions over who will succeed him - influential figures and names that once commanded entire chapters in the history of the nation's revolutions have been cast aside. For his part, the 92-year-old has long considered talk of a future in which he is absent as tantamount to treason. He is still the president and there is no vacancy for that post and the people, he says, should not be "confused by the confusionists". And for the last two years, his younger wife Grace has forced her will into the debate, seen one vice-president fired and is gunning for another while declaring just the other day that if needs be, Mr Mugabe would continue to rule from his grave. Hyperinflation and Zimbabwe's famous billion and trillion dollar notes are a thing of the past, but now hard currency has been in short supply. The liberalised dollar economy of 2009 is on the brink of collapse, there are long queues at banks which have limited the amounts people can withdraw  and there are plans to introduce new bond notes to ease the cash-flow crisis. Farai Sevenzo: "No inquiry, no arrests - just a $15bn hole in the nation's coffers" The country is importing more than it is selling, unemployment continues to soar, while a proud history of good education has only produced millions of vendors selling cheap goods and food to their fellow impoverished citizens as businesses fold around them. The country's major hospitals have at times gone without water and electricity, and it surprises no-one that the president's daughter gave birth in Singapore rather than a local maternity hospital; and that Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the official opposition, has been undergoing treatment in a South African hospital. The need for food is as real to millions as is the drought affecting all of southern Africa, and the politicians' preoccupation with the tragic soap opera of Mr Mugabe's last days on earth have offered no new plan to feed them and give them jobs. Instead, the headlines this year have celebrated his 92nd birthday, while he announced in March that $15bn (Â£10bn) of the country's diamond wealth had been looted and simply disappeared. No inquiry, no arrests - just a $15bn hole in the nation's coffers. In the context of this trying background, a 39-year-old pastor called Evan Mawarire, based in the capital, Harare, took to social media last month and called for Zimbabweans to re-own their flag, to stop wishing they lived in another country, and to force the politicians to answer questions on their lack of accountability and corrupt ways without fear. The hashtag #ThisFlag was born and internet-literate Zimbabweans within and outside the country began to air their frustrations, repeating the tag line "hatichada, hatichatya" - meaning in Shona "we've had enough, we are not afraid". They say they will refuse to bribe policemen, they will watch and circulate tales of corruption, they will not parrot the ruling party's excuses, which have for years blamed Western sanctions for dismal delivery of services and the ailing economy. Government loyalist ministers have dismissed the upstart #ThisFlag trend as an elitist diaspora-inspired movement that has been taking "to the Twitter", which would have no traction with the thousands of rural folk who have consistently voted President Mugabe back into power. Yet even as journalists reached for ill-matching Arab spring comparisons of revolution born out of social media, it was clear that a few hundred thousand citizens with access to smart phones had started a debate, which was not linked to a moribund opposition, whose loyalties were to the flag of nationhood rather than to the politics of personality. Zanu-PF elections have tended to be a united strategised persuasion of the electorate, which isolated the urban opposition and was not shy of violence and blatant bribery in money, maize or land. And a large proportion of the citizens kept their heads down and went about their business as activists disappeared and bones were broken. But the evidence of misrule is all around and if they can no longer afford to pay their children's school fees, they cannot afford to be apathetic. What is more, Zanu-PF's formidable united front is no more, everywhere you look former Mugabe loyalists are spouting the bitter language of opposition. Zimbabwe's next election is not due until 2018, but a "million man march" last week saw thousands of people on Harare's streets in a show of support for Mr Mugabe's candidature, while recent opposition marches in Harare and Bulawayo created a sea of red for the opposition Movement of Democratic Change (MDC). Only, it must be said, is the new party of Joice Mujuru, Mr Mugabe's sacked vice-president, shy of a protesting presence in the country. The starting gun for what is likely to be a game-changing election has been fired 18 months early. And it will be a vote in which citizen apathy may well be a thing of the past.

A person claiming to be in a vehicle on the A414 at North Weald, Essex, called police at 08:30 BST on Wednesday to say it had earlier been in Ashford in Kent. The lorry was found by Bedfordshire Police at Toddington Services, on the M1, in the afternoon. Six people are being held in custody. Supt Trevor Roe, from Essex Police, said it was a "positive outcome". "We've seen with human trafficking....the events could turn out to be very tragic so I think it was important we reacted fairly quickly across our neighbouring forces to try to locate the vehicle," he said.	Four suspected illegal immigrants are on the run after a lorry containing ten people was discovered by police following a "distress" call from one of the people inside.
Type 22s HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) expects to receive just under £3m from the sales agreed earlier this month. HMS Cornwall has been sold to Swansea Drydocks while the other three have been bought by Turkish firm Leyal. The two companies will recycle as many parts of the former Devonport-based ships as possible. Aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Invincible have also been sold to the Leyal yard in recent years. The four frigates were put up for sale in January with a preference for at least one of them to go to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. An MoD spokesman said: "We believe this deal represents value for money and a number of tenders were received both nationally and internationally. "Certain aspects of the ships' equipment will be recycled for use on other vessels and we have tried to be as economical with the disposal as possible." Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, had hoped one of the frigates could have been sunk and turned into a diving attraction but bids in that field were rejected. The ships are expected to leave Portsmouth in the autumn.	Four decommissioned Royal Navy frigates are destined for the scrapyard, the BBC has learned.
Rashan Charles, 20, was wrestled to the ground in Dalston, east London, on 22 July, and died about an hour later. On Friday, clashes broke out in Hackney as protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. A spokesman for Mr Charles's family said they understood the anger but called for "dignified" protest. "Burning down homes will not give justice," he said. Mr Charles was pursued by officers and became ill after trying to swallow an object, the Met has said. He died soon after in hospital. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating. Police warned that anyone using Mr Charles's death "as an excuse to commit crime" would be "dealt with robustly". Appealing for calm, family spokesman Stafford Scott said: "We understand your frustration, we understand your anger - don't feel that the family doesn't feel the anger and the frustration too. "But what the family knows is taking it to the streets doesn't give you justice. "Burning down your own homes, burning down your neighbourhood is not going to give you justice." Mr Scott, who runs race advocacy group Tottenham Rights, said black people had historically found it difficult "to win the hearts and minds of people". "We get no empathy, we get no sympathy. But this case is different - for once we've got the evidence. "For once we're not relying on the IPCC or the police to gather the evidence. The world has seen it and will feel it if we don't get justice." He added the family needed to "fight this properly" and had sought the best legal support. Mr Scott said the family asked the community "to support them in their struggle, to be dignified when they expect us to be wild". Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott told the protest she supported Mr Charles's parents and would not rest until questions were answered. In an earlier statement, the shadow home secretary said: "The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. "But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful." The anger of the protesters is clear. Many chanted "Justice for Rashan", clutching pictures of him along with their placards. Some confronted the police officers there to keep an eye on the demonstration, demanding answers. There were none forthcoming. That's because the investigation is now in the hands of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It will be their job to determine exactly what happened. Some campaigners, though, say there are too many of these investigations, too many lives being lost. They feel that their voices are too often not heard. There was much talk of the CCTV footage that captured the moment Rashan Charles was restrained. That has been pored over frame by frame, with many different interpretations of what happened, and many questions raised by it. Despite the anger, the vigil passed off peacefully, but the campaigners say they will not be silenced. They left though with the words of the family ringing in their ears: "We want peace on the streets." On Friday evening, demonstrators blocked part of Kingsland Road. At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackney tweeted: "Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted." The Met Police has since said that the violence that erupted on Friday night was "separate" from a peaceful protest that was held earlier in the day. Det Supt Claire Crawley said: "Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but there was inconvenience to local residents and road users and damage caused to vehicles, a cash machine and a number of windows. "We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated."	The family of a black man who died after being apprehended by police has appealed for peace after violent protests in the wake of his death.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Blues lead the top flight with 59 points with 14 games remaining. Second-placed Tottenham lead the chasing pack with 50 points, and just five points separate them in second and Manchester United in sixth. "I think there are six teams who are very strong and can fight to win the title," said Conte. Third-placed Manchester City, Arsenal, in fourth, and fifth-placed Liverpool make up the top six. "Manchester United? Yes. They have a great squad," added Conte. "There are 14 games to play and five teams as well as us who can fight to win it. It's important we don't make mistakes in the race." Chelsea face a trip to Burnley on Sunday for a 13:30 GMT kick-off. The Clarets have won their last seven games at home in all competitions with 28 of their 29 league points so far this season coming at Turf Moor. "There are teams at the bottom who win and draw so you must have the right concentration," said Conte. "If your ambition is to stay in the top four or top six, you can have highs and lows. "If you want to win [the title] you must have concentration and focus and know that in every game you can lose points."	Chelsea manager Antonio Conte says it would be a "very big mistake" for his side to think they are close to winning the Premier League title.
Deliveries of the double-decker will now fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and eight in 2019, Airbus said. Chief Executive Tom Enders said that prospects of further sales of the A380 in the short-term were not "necessarily high". Airbus, which has not had an A380 order for two years, makes the wings at its factory at Broughton, north Wales. The company said on Thursdays that production of the A380 continued to operate at a marginal loss. In June, Airbus unveiled an upgraded version of the world's largest passenger jet, promising greater fuel efficiency and room for more seats. Airbus hopes it will be the catalyst for more orders from airlines. Also on Thursday, Airbus posted second-quarter operating profits which fell 27% to 859m euros (Â£765m) on revenues of 15.27bn euros. That fell short of the 910m euro profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters. On Wednesday, shares in rival Boeing hit a record high after its second-quarter profit and cashflow came in well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Production at Airbus has been hit by delays in delivery of US engine-maker Pratt & Whitney's engines for the A320neo aircraft. The fuel-saving Geared Turbofan engine has suffered reliability problems. On Thursday, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said Pratt & Whitney had to "work harder" to fix the problems. "It should be a winning engine but they need to fix it," he told reporters. "Pratt & Whitney has introduced some fixes but we are still waiting for these improvements to come through." He also said that Airbus was in "constructive talks" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350 aircraft, adding, "I think we will find a way out" of the issue.	European aircraft maker Airbus has cut production of its A380 superjumbo for the second time in a year.
Joe Murphy's scrambled early goal was the ideal start for Down and they led 1-8 to 0-6 at half-time. With Caolan Mooney starring, the Mournemen extended their advantage to six midway through the second half. Meath reduced Down's lead but they home side held on after a nervous finish. Down went into the game propping up Division Two after disappointing opening defeats by Fermanagh and Clare. County secretary Sean Og McAteer felt compelled to release a length statement on Thursday night denying reports of unrest within Eamonn Burns' squad and Saturday's win will be a huge boost for the management. After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory. Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest. With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval. O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period. Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points. A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal. After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time. Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

The 67-year-old was attacked outside his Gateshead home on 25 January and suffered a broken collar bone. Beautician Katie Cutler, 21, began a campaign to raise £500 but the target was quickly smashed. A 25-year-old man has been charged with intent to rob and will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on 24 February. Mr Barnes and Ms Cutler had not met before she started the campaign but say they have since struck up a firm friendship. He intends to use the money to buy a new home as he does not want to return to the area where he was attacked. Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall. He said: "I've always wanted to do other things that I've found difficult with having my eyesight problem but she seems to have opened doors and I might be able to do it now. It's sinking in."

Galloway also missed the end of last season, having ruptured the Achilles tendon in his other leg. The 31-year-old's latest injury will also rule him out of Scotland's squad for the World Cup starting in October. Galloway has made 43 appearances for Leeds since joining from NRL side Wests Tigers ahead of last season.	Leeds Rhinos prop Keith Galloway will miss the rest of the season after rupturing his Achilles tendon in the Super League win over Hull FC.
The incident, in a village in western Bengkulu province, sparked a rare debate in Indonesia about sexual violence. The maximum penalty would have been 15 years each, but the judge said he took into account the boys' youth. The girl, Yuyun, went missing on 2 April on her way back from school. Her body was found in undergrowth two days later by villagers, bruised, beaten and with her hands tied. The case was not widely covered by Indonesian media until it was picked up by activists online several weeks later. That led to protests in the capital, Jakarta, and prompted the Minister for Child Protection Yohana Yembise to call for rapists to face the death penalty. Five men are also facing trial in connection with the case, and police say two more suspects are still on the run.	Seven boys below the age of 18 have been sentenced to 10 years in jail each in Indonesia for the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.
The woman was taken to hospital after the incident involving a male inmate at Maghaberry Prison, near Lisburn, on Monday. Adrian Smith from the Prison Officers Association (POA) told BBC News NI the woman was one of the newer prison officers. He said he believed she was attacked with a weapon "made from a razor". "She has an approximately three inch deep cut below her left ear," he said. "With the ever increasing budget cuts, I believe this will happen more often," he added. A Prison Service spokesperson said: "The Prison Service utterly condemns this attack and has referred the incident to the PSNI".	A prison officer has suffered a serious neck wound after she was attacked at a jail in County Antrim.
People in the South Ham area of Basingstoke complained about the noise coming from the ground between 22:00 BST on Saturday and 08:00 on Sunday. The club has apologised, blaming a wi-fi receiver picking up the frequencies of the radio systems of taxis. Resident Leighton Oliver has criticised the club for not acting sooner to stop the noise. He added it could be heard three miles away. Another resident, who did not want to be named, told BBC Radio Berkshire he was woken by a "horrible scraping noise". "It was like someone had put a microphone beside a really badly tuned radio," he said. "It was so loud I'd be surprised if anyone got any sleep." Basingstoke Town FC chairman Raffi Razzak said: "It's very unusual - it seems that the wi-fi in our PA box, which has been there for years for some reason, has started to pick up the frequencies of the radio systems of taxis. "It was coming and going when a taxi passed with [its] music on. "We never thought for one minute it could pick up signals from outside." He said the system would be completely turned off when not in use in the future. A Hampshire Police spokesman said officers had checked the premises after a call from a member of the public concerned that the social club may have been broken to. Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council said its out-of-hours call centre received six calls about the noise. "We will be speaking to the football club to clarify what exactly happened and the safeguards and procedures they have in place to ensure a situation like this doesn't happen again," a spokeswoman said.	Hundreds of people suffered a sleepless night when a football stadium's PA system played loud, distorted music.
There will be posters with the slogan "liar, liar" aimed at MPs who U-turned over their pledge to oppose fee increases for universities in England. "We won't let them trade lies for power again," said NUS president Toni Pearce. "The system now is fairer than Labour's fees system," said a Lib Dem spokesman. The coalition government's decision to raise tuition fees in England to a maximum of Â£9,000 provoked a series of sometimes violent student protests. Much of the anger was aimed at the Liberal Democrats, who had targeted the student vote in 2010 with personal pledges to vote against any tuition fee increase. In the current election campaign, the NUS is seeking to mobilise the student vote against MPs who had promised to oppose higher fees but then voted to almost treble them. "I'd like to say directly to Nick Clegg that your apology won't cover any of the Â£40,000 debt that students will graduate with for the first time this summer," said NUS president, Ms Pearce. "They pledged to scrap tuition fees - they lied. We won't let them trade lies for power again. We represent seven million students and are urging every single one across the country to vote against broken pledges." This election issue includes funding for schools, university tuition fees and early years education. Policy guide: Where the parties stand The campaign will involve advertising vans, billboards and newspaper adverts, says the NUS. It is aimed at 28 Liberal Democrats, including leading figures such as Nick Clegg, David Laws and Vince Cable. There are also two Conservative MPs who are accused by the NUS of failing to keep a promise to oppose the fee increase. There were another 21 Liberal Democrat MPs who kept their pledge to vote against the fee increase. The NUS also published a poll of issues that will be important to student voters, which found the biggest concern is cost of living. There have been warnings from students of a lack of recognition for problems in paying for accommodation and living costs and lack of maintenance loans. Labour has promised to cut tuition fees to Â£6,000 per year, while the Conservatives want to lift the cap on undergraduate university places and have called for more value for money for students. Some university leaders have been critical of proposals to cut fees, arguing that higher fees have not deterred poorer students. University applications dipped when fees were increased, but have since recovered to record levels, with more disadvantaged students applying than when fees were lower. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: "I'm not prime minister, I lead a party of 8% of MPs in the House of Commons, there was no money left... Labour had introduced and whacked up fees before we had come into office. "But I actually think what we did was incredibly impressive for the smaller party in the coalition, all our front page priorities we stuck to - and we will do so again." And a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: "There will be some people who will judge us for one thing we could not do. But many fair minded people will judge us by what we have been able to do: tax cuts for millions of working people; more money for poor children in schools; a record two million apprentices; equal marriage; shared parental leave."	The National Union of Students has launched a "payback time" campaign against MPs who broke their 2010 election promise over tuition fees, including leading Liberal Democrats.
The couple, who have been dating since 2011, wed in front of about 10 people in Mazan, Provence - close to where the bride's family has a holiday home. Mayor Aime Navello told the Associated Press he married them at the town hall. The short service was followed by a reception for family and friends, reported to have included Righton's bandmates and actress Sienna Miller. Knightley, 28, announced her engagement to Righton, 29, last year. "Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James," Mr Navello told the Daily Mail. "I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them." The actress, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, is the daughter of playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley. She rose to fame in the British hit Bend it like Beckham, becoming an international star in films including Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 'More interesting' Knightley also won critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Atonement, A Dangerous Method and, most recently, Anna Karenina. Later this year, she will be seen in Jack Ryan - a prequel to previous Tom Clancy adaptations - playing Cathy Ryan opposite Chris Pine. Singer and keyboard player Righton has performed with indie rock band the Klaxons since 2005. The group won a Mercury Music Prize in 2007 for their debut album Myths Of The Near Future. In an interview last month, Knightley said she did not want an extravagant wedding day. "We're not 'big wedding' types. I don't need to have all that. I'm just trying to enjoy the engagement bit. "My parents are together after 40 years. The fights are there but they love each other. "It's not like the first three months, the first two years... whatever it is, but I think it gets more interesting, or I hope so."	Actress Keira Knightley has married Klaxons star James Righton in the south of France.

Bernard Mensah struck a post for Aldershot after 11 minutes, but the visitors were a man down midway through the first half when Jim Kellerman saw red for a foul on Ross Stearn. The Shots regrouped and took a deserved lead in the 42nd minute when Idris Kanu latched on to a through pass and poked the ball under Ryan Clarke. But in the second half Eastleigh's extra man began to tell as they pushed forward and, with 10 minutes left, McAllister fired home from close range after getting on to the end of a flick-on. That was enough to earn Eastleigh their first point in five outings, while Aldershot extended their unbeaten run to 10 games. Report supplied by the Press Association.

"I genuinely believe that being on death row for 22 years ultimately saved my life. It was the greatest adventure of my life, and I survived it." Nick Yarris has never had an apology for being imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. He spent almost all that time in solitary confinement, sometimes being beaten so badly by prison guards that, on one occasion, his retina detached. "The hardest thing to do when people are hurting you is to remain a decent person," he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. While on death row, he educated himself about the law, and sometimes read up to three books in a day. "The whole purpose of my education ultimately was so I could deliver a statement eloquently before my execution," he said. For 22 of the 23 years he spent in prison, Nick genuinely believed he would be executed. Nick has now written his own book about his life called "The Fear of 13", because he believed bad things happened to him around the 13th date. "I didn't mind the 23 hours a day solitary confinement for the majority of the time, because after the first few years in prison, when I stopped being angry and started to like myself and understand myself, it was OK. I still enjoy my own company sometimes. "I've never had any psychiatric help since leaving prison. I studied psychology in there and applied it to myself." Nick grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia with his parents and five siblings, but his happy childhood was shattered when, aged seven, he was attacked by a teenage boy who hit him on the head so hard it gave him brain damage and then raped him. He did not tell his parents. The trauma of this assault led his behaviour into a downward spiral and as he got older he began drinking and taking drugs. He was arrested, aged 20, after being accused of the attempted kidnap and murder of a police officer - a charge of which he was later acquitted. But while in custody before that trial, Nick was desperate to get out and so made up a story, telling police he knew who committed the murder of a woman, Linda Mae Craig, who he had only read about in the newspaper and had never met. "I was just desperate, a drug-addled kid who didn't know what to do to get out of jail." He said the murderer was a man with whom he once briefly lived. Nick thought the man - who had stolen money from him - had later died and so believed he could safely trade this false information for his own freedom. However, the man Nick accused was still alive and the lie was exposed. The police then charged Nick with these crimes instead. In 1982, he was convicted of the woman's rape and murder and sent to death row. During his imprisonment in Pennsylvania jails, Nick's only possessions were a couple of paper sacks full of legal materials, some novels, toiletries and a small radio. He was only allowed to exercise for 30 minutes on weekdays in a small cage. He would spend 14 years, from 1989 to 2003, without being touched by another human being. During this time, he would lie on his arm until it went numb and then use it to rub his face, as though it were someone else. In 1988 he became the first man on death row in the United States to ask for DNA testing, but this led to years of heartbreaking delays and churning frustrations, such as when a vital package containing DNA samples burst open when it was posted to a laboratory, destroying the evidence. Eventually, Nick sought the most extreme form of relief from his imprisonment. "In 2002 I was ready to be executed and I asked to drop my legal appeals so that the execution process would be carried out." But then a judge ordered one final round of DNA testing and evidence came back and cleared him in 2003, demonstrating that there were DNA traces of two unknown men in the car and on Linda's clothing. Linda's killer has never been found and Nick received compensation for his wrongful conviction, although it "feels like pity money" to him. "When I got out, I got a mantra from my mother, who sat me down and said that I had to be a polite and kind man from now on and that I had to be kind to women, otherwise it was a waste of coming home. "She did me a huge favour. I began creating positive passages in my brain that changed my thoughts for the better." He also said that when he got out, he noticed how "people weren't as reserved as they were". "In prison you're not allowed to give out your opinion. But now everyone's expected to give their opinion on social media." He now campaigns for the abolishment of the death penalty, has spoken in front of officials at both the United Nations and European Union and has given around 300 talks in schools. And it was a trip to the UK, to speak to MPs in Parliament, that led him to fall in love with England, where he has lived since 2005. "It felt like a permanent holiday away from my woes," he said. Now a father and living in Ilchester, Somerset, he recently saw a photo from his own childhood, showing 27 children from his neighbourhood in the 1970s. He is the only one still alive, the others dying through drugs, car accidents or violence. Both his brothers died because of drugs and alcohol abuse. He added: "I see my prison past as an old movie I watched that scarred me, but now I don't get so bothered about it. "If I hadn't have gone to prison, then my life wouldn't be as good as it is now. I never look at it in a negative way." The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. International viewers can see clips from the programme here.	Nick Yarris spent more than two decades on death row in the US after he was wrongly convicted of rape and murder, before a DNA test eventually freed him.
People with a DNA variation in a gene called PDSS2 tend to drink fewer cups of coffee, a study carried out at the University of Edinburgh has found. It suggests the gene reduces cell ability to break down caffeine. This causes it to stay in the body for longer and means those with the gene get the same caffeine hit through less coffee. One scientist working on the project said it suggests the "drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes". The researchers studied the DNA of 370 people living in a small village in southern Italy and 843 people from six villages in north-east Italy. The subjects were asked to complete a survey including a question about how many cups of coffee they drank each day. The team found people with the PDSS2 DNA variation tended to consume fewer cups of coffee than people without the variation - equivalent to one fewer cup daily on average. Researchers replicated the study in a group of 1,731 people from the Netherlands. The result was similar but the effect of the gene on the number of cups of coffee consumed was slightly lower. The scientists said the change could be down to the different styles of coffee drunk in the two countries. In Italy, people tend to drink smaller cups such as espresso whereas in the Netherlands the preference is towards larger cups which contain more caffeine overall. Dr Nicola Pirastu, a Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The results of our study add to existing research suggesting that our drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes. "We need to do larger studies to confirm the discovery and also to clarify the biological link between PDSS2 and coffee consumption." The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports and was conducted at the universities of Edinburgh and Trieste, the Burlo Garofolo Pediatric Institute in Italy, the Erasmus Medical Centre and PolyOmica, a data analysis company based in Groningen, the Netherlands.	Researchers have identified a gene that appears to curb coffee consumption.
The women had been legally married for a few months after one of them passed as a man in front of an Islamic cleric who presided over their wedding. But suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police. The two women are now back with their families, forcibly separated and under surveillance by the Islamic police. The local Sharia police chief told them Islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done. But Aceh, the only province in Indonesia that is allowed to implement Sharia law, has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people. The provincial parliament passed Islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009, but the governor has refused to sign it. Homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in Indonesia. Activists have blamed Aceh's Sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance, and say they violate the Indonesian constitution.	Islamic police in the Indonesian province of Aceh have forced two women to have their marriage annulled and sign an agreement to separate.
The UK will maintain an EU deal, which provides 48 countries with duty-free access to Britain for imports. It means British firms do not pay import tariffs on goods bought from countries such as Bangladesh and Haiti. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Brexit gave the country an opportunity "to step up our commitments to the rest of the world". He added: "Free and fair trade has been the greatest liberator of the world's poor, and today's announcement shows our commitment to helping developing countries grow their economies and reduce poverty through trade." The deal excludes arms and ammunitions. The list of countries - which also includes Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda - is based on the UN's Least Developed Countries index. Currently Â£19.2bn of goods are imported from the 48 countries, including 79% of the tea consumed in Britain. Some 45% of the UK's textile and clothing imports, and 22% of its coffee, also come from the developing nations. International Development Secretary Priti Patel said the renewed commitment would "help the world's poorest people stand on their own two feet". She added: "Building a more prosperous world and supporting our own long-term economic security is firmly in all our interestsâ€Ž." The government also intends to explore options to expand relationships with richer countries like Jamaica, Pakistan and Ghana, which currently enjoy a mixture of reduced tariffs or zero tariffs. Dr Fox added it would result "in lower prices and greater choice for consumers".	Free trade deals with developing countries will continue post-Brexit, the government has said.
They found the link after analysing observational studies involving more than 300,000 people. UK experts said people with long-term illnesses and undiagnosed diabetes often felt tired during the day. But they said there was no evidence that napping caused or increased the risk of diabetes. The large study, carried out by scientists at the University of Tokyo, is being presented at a meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Munich. Their research found there was a link between long daytime naps of more than 60 minutes and a 45% increased risk of type-2 diabetes, compared with no daytime napping - but there was no link with naps of less than 40 minutes. The researchers said long naps could be a result of disturbed sleep at night, potentially caused by sleep apnoea. And this sleeping disorder could increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, cardiovascular problems and other metabolic disorders, including type-2 diabetes. Sleep deprivation, caused by work or social life patterns, could also lead to increased appetite, which could increase the risk of type-2 diabetes. But it was also possible that people who were less healthy or in the early stages of diabetes were more likely to nap for longer during the day. Shorter naps, in contrast, were more likely to increase alertness and motor skills, the authors said. Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said there was now a lot of evidence of some kind of link between sleep disturbances and diabetes. "It's likely that risk factors which lead to diabetes also cause napping. This could include slightly high sugar levels, meaning napping may be an early warning sign of diabetes," he said. But proper trials were needed to determine whether sleeping patterns made a difference to "real health outcomes". Dr Benjamin Cairns, from the cancer epidemiology unit at the University of Oxford, said the findings should be treated with caution. "In general, it is not possible to make conclusions about cause and effect based on observational studies alone, because usually they cannot rule out alternative explanations for their findings," he said.	Napping for more than an hour during the day could be a warning sign for type-2 diabetes, Japanese researchers suggest.
It is the first time the high-security facility has invited watchdog Healthwatch to speak to its residents. They will be asked for their views on a range of healthcare issues, including GP services and dentistry. West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which runs the unit, said it was a "groundbreaking initiative". The announcement came after the hospital, based in Crowthorne and home to some of the UK's most notorious killers, was issued with a Care Quality Commission warning notice in December. Carolyn Regan, chief executive of the trust, said receiving patient feedback was "crucial to ensuring we are providing a responsive and high-quality service". She said: "Having an external independent organisation such as Healthwatch listen to patient feedback is even more valuable." Mark Sanders, of Healthwatch Bracknell Forest, said: "Patients within a high secure forensic hospital should have as much say about the services they receive as any other patient. "We are happy to be able to support that voice for patients and feedback to West London Mental Health NHS Trust to improve the services and environment offered."	Psychiatric patients detained at Broadmoor are being asked for feedback on their care by an independent watchdog.
Premier had suspended its shares on 13 January after agreeing to buy E.On's North Sea assets for a net $120m (Â£84m) plus working capital adjustments. The deal was amended during the suspension so that it no longer constituted a reverse takeover. By close of trading, Premier's share price was up by nearly 90% to 36p. London-based Premier said the cost of the deal would now come to $135m, including completion adjustments. Premier added that this was a result of an increase of the dividend paid to E.On before completion of the deal. In a statement, it said: "On the basis of this lower aggregate consideration, the acquisition has been classified as a Class 1 transaction." The proposed acquisition is still subject to approval by Premier's shareholders and lenders. The assets Premier is buying are located in the Central North Sea, West of Shetlands and the Southern Gas Basin. E.On's UK oil and gas upstream portfolio includes stakes in 40 licenses, including a 5.2% interest in the Elgin-Franklin field, a 47% interest in the Babbage field and a 50% stake in the Tolmount discovery. The deal will add about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to Premier's production totals in 2016, according to the company.	Premier Oil's shares nearly doubled in value on Monday after trading was restarted following a suspension triggered by a major North Sea deal.
Tshibola, 20, came through the Royals' academy system and signed his first professional contract last summer. He made his professional debut against Nottingham Forest in August. Bingham, 21, joined Mansfield from Wigan Athletic in the summer and has scored four goals in 20 games for the Stags in all competitions. Pools are awaiting clearance from the Football Association and the Football League for the duo to feature against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.	Hartlepool United have signed Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola on a one-month loan deal and Mansfield striker Rakish Bingham on a season-long loan.
Strachan has indicated a willingness to cap some of the country's young talents as he begins preparations for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. Some of BBC Scotland's football analysts, all of whom have played for Scotland, give their thoughts on which players deserve the chance to impress the national manager in Prague and Glasgow later this month. Position: Central midfield Age: 24 Experience: A product of the Aberdeen youth system and has been capped up until under-21 level. Former Aberdeen defender, manager and director Miller said: "He's got everything you need to make the step up from club to international level. "In that defensive midfield role, he has great composure, a good touch, he doesn't get flustered and he's happy to take the ball in tight areas. "At a young age, he's been given the captaincy of a title-challenging team, which he's handled well and he plays an extremely prominent role in a very good Aberdeen side." Position: Central midfield Age: 21 Experience: Came through the youth ranks with St Mirren before switching to Championship rivals Hibernian after the Paisley's club's relegation last summer and is a regular for Scotland Under-21s. Former Dundee United, Rangers, Cardiff City and Burnley striker Thompson said of his former Buddies team-mate: "I've known him since he made his debut for St Mirren and it looks as though this season he's really turned from a boy to a man. "He's physically stronger and he now has the belief and confidence that he's a top midfielder. "He's the complete midfielder: he can tackle and be combative but also creative, with driving, surging runs. "Despite only being 21, he's played more than 100 league games, so he's got great experience and has managed to maintain a level of consistency throughout this season." Position: Left-back Age: 18 Experience: Has not even represented Scotland beyond under-19 level as yet but burst into the Celtic first-team from their youth ranks this season and ousted Honduras international Emilio Izaguirre from the left full-back position with the Scottish champions. Former Dundee United, Celtic, Bristol City and Dumbarton right-back Wilson said: "He may only have played 23 times for Celtic, but at 18 he's been a real stand-out in a lot of those games and, if you're a stand-out at Celtic, that speaks volumes. "Given the pressure and scrutiny they're under, he's stood up to the challenge and, even in European games, he's been the man of the match. "He has a great engine; he can get from goal-line to goal-line and, unlike a lot of young full-backs, he hasn't sacrificed the defensive part of his game just to concentrate on the attacking aspect. "There are a lot of similarities with Andy Robertson in that he can make a tackle at one end and then be putting in a quality cross at the other within seconds - and he's got quite a number of assists already." Position: Winger Age: 22 Experience: Has played for Scotland at all youth levels after coming through the youth ranks with Hearts and has recently returned from long-term injury to resume his place in the first team at Tynecastle. Former Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Hearts, Hibernian, Genclerbirligi and Charlton Athletic midfielder Stewart said: "Unfortunately, he's missed a chunk of the season through injury, but he's come back and hit the ground running with three goals in three games. "He's an exciting talent who has the ability to unlock defences with his dribbling skills and also his vision. "At 22, he is now becoming a mainstay of the Hearts team and is at the perfect age to try to get into the senior Scotland squad and continue his progress."	Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is to announce two squads this week for the forthcoming friendly internationals against the Czech Republic and Denmark.
Hughes was carried off on a stretcher at the Sydney Cricket Ground after he was struck on the top of the neck by a short-pitched delivery from Sean Abbott, 22, during a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales on Tuesday. Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland has paid this tribute to Hughes, describing him as a "hero to kids around the nation". Australia cricket team coach Darren Lehmann, via Twitter: "RIP you little champ, we are all going to miss you. Love, prayers to all the Hughes family xxxx." Cricket Australia on Twitter: "The strength of the cricket family is more important than ever on this incredibly sad day. Please keep Sean Abbott in your thoughts." Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott: "Phillip Hughes was a young man living out his dreams. For a young life to be cut short playing our national game seems a shocking aberration. He was loved, admired and respected by his team-mates and by legions of cricket fans." Media playback is not supported on this device Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard: "It's a terrible accident and it should be seen in that light, it's nobody's fault. It's a terrible accident and it's a terrible loss to his poor family and I send my prayers and thoughts to them." England batsman Nick Compton, who played with Hughes in Sydney and shared a house with him in London in 2009: "He was a very, very close friend of mine. He was a cheeky, funny, positive guy. Looking back, I feel like he's made the most of his 25 years and it breaks my heart to think of a guy who I certainly thought would go down in the record books as one of the better run-scorers in Australian cricket." The England team released a statement on Twitter, saying: "Our deepest sympathies go out to Phil Hughes' family, friends and teammates at this incredibly sad time. Phil was admired and respected by all he played with and against and will never be forgotten by the cricket community." England bowler Stuart Broad on Twitter: "Just can't believe it, heartbreaking stuff. RIP Phil Hughes." England bowler Jimmy Anderson on Twitter: "Can't quite believe the news. Devastating. My thoughts go out to Phil Hughes' family and friends. Thoughts also with Sean Abbott." England batsman Joe Root on Twitter: "Awful to wake up to the news of Phil Hughes. Tragic day for the sport. Thoughts go out to those close to him." Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen on Twitter: "NO NO NO NO NO. RIP, Hughsey #63notout" Lord's Ground on Twitter: "Absolutely devastated to wake to the news of Phil Hughes' death. The MCC Flag at Lord's will be lowered in his memory." MCC president David Morgan: "Cricket can be a dangerous sport, but for a talented young man to lose his life playing the game he loved is beyond most people's comprehension." ECB chairman Giles Clarke: "He was an extremely popular and hugely respected cricketer in England and Wales not only as a successful tourist with various Australian teams but also as a wonderfully talented county player with Hampshire, Middlesex and Worcestershire." Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Twitter: "Just far too young. He was only doing the job he loved and was brilliant at it." Former England captain Ian Botham on Twitter: "A very sad day for the world of cricket. So sorry for Phillip Hughes and his family. Spare a thought for Sean Abbott." Former England captain Andrew Strauss speaking to Sky Sports News: "The most sickening aspect of all of this is that he was a guy in the best years of his life and that was extinguished out of the blue. "He was only 25 and to have achieved what he did in such a short period of time was extraordinary. He was modifying his game all the time as well. "It is a tragedy that he is gone in terms of cricket, but that pales into insignificance when compared to what his friends and family are going through." Former England captain Mike Gatting: "The reaction just shows how much the guy made an impact on people around the world. It was a freak accident that has taken someone at the prime of his career and has so much more to give." Former England bowler Dominic Cork, who played alongside Hughes at Hampshire: "I will remember him as a very fine young cricketer trying to make his way back into the Australia side. "Sharing the same dressing room as him, he was a man you would always remember. He always had a cheeky smile on his face, always wanted to be the best and wore that baggy green with such pride. "We have lost one of the bright hopes who would have been a big success in the game." Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes, who coached Hughes during his season with the county side: "He was very humble, good fun and nobody had a bad word to say about him. He spent a lot of time working with the younger players, passing on his knowledge which was great for us." Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, reflecting on Hughes' spell with his county in 2010: "I cannot begin to comprehend the loss of a talented, ebullient and lovely lad. "In the Australia dressing room after the international T20 at the Ageas Bowl in 2013, Hughesy said to me that after Shane Warne, Simon Katich, Shane Watson and Michael Clarke he felt like Hampshire's forgotten Aussie. "I told him then, and I say it again now, you will never be forgotten Hughesy - you are part of our family. Rest in peace buddy." Former England Test batsman Paul Collingwoodon Twitter: "Cricket has lost a super talented cricketer but most of all a lovely, lovely man. All our thoughts with his family." The India team currently touring Australia also released a joint statement which read: "The touring Indian team joins the cricketing fraternity across the world in offering condolences to the family of Phillip Hughes, who has departed from our midst. In this moment of grief, we pray that they are bestowed with divine strength to overcome this unfortunate tragedy. "As fellow cricketers we cherish the memories of playing along with him and deeply respect his contribution to the game of cricket." Australia batsman David Warner on Instagram: "RIP my little man. You will always be with me when I walk out onto the field. Not just a mate but a loved one to us all big man. Forever in my heart brother for life. Miss you buddy." Former Australia spinner Shane Warne, speaking to Sky Sports News: "He is very, very humble. He loved the game and wanted to the best player he possibly could. It is just an absolute tragedy. "It is just so, so sad and horrific We've lost one of the good guys." Former Australia cricketer Glenn McGrath: "Such terrible news with the passing of Phil Hughes. Our deepest sympathies to his family." Former Australia fast bowler and Yorkshire first team coach Jason Gillespie, speaking to Sky Sports News: "A lot of the Australia lads will have grown up playing cricket together and it will be a very tough time for them. "Sean Abbot is a lovely young kid who was just running in and doing his job, bowling balls and it was one of the last things that he would have expected. "We are really feeling for him right now and everyone who was there." Australia Test spinner Nathan Lyon: "Today we lost one of the greats. RIP Hughes #408 #willbemissed #loveyamate." Australia all-rounder Steve Smith via Twitter: "Rest in peace Hughesy. I am really going to miss you. You were one of the great blokes and I will never forget you. #408 will live on forever." Australia batsman Shaun Marsh via Twitter: "You defined character, courage and most of all laughter, you will be missed by many my friend. RIP" Former paceman Brett Lee, who also played alongside Hughes in the national team, tweeted a picture of him sat alongside the batsman and said: "No words can describe the loss. RIP." South Australia team-mate Kane Richardson: "It was an honour to play alongside you at club, state and international level. You were an absolute genius on the field and a loveable lad off it. "To know that we will never share a changing room again hurts, but I am privileged to know that we did. Every time I pull on one of those caps above I will think of you. "I don't know how we will go one without you, but we will have to find a way, which is what you always did. Even in your last innings they still couldn't touch you. 63*. RIP Brus, Son, Boss, maaaaaate." Former News Corporation chief cricket writer Malcolm Conn: "He was a very quiet kid in public, but very cheeky among his team-mates and very well liked, not only in Australian cricket, but around the world. "He was a short nuggety little fellow, but he had just the biggest, most infectious smile, anyone who got to know him could not fail to be positively affected by his smile and the way he engaged with people." Australian Olympic cyclist Anna Meares via Twitter: "Sheer shock and sadness at the passing of Phil Hughes. My condolences and thoughts with his loved ones, friends and team-mates." Australian Olympic swimmer Stephanie Rice via Twitter: "Awful, awful news. What a devastating end to an incredibly talented athlete. My love goes out to everyone who cared and loved for you Phils." Legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar on Twitter: "Shocked to hear about Phil. Sad day for cricket. Deepest condolences to family, friends and well wishers. RIP." Former South Africa fast bowler Shaun Pollock on Twitter:  "Absolutely shocked to hear the news of Phil Hughes passing away. Thoughts and prays are with his family as well as Sean Abbott." South African cricketer AB de Villiers via Twitter: "Heart broken. A very dark day. You will be missed, Phil Hughes. My prayers and thoughts go out to his family & friends." South African fast bowler Dale Steyn via Twitter: "Totally saddened by the passing of our cricket brother and friend Phil Hughes. Terrible loss. Deepest condolences to his family." Sri Lanka cricketer Mahela Jayawardene: "Just heard the worst news possible... our thoughts & prayers are with Phil, his family & friends. RIP Phil Hughes."	Cricketers, politicians and sports people have paid tribute to Australia cricketer Phillip Hughes, 25, who has died two days after being hit by a ball while batting for South Australia in a domestic game.
Staff in Jobcentres, banks, building societies and utility companies in England could also be trained to spot - and counsel - vulnerable people. The ideas are raised in a consultation paper on suicide prevention. The Samaritans said councils should have a mandatory responsibility to try to prevent suicides in their areas. Some 4,400 people killed themselves in England in 2009. Claire Wylie, head of policy and research at the Samaritans, told the BBC News website that many suicide attempts were made on impulse, so trying to restrict access to potentially lethal means was important. "We know that people who are feeling suicidal are often very ambivalent about actually ending their lives," she said. "If you can interrupt them at that moment you can prevent them going ahead." Preventing deaths by jumping is a key aim of the consultation and it suggests a number of ways of doing that. They include: Overall, the number of suicides has steadily fallen in recent years, but the number of deaths on Britain's rail network had been rising until last year. However, specialist training from Samaritans for rail staff was key to an 11% fall in 2010, according to the Rail Safety and Standards Board. London Underground is also rolling out training to all of its staff after a pilot project at one station close to a psychiatric inpatient unit helped reduce suicides. The government wants to see that sort of training given to a much wider range of people who come into contact with individuals who could be vulnerable because of their social or economic circumstances. Jobcentre and benefit office staff, as well as employees in banks, building societies and utility firms are among those suggested in the consultation. Ms Wylie said: "More training for all frontline staff is really important, but that needs investment and money is tight. "In general, we really welcome the government's strategy, but there needs to be a lot more actual commitment to action. "There's also an issue about local implementation because things like putting up signs and barriers depend on the individual local authority actually caring about suicide prevention. "We would like to see a mandatory responsibility placed on local authorities to take this seriously." The consultation closes on 11 October.	Multi-storey car parks, bridges and tall buildings could be designed to make suicide more difficult, under government proposals to save lives.
Researchers have found a 90% fall in levels of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in Scottish women since the vaccine was made available in 2008. HPV virus types are thought to account for about 90% of cervical cancers. Scientists hope the drop in HPV cases will lead to a significant drop in future cervical cancer cases. The researchers, led by senior epidemiologist Dr Kevin Pollock at Health Protection Scotland, said they hoped to see a decrease in new diagnoses within a year. He told BBC Radio Scotland: "The two HPV types we were vaccinating against - HPV 16 and HPV 18 - cause about 70% to 80% of cervical cancers within Scotland but the vaccine has exceeded our expectations because it appears to have knocked out another three high-risk HPV types which cause about 10% of cervical cancers. "So we do forecast within the next few years a 90% reduction in cervical cancer within Scotland." Researchers compared the cervical screening and vaccination records of women born in 1995, who had been vaccinated as teenagers, with those from unvaccinated women born between 1989 and 1990. They found just 0.5% of women from the 1995 group tested positive for the virus, compared with 21.4% of women born before 1990. The study also showed evidence that the vaccine protected against three other high-risk HPV genotypes involved in the development of cervical cancer. The research will be presented to the Microbiology Society's annual conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday by Dr Kate Cuschieri, director of the Scottish HPV Reference Lab. She said: "These new findings indicate that the positive impact of the HPV vaccine may be even greater than we initially thought. "Collectively, these data demonstrate the significant and continued benefits of the HPV vaccination programme in Scotland, which has achieved a consistent and high uptake of around 90% in 12 to 13-year-old girls." Dr Pollock added: "The very high uptake of the HPV vaccine is strongly associated with these massive reductions in high-risk HPV types that are known to cause approximately 90% of cervical cancer in Scottish women." He said the virus was also known to cause a number of other cancers, including vulvovaginal, anal and a subset of head and neck cancers. "These results suggest that this vaccine will also have a significant impact on these cancers in the years ahead", he said. The research, which was funded by the Scottish government, looked at samples from more than 20,000 women, making it one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of the vaccine. There were 388 new cases of cervical cancer in Scotland in 2014.	A campaign to vaccinate girls against a cancer-causing sexually transmitted infection has led to a dramatic drop in reported cases.
The Celtic captain was unable to exert his influence as Rangers reached the Scottish Cup final on penalties. "I would look at Andy Halliday," said Ferguson when considering the key moments. "I thought he was exceptional. "Scott Brown is a fiery character and I think Andy met fire with fire and he matched him in that department." Brown missed an excellent first-half chance before Rangers went ahead and the Celtic skipper was also unsuccessful from the spot in the shoot-out after the match finished 2-2 at the end of extra-time. "I think Andy's quality on the day outshone Scott and he is getting a lot of stick," Ferguson told BBC Scotland. "He is the captain, you expect him to play. Whether he had an off day or not, I think probably Scott's role in the team is to get other players playing, but unfortunately for himself he didn't play particularly well. "But there were reasons for that and the reasons were Andy Halliday." Rangers were ahead twice, first through Kenny Miller and then from a stunning strike from winger Barrie McKay, who was voted the sponsor's man of the match. Erik Sviatchenko and later Tom Rogic levelled for Celtic. However, it was 24-year-old former Livingston, Middlesbrough and Bradford City midfielder Halliday who caught Ferguson's eye most. "Barrie McKay is getting a lot of plaudits - it was a wonderful goal - but for me, in that engine room, it was Andy Halliday," said Ferguson. "I thought he was phenomenal. A lot of people are making remarks about how much he was like my brother, Barry. "He is a Rangers man and you could see that throughout the game. "He played with a lot of aggression - but a lot of quality - and he drove Rangers on." Rangers have already won the Championship title and promotion, but Ferguson thought that manager Mark Warbuton would need to strengthen his squad during the summer in order to compete with Celtic in the top flight. "I think he's got a great philosophy in terms of the way he wants to play and, if he can add some quality players to that philosophy, I think Rangers could be a force next season," he said. Ferguson's fellow former Rangers midfielder, Stuart McCall, who had a spell as manager last season, agreed. "Obviously, Celtic will look to their side and look to strengthen, Rangers will be strengthening and maybe Hearts and Aberdeen too," he said. "All in all, it will be a fantastic Premiership next season and there will be teams who will think they can go ahead, but there is a long way to go. "Celtic will look back at chances that went begging and they hit the woodwork a couple of times, but I think Rangers can look forward now to a very good end to the season."	Andy Halliday's domination of Scott Brown in midfield was the key to Rangers' victory over Celtic, according to former Ibrox player Derek Ferguson.
The 19-year-old moved to Glasgow a year ago and has played in more than 40 games for the Scottish champions. His 18-month deal ends in the summer and Roberts intends to return to City to battle for a place. "I'll always have that belief; the more you play, the more you improve," said Roberts. "It's been my first proper season playing men's football. I did a bit at Fulham, but I was in and out, the same at Man City, so coming here, the manager before [Ronny Deila] played me a lot and Brendan's [Rodgers] been really good with me as well. "It's been good and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I came here to improve, to win trophies and score goals. "Hopefully at the end of the season I can take that back with me to City and have a good go there. It's been a great experience and I'm thankful for that." Roberts has often found Scott Sinclair and James Forrest starting games ahead of him this season, but the winger says he has learned from working alongside Sinclair in particular. He also insists that the camaraderie within the squad has been a significant factor as Celtic reached the Champions League group stages and have put together a run of 25 unbeaten domestic matches. If Celtic can avoid defeat against St Johnstone on Wednesday, they will equal the record of 26 set by the Lisbon Lions in the 1966-67 season. Roberts, though, insists that the players are not giving too much thought to the record. "The team spirit's been great since day one, when the manager came in and the boys came back for pre-season," he said. "We've kept each other going, we've had good times, fun together, and done well on the pitch. It shows in results and if we continue to do that, it should be a very good season for us. "It's [about] momentum, you feel good, positive and go into every game believing you can win. The more you win, the more positive you are. We're in good stead right now and we'll go into Wednesday firing and ready to go. "We're just going out with the mentality to win every game. On Wednesday we'll show that again. We'll be buzzing to be back in the league and looking to put on a good show. "It's more other people [looking at the record], we just focus on trying to win. We'll do all we can to do that and focus on the game."	Patrick Roberts believes his loan spell at Celtic will prepare him for the challenge of trying to break into the Manchester City first team.
Daniel Filmus, Argentina's minister for the islands - called the Malvinas locally - announced the case in London. The companies involved are Falkland Oil and Gas, Premier Oil, Rockhopper, Edison International and Noble Energy. Mr Filmus told the BBC the companies were "performing illegal acts by entering Argentine territory". He added: "I want to make it clear for the directors of these companies and for British public opinion that Argentina will use the full force of the law - both national and international law - to prevent these countries from taking the riches which belong to 40 million Argentine citizens. "Argentina has extradition treaties around the world and we intend to use them." He added that the area being drilled was "as much ours as the centre of Buenos Aires. Neither the UK nor any other country would allow anyone to enter their territory and take away their riches." In response, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused the Argentines of "outrageous bullying". He said the islanders had a "perfect right to develop their own economic resources and Argentina needs to stop this kind of behaviour and start acting like a responsible member of the international community". The Falklands Islands government also said the Argentines had no case. "We have the right to develop our economy, including the hydrocarbons industry, and we are exercising that right," it said. "It is worth remembering that it was the government of Argentina who walked away from working with the Falkland Islands on the development of a hydrocarbons industry some years ago. "Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands and this latest action is clearly another attempt by Argentina to try to block economic growth in the Falkland Islands." Analysts suggested Argentina would have little joy in the courts. "The Argentines will lose," Malcolm Bracken at Redmayne Bentley told the BBC. "They have no jurisdiction - the UN settled the matter in 1982." In fact, he said the country's current position would prove counterproductive. "All they're doing is handing any possible benefit that Argentina may have had from the oil boom in the south Atlantic to Chile. "There'd be an awful lot of logistic support needed for drilling that simply isn't available in the Falklands. They'd need a port somewhere and that's likely to be near Chile rather than Argentina, so they're cutting their own nose off to spite their face." Earlier this month, Argentine foreign ministry officials said they would prosecute oil companies operating near the Falkland Islands. The officials said companies active there were operating illegally in Argentine territory. This came after the three British oil companies announced new oil and gas finds north of the islands, and as Argentina marked the 33rd anniversary of the war with the UK over the islands. Tensions between the UK and Argentina were already running high after the UK announced it would spend Â£280m over the next 10 years on improving defences on the islands.	Argentina has begun legal proceedings against three British and two US companies for drilling oil near the Falkland Islands.
Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane both hit centuries as India posted 622-9 declared in their first innings. Sri Lanka were never in the game once they were bowled out for 183 in reply. They managed 386 in their second innings - Dimuth Karunaratne making 141 - but India's spinners sealed victory on the fourth afternoon. Ravindra Jadeja picked up the man-of-the-match award after hitting an unbeaten 70 off 85 balls at number nine before taking 2-84 and 5-152 with the ball. India won the first Test in Galle by 304 runs. The third and final Test gets under way in Pallekele on 12 August. Jadeja will miss that match after he was suspended for a breach of the International Cricket Council's disciplinary code. The all-rounder pleaded guilty to the charge, which related to throwing the ball "in a dangerous manner" towards Karunaratne as he fielded off his own bowling on day three. He lost 50% of his match fee and earned three demerit points, taking him to a total of six in the past two years, leading to a one-game ban.	India completed a series win over Sri Lanka with a crushing victory by an innings and 53 runs in the second Test in Colombo.
Mohammad Amir took 3-63 for the hosts, his best figures since his return from a spot-fixing ban, to ensure victory for the hosts in their 400th Test. Bravo's 116 gave West Indies - chasing 346 to win - hope, before he fell to Yasir Shah to leave them 263-7. Pakistan wrapped up victory with 12 overs to spare. The second match of the three-Test series starts on Friday in Abu Dhabi. Beginning the final day on 95-2, West Indies - now without a win in 12 Tests - lost Marlon Samuels caught behind off the first ball to Amir. But Bravo shared half-century stands with Roston Chase and captain Jason Holder and reached three figures off 211 balls, having hit nine fours and a six, to bring West Indies within sight of what would have been the third highest successful run chase in Tests. The experiment of having a day-night Test in the United Arab Emirates looks to have failed after a lacklustre turnout across the five days. While 123,736 fans packed into the Adelaide Oval across three days in November 2015 for the first ever day-night Test between Australia and New Zealand, official figures suggest just 6,000 spectators watched the action over five days in Dubai. On Friday, the first of the weekend in the UAE, the crowd was a little over 2,400 at its peak despite an entry fee of just AED 20 (£4.50). Problems with the pink Kookaburra ball arose too, despite its seam being strengthened and coloured black to make it easier for the batsmen to see. The pink ball had to be changed after just three overs in Pakistan's second innings on the fourth day after losing its shape - with just one ball throughout the duration of the Test lasting the full 80 overs. Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur: "There's some work to do with the pink ball. I don't think it's up to the standard required yet and I think that's the only thing holding day-night cricket back. "We didn't get the pink ball to reverse swing and we saw it get soft quite quickly, so it has a way to go." Former West Indies captain Sir Viv Richards: "I don't think they have fully sussed the right ball just yet and the jury is still out with the changes in shape and discolouration of the ball, but once they get that right the future may look a little bit brighter. "We have to try various ways and means to give new excitement to the game. I remember when one-day cricket started there were some issues with the white ball and it's still very much in existence so we need to give the pink ball a chance." Former Pakistan captain and coach Waqar Younis: "Test match cricket is still the pinnacle and we have to preserve it. We haven't fiddled with it too much from the beginning and I don't think we need to do too much. "Some pitches may end up being too juicy for the pink ball in the evening. "If it's attracting crowds, which I haven't seen it do here in Dubai, then I am for day-night Tests but if it isn't then we need to stick to cricket the way it is now."	Pakistan clinched a thrilling 56-run win over West Indies in the day-night Test in Dubai despite a Darren Bravo century on the final day.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 24-year-old missed the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction last month in order to concentrate on his international future. Vince has played three T20 matches so far for England, scoring 125 runs, with a strike-rate of 119.04. "If it's a platform to go on and play other formats for England, then that'll be ideal," he told BBC South Today. "First and foremost, I'm going to try and help England win the World Cup and try to learn off some very good players when I am out there. "It will be a good experience and one I cannot wait to start." County team-mates Liam Dawson and Reece Topley have also travelled to Mumbai with the England T20 squad. All-rounder Dawson, 26, was included despite head coach Trevor Bayliss admitting he had never seen the all-rounder play competitively, while left-arm paceman Topley was preferred to Chris Woakes. Led by captain Eoin Morgan, England's first match will be against the West Indies on 16 March, with Sri Lanka and South Africa and a group winner from the first-round qualifiers their other Super-10 opponents. "I think having it in the unofficial home of cricket is massively exciting," said Topley, 22. "It's going to be brilliant and it's definitely going to be testing." "Everybody talks about the size of the grounds being a little smaller. They talk about the heat and the dew at night having an effect. It will be a great occasion."	Hampshire captain James Vince says the ICC World Twenty20 can help put him on the path to playing Test cricket.
Firefighters tackled the blaze, which started just before 21:00 on Monday in Carron Valley. The home owners and their dog escaped from the building after being alerted by a smoke alarm. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze, although it is not believed to be suspicious. Station manager Dave Wishart said: "Firefighters were deployed in strategic positions surrounding the building with high-pressure jets and worked through the night to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. "Unfortunately the intensity of the fire meant the house was completely destroyed." "The home owners became aware of the fire quickly and had a working smoke alarm. "This helped them to get themselves and their dog out safely."	A house in Denny has been destroyed after a fire broke out in its roof space.
Mr Cairns said it would be "completely wrong" to remain in the EU's single market as both major UK parties told voters they wanted to leave. But he played down differences with the Welsh Government over Brexit. The UK government is under pressure to change its approach to leaving the EU, which critics call a "hard Brexit". Mr Cairns's predecessor, Stephen Crabb, claimed the election had changed the terms of the Brexit debate. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties. Mr Crabb told BBC Wales: "The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally. "And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties." Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the process of listening to devolved governments had begun. "It is seven times more important now because of the result of the election that the devolved countries have a real voice in the process of leaving the European Union," he said. Mr Cairns, newly re-appointed to his role, said he wanted Brexit negotiations, due to start next week, to focus on the right outcome with businesses trading freely. "We've talked about frictionless trade, the Welsh Government have talked about unfettered access. These are one and the same things," he said. "Even the Labour Party don't want to remain part of the single market so it would be completely wrong to stay in the single market when the two largest parties are opposed to that." But Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP Simon Hart echoed Mr Crabb's call for cross-party consensus. He said he did not buy the idea that because Theresa May has had "an unquestionably difficult time for which she takes some of the blame" it means "it's game over".	Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has rejected calls for a "softer" Brexit after the general election result led to a hung parliament.
Most rogue extensions bombard people with ads, but the most malicious steal login names and other valuable data. Carried out by security experts and Google, the project analysed more than 100 million visits to the search giant's sites. It led to Google purging almost 200 bad extensions from its online catalogues of browser add-ons. Extensions and add-ons for web browsers add all kinds of functions and features to the software. Many of these extensions have hidden extras that cause trouble for people who install them, said UC Santa Barbara computer scientist Alexandros Kapravelos, who worked with Google on the rogue extensions project. The research found that malicious extensions were available for every major browser. The findings are due to be published in full in May at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. Preliminary results revealed that 5% of people accessing Google every day have been caught out by at least one malicious extension. Of these victims, about a third have four or more bad add-ons installed in their browser. "It is a very hard problem to deal with," said Mr Kapravelos. Some bad extensions were easy to spot, he said, because they were so obviously written to steal saleable data such as bitcoins, bank logins or personal data. However, many used techniques seen in legitimate extensions, he said, and it took a lot of extra analysis to pin down the bad ones. "Even when we have a complete understanding of what the extension is doing, sometimes it is not clear if that behaviour is malicious or not," he said. "You would expect that an extension that injects or replaces advertisements is malicious, but then you have AdBlock that creates an ad-free browsing experience and is technically very similar." Experts from Swedish security firm ScrapeSentry said it had found examples of extensions that gathered data in ways that could easily be abused. ScrapeSentry's analysis of one extension, called Webpage Screenshot, revealed that it contained code that let it grab copies of all the browser traffic from the PC on which it was installed. The gathered data was then sent to a server in the US. The extension has been downloaded about 1.2 million times. "What happens to the personal data and the motives for sending it to the US server is anyone's guess, but we'd take an educated guess that it's not going to be good news," said Martin Zetterlund from ScrapeSentry. A spokesman for Webpage Screenshot said there was nothing malicious about the data it gathered. Instead, said the spokesman, it was used to understand who the extension's users were and where they were located to help drive development of the code. Users could opt out of sharing data, he said. Mr Kapravelos said Google had acted on the early findings of the research by removing 192 actively malicious extensions from its Chrome catalogue. About 14 million people had been tricked into using these extensions, he said. The UC Santa Barbara team was working with Google to develop tools that can automatically spot malicious extensions and flag them to the search giant's security staff. In addition, said Mr Kapravelos, firms whose adverts were being injected onto webpages by the rogue extensions had been informed. Unfortunately, he said, ad injection had become "entrenched" as a way for some unscrupulous developers to make money. The research found that only a small number of developers were behind the majority of the rogue extensions that pepper people with ads, suggesting that targeted action could help tackle the problem.	Tens of millions of users who visit Google sites use a browser loaded with malicious add-ons, research suggests.
Patrick Maloney, 43, died as a result of "multiple crushing injuries" after he was hit by a vehicle at Toddbury Farm, Little Billington, near Leighton Buzzard on 2 August. A second man, Thomas McCarthy, 24, of Toddbury Farm, was previously charged with murder and remains in custody. A woman, 42, arrested on suspicion of murder has been bailed until September. Mr Maloney's wife described him as a "gentle giant". Bedfordshire Police said a post-mortem examination showed the victim, a father-of-three, died as a result of injuries "consistent with being involved in a collision with a vehicle".	A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a man at a travellers' site in Bedfordshire.
It will be the first time that the tournament has been held in England since 1993, when the home side beat New Zealand in the final at Lord's. The tournament, which starts on 26 June next year, consists of 31 matches, with Lord's hosting the final on 23 July. It will feature eight teams and will be played in a round-robin format. Steve Elworthy, the ECB's director of events, said the tournament will help "drive interest and participation in women's cricket at every level". He added: "It's critical we use this event to reach out to young children in particular, so we've moved the tournament start date to earlier in the summer, a decision which will help our host venues encourage attendance by engaging with schools in the build-up to the event."	Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Lord's have been named as venues for the ICC Women's World Cup in 2017.
In a report, the agency says the past decade in Europe has been the warmest on record. It adds that the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events is rising, and the continent is set to become more vulnerable in the future. The findings have been published ahead of next week's UN climate conference. They join a UN Environment Programme report also released on Wednesday showing dangerous growth in the "emissions gap" - the difference between current carbon emission levels and those needed to avert climate change. "Every indicator we have in terms of giving us an early warning of climate change and increasing vulnerability is giving us a very strong signal," observed EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. "It is across the board, it is not just global temperatures," she told BBC News. "It is in human health aspects, in forests, sea levels, agriculture, biodiversity - the signals are coming in from right across the environment." 2C or not 2C The report - Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 - involving more than 50 authors from a range of organisations, listed a number of "key messages", including: As it currently stands, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has set a target of limiting the rise in global mean temperature to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the report's authors warn that even if this target to mitigate warming is met, "substantial impacts on society, human health and ecosystems are projected to occur". To limit the impacts, experts say effective adaptation strategies need to be developed in order to minimise the risk to nations' infrastructure, homes and businesses. The European Commission is expected to publish its European Adaptation Strategy in 2013, outlining measures it think will help the 27-nation bloc deal with future climate shifts. Examples of adaptation measures include using water resources more efficiently, adapting building codes to be able to withstand extreme weather events and building flood defences. Prof McGlade said such measures would be essential in order to climate-proof the EU. "I think what the European Commission and other parts of the world are finding is that whilst it is important to understand what is happening at the global level, it is what is happening at the regional and local levels that will really determine how economies will weather the storm," she said. The report said the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events had increased from 9bn euros (Â£7bn) in the 1980s to 13bn euros in the 2000s. One of the report's authors, Andre Jol, head of the EEA's vulnerability and adaptation group, added: "We know that the main increase in damage costs from natural disasters has not been from climate change, as such, but more as a result of an increase in wealth, people and infrastructure in risk areas. "But one of the key messages from the report is that in the future, with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, we know that climate change will contribute to the increase in the cost of damage from extreme events." 'Lack of action' On Monday, the World Bank published a report that warned that the world was "on track to a 4C [increase by the end of the century] marked by extreme heatwaves and life-threatening sea-level rise". It added that the world's poorest regions would be hardest hit by the warming, which was "likely to undermine efforts and goals". "A 4C warmer world can, and must be, avoided - we need to hold warming below 2C," said World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim. "Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today." However, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) warned that it was still possible to achieve the 2C target but time was running out. Data in the Emissions Gap Report showed that annual greenhouse gas emissions were now "14% above where they need to be in 2020". Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: "While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties." The reports have been published ahead of the annual two-week UN climate conference, which starts on Monday in Doha, Qatar.	The effects of climate change are already evident in Europe and the situation is set to get worse, the European Environment Agency has warned.
My confusion stems from the proposals for tax, benefit and economic reform submitted by the Greek government to secure, at the very last minute of the last hour, a deal from their creditors to avoid tumbling out of the euro. Having obtained a copy of this paper, headed "Greece: Prior Actions - Policy Commitments and Actions to be taken in consultation with the EC/ECB/IMF staff", it feels very familiar. That familiarity stems from its great similarity to the bailout proposals put to Greece by the creditors - the eurozone governments, the European Central Bank and the IMF - last month. Pretty much everything wanted by the creditors is there - with the odd tweak or softening, but nothing which looks as though it ought to be noxious to them. So there is a pledge for budget surpluses rising in steps to 3.5% of GDP or national income by 2018; VAT would be raised to three rates of 23% (the standard rate), 13% (for food, energy, hotels and water) and 6% (for medicine and books) - increases that would raise revenue equivalent to 1% of GDP; and Athens is eating the dust of comprehensive reforms of pensions to make them more affordable; and so on. So here's why I am a bit baffled. Only a few days ago the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras won an overwhelming mandate from the Greek people, in a referendum, to reject more-or-less these bailout terms. And today, on the back of that popular vote, he is signing up to the supposedly hated bailout. This is big politics that would make Lewis Carroll proud. Does that mean the eurozone can go back to life as normal, of inadequate economic performance but Greek Armageddon deferred (again)? Is a rescue done and dusted? Not yet. Tsipras has to get these proposals through the Greek parliament today - though his pax of earlier this week with the main opposition parties will surely deliver that (at the price of the splintering away of some of his own supporters). Then there is the small question of whether eurozone ministers will stump up the 35bn euros requested by Greece from the European Stability Mechanism to meet debt repayments through to June 30 2018. And Athens wants a nod that there'll be proper negotiations on reducing its completely unaffordable debt burden by around 30%, as per the IMF's recent sustainability analysis (which would be achieved through the backdoor route of rescheduling repayments closer to the end of time, rather than through the direct write-offs that so offend Germans and east Europeans). Finally, and most problematically, something has to be done to take the banks out of intensive care. Given the recent melting down of the Greek economy, my sources tell me there is now a solvency problem for Greek banks, to add to the awkwardness for them that they are almost out of cash. Here is the point. If a way isn't found to allow the banks to re-open within days - and the ECB simply maintaining Emergency Liquidity Assistance won't come anywhere near to achieving that, but the ECB has lost all appetite for throwing more good money after bad - the Greek economy will implode so that any bailout deal agreed this weekend will become irrelevant in weeks. Because the Greek economy would be so melting down that tax revenues would collapse and Athens would need yet more eurozone handouts.  Greece and the eurozone isn't yet fixed, not even close.	Not for the first time over the five years of Greece's euro crisis - or the eurozone's Greece crisis - I am confused.
Clubs are required to provide accurate details of training sessions and player whereabouts so they are available for testing at all times. The Cherries were deemed to have failed to ensure its information was accurate on three occasions. Manchester City were fined £35,000 and given a warning, after admitting a similar breach earlier this month. Bournemouth have yet to learn their punishment from the FA, but are expecting similar sanctions. It is understood part of the charge concerns a player not informing the club of his new home address, while another part relates to members of the Under-21 squad training with the first-team at short notice.	Bournemouth have accepted a Football Association charge relating to a breach of anti-doping rules.
HS2 Ltd, the company behind the rail link from London to northern England, last week said the redevelopment of the station would finish in 2033 - seven years later than planned. Sir Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, said those living nearby faced "decades of blight" from construction. But the HS2 minister said the area would benefit from the redevelopment. The first phase of HS2 will be between London and Birmingham and will be followed by a V-shaped section to Manchester and Leeds. Euston is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse. In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed that the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed. They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033. HS2 Ltd said the changes meant the construction would be less intense. But speaking to the Commons on Tuesday, Sir Keir rejected that: "We have had plans, amended plans and further amended plans for Euston. "The only sensible plan is to abandon the project altogether. "This plan, far from being an improvement on the other plans, is the worst of the lot and leaves my constituents with all of the pain and none of the gain. "And I focus here particularly on the phased approach - it offers and sets up decades of blight with no assurance about when the project as a whole will be finished." HS2 Minister Robert Goodwill said Euston needed to experience the same regeneration as King's Cross-St Pancras, also in north London. He said: "Our Euston proposal is fully compatible with the redevelopment of the remaining Network Rail station and our proposals have been developed with Network Rail and (Transport for London)." Replying to Sir Keir, Mr Goodwill said disruption for commuters also needed to be considered alongside disruption faced by residents. He said reports suggesting there would be reductions in platform space were "not correct". Mr Goodwill also said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was "very keen to see the resurrection of the Euston Arch". Euston Arch, which was built in the 1830s, stood at the front of the station until it was demolished in 1962 when the station was rebuilt. He said: "We think we know where the bits are, and indeed the Euston Arch Trust aims to reform the arch and it's for them to bring this forward through a local planning application, but we have a location in the new Euston Square Gardens for the arch to come forward."	Plans to redevelop London Euston as part of the high-speed railway line HS2 should be scrapped, an MP has said.
The migrant crisis has fuelled a backlash against the political establishment, but the wave of discontent also taps into long-standing fears about globalisation and a dilution of national identity. How is this right-wing backlash reshaping Europe's political landscape? In recent years the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) has shaken up the centrist consensus politics that dominated Austria for decades after World War Two. But in April 2016 it went further, pushing both main parties out of the running for the presidency. The FPOe candidate, Norbert Hofer, won the first round of Austria's presidential election in April and then secured around half the vote in the run-off vote on 22 May. The result was so tight, it was not immediately clear if he had won. The president's role is largely ceremonial. But Mr Hofer's score reflected widespread voter frustration with immigration and the political establishment. Hundreds of thousands of migrants poured through Austria last year hoping to settle in Germany. Some 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria itself - 1% of the population. When the late Joerg Haider led the party it achieved its best ever result in 2000 and entered the government, causing enormous tension with EU partners. European Parliament seats (MEPs): 4 Far right tops presidential vote Austria sets asylum cap Far-right party ELAM entered parliament for the first time in May 2016 elections, securing two seats from voters stung by the island's acute financial crisis in 2013. Affiliated to Golden Dawn in Greece which many observers see as neo-Nazi, ELAM has held demonstrations against Turkish Cypriots and migrants. It opposes the idea of reunifying an island divided since Turkey invaded the north in 1974 in response to a Greek-inspired military coup. Denmark's immigration rules are among the toughest in Europe - reflecting the power of the Danish People's Party (DPP), which came second in last year's general election. Its 21% of the vote was a record for the party, and now the ruling coalition depends on DPP support in parliament. The Eurosceptic DPP also won Denmark's European Parliament election in 2014 by a wide margin, with 27% of the vote. The DPP opposes multiculturalism, as do nationalists in the rest of Scandinavia, where centre-left social democracy no longer dominates in the way it did for decades. Denmark became a target of Muslim anger in 2005 when Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Controversially Denmark has given its police the authority to seize valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (Â£1,045; $1,514) from refugees to cover housing and food costs. The government has also cut migrant benefits and put adverts in Lebanese newspapers warning against migration to Denmark. MEPs: 3 Anti-EU Danish party gets big boost Denmark backs seizing migrants' assets The nationalist Finns Party (previously the "True Finns") came second in last year's general election. Party leader Timo Soini is Finnish Foreign Minister, in a coalition government. The party advocates strict immigration controls and argues that Finns, not migrants, take priority for social and healthcare spending. Its roots lie in rural Finland and it has championed welfare policies that give it a populist dimension. MEPs: 2 Who are the nationalist Finns Party? Many political observers see Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) as the biggest nationalist challenge to Europe's liberal democratic traditions. Ms Le Pen is expected to make a formidable push for the French presidency next year. That is likely to trigger a repeat of tactical voting by the Socialists and conservative Republicans to block her. The FN won 6.8 million votes in regional elections in 2015 - its largest ever score - but lost in two target regions after the Socialists pulled out and urged supporters to back Nicolas Sarkozy's conservatives. Marine's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, the FN founder who was fined for Holocaust denial, shocked France in 2002 when he won through to the second round of the presidential election. Marine famously got him expelled from the FN in a family feud last August. The FN has two seats in the French National Assembly (parliament) and in 2014 won the French European Parliament election, taking 25% of the vote. Marine Le Pen is anti-EU, rejecting the euro and blaming Brussels for mass immigration, because of the Schengen free-movement policy. In 2010 she told FN supporters that the sight of Muslims praying in the street was similar to the Nazi occupation in World War Two. The Islamist attacks on Paris in January and November, which nearly 150 people were murdered, raised alarm about jihadists taking advantage of Europe's open borders. MEPs: 21 Le Pen condemns 'campaign of lies' Anti-EU MEPs form nationalist bloc German politics has been shaken up by Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing party launched in 2013 by economists opposed to the euro. Under leader Frauke Petry it has drawn ever more support by rallying against immigration. The AfD's success has been interpreted as a sign of discontent with Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Last year Germany took in a record 1.1 million asylum seekers, many of them Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The AfD has seats in half of the German state parliaments, though none yet at national level in the Bundestag. Ms Petry has called for "drastic steps" to prevent Islamist ideology spreading in Germany, including a ban on construction of new minarets.  She says Islam "does not belong to Germany" - though Muslims who "practise their religion peacefully and privately" can be good citizens. She sparked a furore when she suggested that border police should be empowered to shoot illegal migrants if necessary. Her deputy Beatrix von Storch backed that suggestion. Stridently anti-Islam rhetoric came initially from Pegida, a mass movement that started in the eastern city of Dresden, then spread to other German cities. Pegida regularly draws thousands of supporters at anti-immigration marches. Neo-Nazi groups are among the Pegida followers, who denounce "the Islamisation of the West". AfD MEPs: 2 Profile: AfD leader Frauke Petry Germany jolted by right-wing poll success The popularity of far-right Golden Dawn - widely considered to be a neo-Nazi party - has surged during Greece's economic meltdown. Members have been accused of serious crimes including murder. The party's leaders went on trial in 2015 over the murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas. Yet Golden Dawn secured 7% of the vote in the September 2015 election, and it now has 18 MPs, making it the third biggest force in Greek politics. Its vote was especially strong among people hardest hit by the crisis. The austerity demanded by Greece's creditors turned many Greeks away from the political establishment. The anti-EU party wants to expel migrants and has distributed food in poor areas - but only to Greek passport-holders. MEPs: 3 Jail fails to deter Greek far right Far-right Jobbik is the third strongest party in Hungary - it won 20.7% of the vote in the 2014 general election. The party denies that it is racist, but has organised patrols by an unarmed but uniformed "Hungarian Guard" in Roma (Gypsy) neighbourhoods. Jobbik says more must be done to tackle "Gypsy crime" and party members have also stirred controversy by making anti-Semitic remarks. Hungarian flags dominate Jobbik rallies, along with the red-and-white Arpad stripes, which are often seen as an echo of Hungary's pro-Nazi wartime regime. With Jobbik support the conservative government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban erected a razor wire fence along its border with Serbia last year to keep migrants out. Mr Orban and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico are suing the EU over its quota scheme for distributing migrants among member states. Both leaders say Europe has to defend its "Christian" heritage. Jobbik MEPs: 3 Jobbik woos centrist voters Local elections last year delivered big gains to the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration Northern League (Lega Nord) beyond its Venice power base. Since the party's launch in 1991 it has called for the creation of a separate northern state called Padania, combining Veneto, Lombardy and some other regions. But today its emphasis is less on secession, more on boosting the northern regions' autonomy and paying less tax to the central government. The influx of migrants from North Africa has put a severe strain on Italy's asylum infrastructure and revived the fortunes of the Northern League. Some of the party's politicians have made xenophobic comments about migrants. The party got 4% in the last general election, in 2013. MEPs: 5 Italy leaders feud over migrants Rise and fall of the House of Bossi Geert Wilders, with his mane of blond hair, is one of Europe's most recognisable nationalist politicians. His anti-EU Party for Freedom (PVV) has surged to the top of Dutch opinion polls. He wants to stop Muslim immigration, arguing that Islam is incompatible with Dutch values. He wants the Koran to be banned in the Netherlands. He is currently involved in a court case, accused of inciting hatred against Moroccans. In the 2010 general election the PVV won 24 seats, making it the third-largest party. MEPs: 4 The ultra-nationalist People's Party-Our Slovakia of Marian Kotleba entered parliament for the first time this year, winning 14 seats. Mr Kotleba has previously dressed in a uniform modelled on the Hlinka Guard, the militia of the 1939-45 Nazi-sponsored Slovak State. But now he wears corduroy casuals. Immigration was a major issue in the election campaign, even though Slovakia has taken in very few migrants. Robert Fico's Smer-Social Democracy party won - and he contributed to the anti-Muslim rhetoric. Smer MEPs: 4; Our Slovakia MEPs: 0 Slovakia's Nazi history returns to the fore Slovak election: PM Fico sees Muslim 'threat' The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) have challenged the traditional dominance of Sweden's Social Democrats, a party associated with generous social welfare and tolerance of minorities. The SD argues for strict immigration controls, opposing multiculturalism. In 2014 the SD became the third-largest party, winning 13% in the general election. But they are shunned by other parties in parliament. More than 160,000 asylum seekers arrived in Sweden in 2015 - the highest per capita rate in the EU. MEPs: 2 Migrant crisis dominates Sweden's politics In October 2015 the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party (SVP) won the parliamentary election with a record 29.4% of the vote. That translated into 65 out of the total 200 seats in the lower house. Switzerland is not in the EU, but is in Europe's Schengen free-movement area, and has a high population of immigrants compared with its neighbours. Support for the SVP has grown during the migrant crisis. For years the party has pushed for tough immigration controls, using controversial black sheep posters that opponents describe as racist. It spearheaded a campaign to cap EU migrant numbers - and the Swiss voted to do so in 2014. But there is now EU-Swiss legal wrangling over free movement of workers, as the Swiss appear to be defying the Schengen rules. Anti-immigration SVP wins Swiss vote	Many European countries are witnessing electoral gains for far-right and nationalist parties, though they span a wide political spectrum.
The Dutch firm said the 26.9bn euro (Â£22.8bn) offer undervalued Akzo and showed a "lack of cultural understanding of the brand". The company, which claims its own plans for growth are superior, has been urged to reject a merger by the Dutch government and its own workers. But some Akzo investors favour a deal. PPG said it was disappointed by Akzo Nobel's decision and would "review" the firm's response. It comes several weeks after PPG increased its offer to buy the Amsterdam-based firm for the second time as it seeks to create an industry leader in the paints and coatings sector. The US firm suggested the bid was its last friendly attempt to merge with Akzo and has not ruled out putting the matter directly to shareholders. But responding on Monday, Akzo chief executive Ton Buchner said his team had conducted an "extensive review" of the bid and had again found it wanting. "The PPG proposal undervalues AkzoNobel, contains significant risks and uncertainties, makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding," he said. Akzo says its own plans for the firm - which involve spinning off its chemicals division into a separate business - would better serve shareholders. It has promised to increase its dividend for 2017 by half and pay a 1bn euro special cash dividend in November. However, it also faces mounting pressure from some of its biggest shareholders to consider a deal, having repeatedly refused to enter talks with PPG's management. Last month, the activist investor Elliot Investors also called for a vote to oust chairman Antony Burgmans - a proposal Akzo rejected. In its favour, Akzo has won political support against a tie-up, with four provincial governments having warned of its impact on jobs. The company also says that PPG would struggle to get the deal past Dutch competition regulators, which poses a risk to shareholders. As part of its latest offer, PPG offered commitments on jobs and to pay a break fee in case the deal was rejected by officials. In a statement on Monday, it said: "[Akzo] has once again refused to enter into a negotiation regarding a combination of the two companies, ignoring the best interests of its stakeholders, including long-term shareholders who overwhelmingly support engagement." Akzo Nobel shares fell more than 2% in morning trading in Amsterdam but have jumped about 30% this year.	Akzo Nobel, the owner of Dulux paint, has rejected a third takeover offer by US rival PPG Industries, leaving the door open to a hostile bid.
Arwel Robson's late penalty edged it, the fly-half picking himself up to score after being felled by flanker Jacopo Bianchi, red-carded for the hit. Callum Bradbury, Ryan Conbeer and Phil Jones claimed tries for Wales. Giovanni D'Onofrio and Dario Schiabel crossed for Italy, with Antonio Rizzi kicking 14 points. Jason Strange's young Wales side lost to Australia,England and Scotland during the tournament, with their only other victory coming against Samoa. Wales U20: Phil Jones (Ospreys); Jared Rosser (Dragons), Ioan Nicholas (Scarlets), Owen Lane (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Conbeer (Scarlets); Arwel Robson (Dragons), Reuben Morgan-Williams (Ospreys); James Botham (Cardiff Blues), Will Jones (Ospreys, capt), Shane Lewis-Hughes (Cardiff Blues), Will Griffiths (Ospreys), Kieron Assiratti (Cardiff Blues), Elllis Shipp (Dragons) Rhys Carre (Cardiff Blues). Replacements: Owen Hughes (Dragons), Tom Mably (Cardiff Blues), Steff Tjomas (Scarlets), Aled Ward (Cardiff Blues), Syd Blackmore (Bath), Dane Blacker (Cardiff Blues), Connor Edwards (Dragons), Cameron Lewis (Cardiff Blues).	Wales ended their World Rugby Under-20 Championship campaign on a positive note by beating Italy in the seventh-eighth place play-off in Tbilisi.
The rail operator had warned ongoing negotiations meant that drivers were not volunteering for Sunday shifts. ScotRail said it aimed to run two-thirds of its services and buses would replace trains on some routes. The operator has published an amended timetable listing cancelled services and those with reduced frequency. On Wednesday, ScotRail said it had offered drivers a 2.5% pay rise and a one-off bonus, and would increase driver numbers. But Aslef accused the Abellio-owned operator of trying to push new terms and conditions through. Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "It is simply astonishing that significant service reductions are being announced only three months after Abellio assumed control of the ScotRail franchise. "Their approach to workforce planning and industrial relations appears nothing short of shambolic and contrary to the impression they were anxious to portray during the bid process. "The Scottish government must now answer serious questions over how service cuts and amateur industrial relations are permissible under the terms of a very detailed franchise agreement." A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: "Industrial relations are a matter for the employer and the union. "It is in the best interests of passengers that ScotRail and Aslef come together to resolve this issue as quickly as possible to avoid unnecessary disruption. "Keeping passengers informed and ensuring they can plan ahead with confidence in advance is a key priority and people should check the updated timetables on the ScotRail website before they start their journey." ScotRail have said that although they will be running fewer trains on Sundays, most of the trains that do run will have more carriages. It claimed this would provide almost the same capacity as was offered by the normal services on every route. The rail operator has advised customers to plan ahead for the weekend.	ScotRail has cancelled a third of its usual services this Sunday, after pay talks with train drivers' union Aslef stalled.
Cardiff narrowly missed out on the Championship play-offs last term, finishing eighth in the table. But under new head coach Paul Trollope, Pilkington thinks the Welsh side are capable of better. "We fell just short [last season] and we were all really disappointed with that. We felt we had the squad to get in the play-offs definitely," he said. "It's going to be a tough season again, just like it was last year, but hopefully we can be right up there come the end of the season." Pilkington, 28, scored Cardiff's first goal in their 4-0 friendly win at Shrewsbury on Saturday. The Republic of Ireland international played in attack, having moved from the wing to a central forward role last season. Pilkington made the transition under former Cardiff boss Russell Slade, who was replaced by Trollope in May. Trollope had been working under Slade before then, and Pilkington believes that smooth transition has helped the Bluebirds in their preparations for the new campaign. "The gaffer was working with us last season so we know how he works," he added. "We know what he's about and we know we have to be on our toes all the time. "He's come in and changed a few things. It's been good up to now so hopefully we can carry on working really well."	Cardiff City forward Anthony Pilkington believes the Bluebirds can challenge for promotion this season.
The school has stopped the game, also known as "tag" or "you're it", to allow the children "some time to settle down a bit", according to the headmaster. The ban is the latest in a line of stories from around England of educational establishments outlawing everyday activities, many of which are remembered fondly from people's own school days. BBC News looks back at other forbidden school pursuits that have made headlines: We start off with a perhaps unsurprising measure many schools enforce. British Bulldog involves charging towards fellow pupils, a drop of the shoulder to fool the 'bulldogs' and a rapid dash to the safety of the other side of the yard. These figures are a little old (like the above image), but over a quarter of 653 school staff surveyed by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in 2011 said it had been banned from their school. One secondary school teacher said it was "because of the number of broken bones it generates!" Schools in Wiltshire, Cumbria and Clackmannanshire introduced a ban on conkers over fears the horse chestnuts could trigger anaphylactic reactions. The Anaphylaxis Campaign said a "common sense approach" would be better, where conkers are put in a safe place after battle and all involved give their hands a good wash. Some schools took to allowing their children to take part in conker fights provided they were wearing protective goggles. A Carlisle headteacher said it was a "sensible" step to shield children's eyes from pieces of flying horse chestnut. In January, birthday cakes were banned at a Blackpool primary school as teachers "do not have time" to check ingredients for pupils with allergies. Parents of children at Norbreck Primary Academy were told cakes taken into school would be "sent home uneaten". The headteacher wrote: "I hate to be a killjoy... there are many reasons for this, some of them serious." Pupils in Birmingham had to leave school after teachers said they were wearing the wrong kind of shoes. Baverstock Academy, in Druids Heath, sent out letters informing families of new rules making plain black shoes compulsory. One parent reported the "ridiculous" decision led to "chaotic" scenes, with about 300 children being sent home. The school later relaxed the rule slightly, according to parents. It wasn't the pupils but their parents who were making a scene at a primary school in Darlington. Grown-ups on the school run were asked by the headteacher of Skerne Park Academy to wash in the morning and to not drop their kids off while wearing pyjamas. The final straw came when parents were turning up to parents' evenings and even the Christmas show in their PJs, the head said. A West Yorkshire head teacher banned books containing stories about pigs from key stage one classrooms in case they offended Muslim children. The literature was removed from classes for under-sevens at Park Road Junior Infant and Nursery School in Batley. Head Barbara Harris said the books would remain in the school library for children to read, but added: "We try to be sensitive to the fact that for Muslims talk of pigs is offensive." Pupils in South Gloucestershire were banned from wearing tinsel to a non-uniform day because teachers say it could cause litter and be dangerous. Staff at Chipping Sodbury school said the festive decoration could cause injury if pupils tried to strangle each other. Children were sent home with a letter citing "health and safety reasons" for the ban. The local council said the day was "far from being against the spirit of Christmas" and was in aid of the charity Crisis.	A primary school in Leeds has introduced a temporary ban on children playing "tig" during break times after "clothes were torn" and pupils were left "upset".
These dinoasurs, including the diplodocus, were the biggest to walk the Earth. T. rex would have nipped at the knees of the largest sauropod - Argentinosaurus huinculensis. University of Manchester researchers have now made a digital Argentinosaurus robot to work out how this 80-tonne monster would have moved its vast bulk. The study is published in an issue of PLoS One on "sauropod gigantism". The immense size of sauropods - the long-necked, tree-trunk-legged storybook giants of the Jurassic period - presents a quandary for biologists because they push animal bones and muscles to their limit. This is why researchers have set out to answer some of the big questions about these very big animals, including: How did their muscles and bones support and move their bodies? How did their digestive system process sufficient food? And how high could they have reached with their immensely long necks (much longer, proportionally, than a giraffe's)? "The biggest elephants weigh around six or seven tonnes," said Dr Bill Sellers, of the University of Manchester, who led the digital robot study. "So Argentinosaurus was at least 10 times bigger than the biggest elephant. "As you get bigger your weight goes up by the cube of your height, but the force your muscles can generate only goes up by the square, so your strength-to-weight ratio gets much worse." As with many dinosaurs, the reconstructions of this giant are based on a relatively limited fossilised jigsaw. For Argentinosaurus, only its legs and part of its spine have been unearthed. So controversy has raged over whether it was possible for an animal to be so huge and heavy and still able to walk on land. "Whenever anyone finds a dinosaur, they want it to be the biggest, meanest dinosaur ever, so there might be a temptation to make a reconstruction a bit bigger than it was," Dr Sellers told BBC News. "We wanted to test whether it was a reasonable reconstruction for an animal." To make the digital dinosaur, Dr Sellers and his colleagues scanned a reconstructed skeleton housed at the Carmen Funes municipal museum in Argentina. They were able to map muscles and tendons on to the skeleton using the anatomy of modern animals, including reptiles and birds, as a guide. Then came the difficult part - their digital dinosaur had to learn to walk. This, Dr Sellers said, required a technique called "machine learning". BBC Nature - Dinosaurs "The animal needs to learn how to move the best way it can using the muscles and skeleton we've given it," he said. This took a huge amount of computer processing power, as the simulated dinosaur robot took the information programmed into its virtual muscles and worked out how to use them to walk. The resulting steady march of this digital dinosaur revealed that, to keep its body steady, the movement at its joints had to be very restricted. "This animal is so big that it's right at the limit of what you could cope with as an animal that lives on land," said Dr Sellers. "So things like getting up off the ground would have been extraordinarily difficult if not impossible." Something else these beasts would not have been capable of, according to Prof Kent Stevens, of the University of Oregon, would be adopting the storybook pose of holding their heads aloft. He says that while "soaring necks is congruous with childhood expectations, the bones tell a different story". For his study, Prof Stevens also created virtual dinosaurs - digitally reconstructing the skeleton of Apatosaurus (better known in the past as brontosaurus). Dr Stevens said: " [If we] put sauropod neck vertebrae back together with the proper separations, and they form a very straight line." He says the bones simply do not have the curves seen in giraffes' or some birds' necks. A natural J-curve in a giraffe's vertebrae direct its neck upwards at a steep angle. A vertebral S-curve gives a swan its shapely neck. But while Prof Stevens' less soaring reconstructions of these dinosaurs might puncture childhood myths, his digital dinosaurs were still capable of impressive feats, thanks to their huge size. As his animations reveal, by sweeping its outstretched neck, Apatosaurus would have explored, and devoured food, over a huge space. "While none were very flexible, sauropods could sweep out broad areas - in some cases 10 or so metres above the ground," Prof Stevens said. All this sweeping and devouring provided a digestive challenge for these huge herbivores. And Dr Marcus Clauss, of the Clinic for Zoo Animals at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, set out to find out how their digestive systems coped. Just as Dr Sellers found that normal bones and muscles could carry 80 tonnes of bulk, it seems there was also nothing unusual about the sauropod gut. "A normal gut can work for any size of body," said Dr Clauss. "A mouse can get enough energy for its size, and an elephant can. The main thing is that [the elephant] eats much more." One key factor that seems to have allowed sauropods to become so gigantic is that they would swallow their food without chewing. As this unchewed food would spend so much time passing through extremely long intestines, it would have ample time to break down. "If you spend so much time chewing, you're limited in the amount of food you can take in," Dr Clauss said. "So one of the conditions for an animal to become that large is that it must not chew." The secret to just how massive these creatures were could be contained in their ancient fossilised trackways. Dr Tom Schanz, of Ruhr University in Germany, has lent his engineering skills to the study of dinosaurs by developing a technique to estimate sauropod weight from a single footprint. He is an engineer who studies the properties of soil to work out exactly how buildings will settle and move on their foundations. Dr Schanz's new method incorporates this expertise. His laser scanning of preserved footprints could produce the most accurate measurements yet of what the dinosaurs weighed. To prove this, Dr Schanz's team took an elephant for a walk. The researchers studied every "dynamic component" of the walk - measuring the speed at which the elephant planted its feet, and how its weight was distributed in each step. "[Then we used the] laser scanning technique on the elephant footprints and back-calculated the weight," Dr Schanz said. The team was able to calculate the elephant's weight to within 10%. And since sauropods and elephants have such similar anatomy, the scientist says the same technique could be used to estimate the weight of the extinct dinosaurs. Building up an accurate picture of how these animals worked is revealing some of the most basic aspects of biology, including how bones and muscles work, and what the very limits are of their ability to function. "That's very important," Dr Sellers says, "because these things go wrong very commonly, and the better we understand them, the better our chances are of fixing them."	In an era of giants, sauropods dwarfed everything.
Three Giants' forwards Jonathan Boxill, Craig Peacock and Colin Shields make the 22-man squad while netminder Stephen Murphy returns after injury. GB take on hosts Italy, Netherlands and Serbia between 11-14 February. The winners will progress to final qualifying for the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang in Korea. Seventeen of the squad who won a silver medal at the 2015 World Championship (Division 1B) in Netherlands are named on the roster. While the tournament is taking place, host club Cortina will travel to Belfast to play at the SSE Arena on Friday 12 February and Saturday 13 February. The Serie A side will contest the 'Olympic Series' against the Belfast Giants in the first ever meeting between the teams.	Four Belfast Giants players have been included in the Great Britain squad for next month's Olympic pre-qualification tournament in Cortina, Italy.
President Robert Mugabe and his wife arrived back in Harare early on Sunday. Mrs Mugabe, 52, is accused of assaulting model Gabriella Engels a week ago at a Johannesburg hotel where her sons were staying. She has not commented publicly on the case. A lawyer for Ms Engels told the BBC that they were planning to challenge the immunity decision in court. Willie Spies said he would argue that the first lady should not have been given special treatment as she had been in South Africa on private business. The South African government's decision came in a notice from International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, published in the Government Gazette on Sunday. "I hereby recognise the immunities and privileges of the First Lady of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Dr Grace Mugabe," she said. On Saturday, Mrs Mugabe had been due to take part in the first ladies' programme at the Southern African Development Community heads of state summit in Pretoria, which Mr Mugabe, 93, was attending. However, she failed to show up. South African police had said they wanted to interview Mrs Mugabe and had set up a "red alert" at the borders to try to ensure she did not leave the country. But Zimbabwe's ZBC state broadcaster reported that President Mugabe and his wife "arrived on board an Air Zimbabwe flight early on Sunday morning". It showed pictures of her greeting officials at Harare airport. Ms Engels' lawyers have said their client was offered money to drop the case but she refused. She appeared at a press conference on Thursday with a large plaster on her forehead. She has alleged that Mrs Mugabe beat her with an extension cable at the hotel where the model was staying with Mrs Mugabe's two sons. She told the BBC: "She hit me with the plug and the extension cord. And I just remember being curled down on the floor with blood rushing down my face and down my neck." The South African Broadcasting Corporation said the Mugabes were scheduled to attend a funeral for a state minister at Harare's Heroes Acre on Sunday.	South Africa has granted diplomatic immunity to Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe, allowing her to leave the country without answering questions about an assault allegation.
National League club Forest Green Rovers stopped selling meat burgers in 2011 and in July took fish off the menu to become fully vegetarian. Cow milk has been replaced with soya or oat milk to rid the Gloucestershire club's menu of all animal products. The move is inspired by the club's chairman, who is himself a vegan. It is the final step in his vision for the club to go vegan, which means excluding products such as dairy, eggs and honey. Chairman Dale Vince said: "The gap between vegetarian and vegan food is actually quite small; it's a step rather than a leap to take. "A lot of our food has been vegan for some time now, and this season we've taken the last small step." The Nailsworth-based club's timely transition to veganism follows the World Health Organisation (WHO) report on Monday which linked processed meat consumption to cancer. Mr Vince added: "As the WHO report this week makes plain, meat is bad for human health, being a major cause of cancer. "Making these facts plain and demonstrating what a plant based diet looks, and tastes like, is an important part of our work." Mr Vince, who is the founder of the wind turbine company, Ecotricity, has also made other eco-friendly moves to improve the club's sustainability. This has included fitting solar panels to its stadium roof, and making an "organic" pitch by avoiding the use of chemicals. In July, the club also announced plans to create a multi-million pound green technology centre near the M5 motorway.	A football club is claiming to be the world's first to adopt a vegan match day menu after removing cows' milk from its hot drinks.
Jamie Bishop, who was 44, was a left-handed batsman who also represented Wales at minor county level. Glamorgan cricket club chief executive Hugh Morris described him as "a hugely talented cricketer" who had an outstanding record for Pontarddulais cricket club. South Wales Police is not treating the death as suspicious. Tributes were also paid on social media, from sporting figures including Steve James, Edward Bevan, Sean Holley, John Devereux and Rick O'Shea.	Tributes have been paid to a former Glamorgan cricketer who was found dead at his Swansea flat on Friday.
14 February 2017 Last updated at 08:20 GMT It's part of a celebration of the re-opening of the Settle to Carlisle line in Cumbria which had to be closed after landslides damaged the railway line. Tornado, the steam train pictured above, will run two return journeys a day between parts of Cumbria and Yorkshire from the 14 to the 16 of February. The company which owns the trains think they will be pretty popular!	For the first time in more than 50 years a steam train will be running a regular service in England, but only for three days.
They are among seven ex-News of the World staff accused of conspiracy to access voicemails. Prosecutors say the charge could involve about 600 victims. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, facing four counts relating to specific people, was also at the Old Bailey. A 9 September 2013 trial date was set. The former staff members from the now-defunct News of the World newspaper who are also facing trial are its ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, former news editor Greg Miskiw, former head of news Ian Edmondson, ex-reporter James Weatherup and former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck. As well as a general conspiracy to unlawfully intercept communications charge, other charges relate to specific people. Mr Coulson was News of the World editor from 2003 to 2007 and Mrs Brooks edited the paper from 2000 to 2003, before moving on to edit the Sun and then becoming chief executive officer of the two papers' parent group News International. Mr Kuttner was excused from attending Wednesday's hearing. The provisional trial date was set for 9 September next year and all defendants were released on bail. In a separate case, Mrs Brooks, 44, from Churchill in Oxfordshire, her husband, Charlie, and five others  appeared before the court accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Mrs Brooks's chauffeur Paul Edwards, former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, head of security at News International Mark Hanna, and security staff Daryl Jorsling and Lee Sandell also face the charges. They relate to an alleged attempt to hide evidence from police investigating phone-hacking claims and illegal payments to public officials by the News of the World and the Sun.	Former News International boss Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson have learned their trial over phone-hacking claims will take place next September.
Royal Mail said the rise of delivery firm Whistl could wipe £200m off sales. It also said competition was endangering its government-mandated Universal Service, which guarantees a single price postal service that delivers to all UK addresses. The caution came as Royal Mail reported a small fall in pre-tax profits. They dropped to £218m for the six months to 28 September, from £233m in the same period last year. In its financial statement, Royal Mail named Whistl, formerly known as TNT, as a direct threat to future profits. The company also said it faced increased parcel competition and that Amazon's recently-launched delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as 2%, in the short term. In the past six months, Royal Mail's UK parcel delivery division saw revenues fall by 1%. However the firm's international parcel delivery service, GLS, fared well, with revenue up 7%, helping the company's overall revenue to rise by just £5m to slightly above £4.52bn. Royal Mail's letter business saw volumes drop by 3%, although this was not as steep a fall as had been expected. The slower decline was due to election pamphleteering, particularly relating to the Scottish Referendum, for which Royal Mail delivered seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene told the BBC that increased competition was threatening the company's ability to deliver letters to all parts of the UK - a service mandated by law. She added that the "cherry-picking" of urban mail routes by competitors "undermines the economics" of its nationwide delivery service. Royal Mail has long called for the regulator, Ofcom, to consider expanding the Universal Service mandate - which ensures mail is delivered across the UK, six days a week, at one fixed price - so that it includes rivals such as Whistl. That may include forcing competitors to also deliver letters to rural areas at an affordable price - a service for which companies can make little or no profit. "We believe the current regulatory framework does not fully address the problem posed by unfettered direct delivery competition," Royal Mail said. "We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future." In response, a spokesman for Ofcom said the regulator's own evidence "clearly shows that the service is not currently under threat". "We would assess any emerging threat to the service quickly, in the interests of postal users," he added. Royal Mail has been under increased public scrutiny since it was privatised in October 2013. In July, a group of MPs voiced concerns that the taxpayer may have lost out by about £1bn after Royal Mail shares were "undervalued". After an initial pricing of 330p, Royal Mail shares rose above 600p in the months after its flotation, but have been steadily declining since the early summer, to 430p. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor Lurking on page 8 of today's numbers is the real story in Royal Mail's results - that the business is warning of a "material risk" to the Universal Service obligation. Some may dismiss this as special pleading from a company that does not much like competition. But I have just spoken to the Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, and she is clear - if action isn't taken now, Royal Mail's ability to fund the six day letter delivery service across the UK will come under possibly unmanageable strain. "The threat is now," she told me.	Shares in Royal Mail closed down 8.3% after the firm warned that rivals - including Amazon - were eating into its parcel delivery business.
The animal welfare charity received a call saying there was an injured or possibly dead snake at Green Street Park. It said the caller had been "too scared" to get any closer. SSPCA animal rescue officer Coreen Hill said it was "always better to be safe than sorry." She said: "I expected to be met with an escaped corn snake that had been attacked by a cat or dog, but instead I discovered it was made of plastic. "The caller believed they had spotted a snake in the distance whilst at the park and was too scared to get any closer to investigate. "They could only tell that it wasn't moving and had its mouth open. "This job can be very tough as we deal with severely injured animals on a daily basis, so it's quite nice when something like this makes us smile."	The Scottish SPCA was alerted by a member of the public to a snake in Forfar only to discover it was a plastic toy.
Mr Walsh, on a visit to Ulster University in Belfast, said: "Without question, it will be an advantage." He would prefer that the UK abolishes Air Passenger Duty (APD). But, in its absence, he said carriers within his International Airlines Group (IAG) would "certainly look at what is on offer" from Stormont. Economy Minister Jonathan Bell has promised a decision on an air route development fund by the end of next month. Potentially, it could be a Â£4m incentive package to help fund important business and tourism connections. The Northern Ireland Executive could, on its own, scrap all APD, but it would cost it at least Â£55m to repay the Treasury in lost tax revenue. Mr Walsh - a long-standing critic of APD - said it was "unfair to ask Stormont to make up the gap", adding "the chancellor should pay for it." He also expressed potential interest in Bombardier's new C-Series aircraft, which has struggled for orders and put the company under huge financial strain. He said the smaller version - the CS100 - "is possibly an option" for his airlines operating at London City Airport. "People will watch its introduction into service (later this year)," he said. "If it can demonstrate it is not just a good aircraft on paper then it will get more interest."	A Stormont fund to attract new air routes has the backing of Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

Chief executive Karl Koehler is standing down and his replacement will not have a position on the main Tata board in Mumbai, unlike Mr Koehler. Tata is making 1,050 people redundant, including 750 at its Port Talbot site. Community organiser Rob Edwards said he was surprised by Mr Koehler's departure and what it meant for the future. "I think it compounds the recent news about the redundancies. You start to ask questions about long-term investments," said Mr Edwards. "There is an element of doubt, we walk a path of uncertainty," he told BBC Radio Wales's Wales at Work programme. He added that he wasn't concerned about the short-term commitments made by the company as it tries to save Â£300m as part of its current survival plan. He said the union was worried that the move weakened the voice of the European operation when it came to decisions being made by the board in future. Workers from Tata marched through Brussels with Mr Koehler and steelworkers from across Europe demanding that the EU take action on the price of Chinese imports. New chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, Hans Fischer, takes over on 1 March. Koushik Chatterjee, the group executive director for finance and corporate affairs, will add responsibility for Europe to his role on the Tata Steel board in Mumbai.	Changes at the top of Tata Steel Europe raise doubts about the "long-term investment" of the company, according the steelworkers union, Community.
Remains of a man aged between 30 and 49, were found close to the M54 motorway in Shropshire, in August. West Mercia Police said two metal bracelets - including one thought to be a Kara, a Sikh symbol - were found inside a jacket that was also uncovered. There have been no matches with DNA profiles of missing people in England. The force said it was still unable to ascertain the cause of death, but it was keeping an open mind as to how the remains came to be at junction four of the M54 at Shifnal. It is understood the remains lay undiscovered for up to three years. 2 - 3 Years the bones of a nearly complete skeleton belonging to a man had lain at the site, next to junction four of the M54 5 7 - 5 11 Height of the man 30 to 49  Years old at the time of death Detectives said they could not rule out that "he may have been subjected to a crime". The man, who was between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 11ins tall, was discovered by a highway worker at the bottom of an embankment. He was wearing a black "dare2be" soft-shell outdoor jacket in a large size, a navy blue V-neck T-shirt from George at Asda and a pair of dark coloured, medium-size Nike tracksuit bottoms. Police said that specific type of T-shirt was first manufactured in November 2007 and first sold in March 2008.	A full DNA profile has been developed of a man whose near-complete skeleton was found close to a motorway.
Former champion Murray has never played Broady, the world number 234 who has received a wildcard to the tournament. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. Compatriot James Ward, also a wildcard, will play defending champion Novak Djokovic in his opening match. In the women's singles, British number one Johanna Konta faces Puerto Rican Monica Puig, while Serena Williams will face a qualifier or lucky loser. Sixteenth seed Konta, ranked 18th in the world, has met Puig once. The Australian Open semi-finalist came from behind to win 4-6 6-4 7-6 at last year's grass-court tournament in Nottingham. British number two Heather Watson starts against Annika Beck and could then face top seed Williams in a repeat of last year's gripping third-round match, while Laura Robson has drawn Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber. Robson and Kerber have met three times, including at Wimbledon in 2011. The Briton won in three sets then, but Kerber has triumphed in the other two matches, the most recent in Beijing in 2013. Media playback is not supported on this device In the men's draw, Murray is in the more favourable half and would only face Djokovic or third seed Roger Federer in the final. Djokovic and Federer are scheduled to meet in the semi-finals. If Ward overcomes Djokovic in round one, he could play countryman Kyle Edmund in round two. Edmund takes on Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. The highest seeds in Murray's half of the draw are Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Richard Gasquet. Frenchman Gasquet, a semi-finalist last year, will play British number two Aljaz Bedene in his opening match. Women's singles: Naomi Broady v Elina Svitolina (17) Katie Swan v Timea Babos Tara Moore v Alison van Uytvanck Men's singles: Dan Evans v Jan Lennard Struff Brydan Klein v Nicolas Mahut Alex Ward v David Goffin (11) BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: Murray won't be looking too far ahead - he was taken to five sets in his opening two matches at the French Open - but a fourth-round match with Nick Kyrgios on Centre Court could be fraught with danger. It could be considered an advantage for Murray that Federer is in the other half of the draw with Djokovic, but the seven-time Wimbledon champion, 34, has played little tennis in recent months. Robson's draw suggests her recent luck is showing no sign of improvement, while Konta will have her work cut out to live up to her seeding. She could face the 2014 runner-up Eugenie Bouchard in the second round and former Australian Open runner-up Dominika Cibulkova in round three.

Officials from Cuba and Norway, the two countries brokering the peace process, said a week of discussions would begin in Havana on 10 December. Colombia's president stopped the talks after the rebels seized Gen Ruben Dario Alzate and two others on 16 November. The captives were released on Sunday. They were handed over to a humanitarian mission led by the International Red Cross and taken to a military base near the city of Medellin before travelling to be reunited with their families. "We consider the crisis over and announce that we have agreed that the next cycle of conversations will take place between 10 and 17 December," Reuters quoted a joint statement read by a Cuban official as saying. The negotiators said the next round of talks would focus on a de-escalation of the conflict, and on meeting the relatives of victims. They also said the parties had agreed to establish a permanent system to deal with any future crises. They will reconvene around mid-January, on a date not yet determined. The negotiations have been under way in Havana since November 2012 and aim to bring an end to five decades of conflict, in which 220,000 people are estimated to have died. The Red Cross and the Farc said that the handover on Sunday had taken place in a remote location in Choco province, an isolated jungle region on Colombia's Pacific Coast. Gen Alzate, Cpl Jorge Rodriguez and lawyer Gloria Urrego had been kidnapped 14 days earlier while travelling along the Atrato river by boat. They had ventured into territory dominated by the Farc in civilian clothes and without a security detail. The Farc said they kidnapped the general because they were unhappy that President Juan Manuel Santos had continued military operations against them during peace talks. The left-wing rebel group has renewed calls for both sides to call a ceasefire while the peace negotiations proceed. The government has rejected such calls, saying that a truce would only help the rebel group regroup and rearm. Gen Alzate resigned from his post on Monday, saying he should have taken more security precautions.	The Colombian government and Farc rebels have agreed to resume peace talks, which were suspended last month over the abduction of an army general, mediators say.
Peers were due to resume line-by-line scrutiny on 9 February but that has now been put back until 22 February. The Scottish government wants a deal concluded by 12 February to allow time for it to be examined at Holyrood. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has informed Holyrood's Devolution Committee of the delay. The negotiations on the fiscal framework - the financial arrangements underpinning the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament - have proved both protracted and complicated. The Scottish government has said there is still "some distance to go" before a deal can be agreed and threatened to veto any formula that was "unfair to Scotland". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned recently that Scotland stood to lose billions of pounds over the next few years under the Treasury's current proposals. Talks between the two governments are due to resume in Edinburgh on Monday. In a letter to Holyrood's Devolution Committee, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The fiscal framework talks are continuing, and I am optimistic about the process. I am doing everything I can to secure an agreement which is durable and fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK. "All through the process we have made time for these issues to be properly considered and discussed, and that remains the case. "I want to ensure both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Lords have as much information as possible for their consideration. It has been agreed, therefore, that the next parliamentary stage of the Scotland Bill will be rescheduled. "This will allow more time for negotiations between the Scottish and UK Governments to progress. I am confident both parliaments will have the opportunity to properly consider the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework before the Scottish Parliament's dissolution on March 23." Deputy First Minister John Swinney responded to Mr Mundell's letter, promising the Scottish government would do "all we can" to secure an agreement. But he added: "We will not sign up to any proposed agreement which short changes Scotland by locking in long-term cuts to our budget. "We are working to a deadline of February 12th for talks to be concluded because the Scottish Parliament requested this, as members need time to properly scrutinise and vote on an agreed fiscal framework package before it is dissolved next month ahead of May's election - but we will give all the time possible to secure a deal." Earlier the Treasury minister negotiating on behalf of the UK government said he was "confident" a deal would be reached. Greg Hands said he had cleared his diary for a full day of talks in Edinburgh next Monday and he remained "upbeat" that an agreement would be struck. What is the fiscal framework? He told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee: "I'm ready to deal. I'm off to Edinburgh on Monday and I remain upbeat on that possibility. "The UK government remains committed to getting that deal." An agreement would set out how Scotland's annual block grant from the Treasury will be adjusted to take account of the new tax powers. Mr Hands insisted the proposals will provide "huge new opportunities" for the Scottish government to grow the economy. The deal must be "fair to taxpayers in Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK", he told the committee. Mr Hands said: "Neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be better or worse off as result of the initial act of devolution. "Thereafter, the Scottish government should bear the fruit of good policy decisions and the consequences of poor policy decisions." The committee chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, warned that Mr Hands and Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney appeared to have "very different perspectives" on the long-running negotiations. "There does seem to be some distance to go in terms of getting an agreement on this," Mr Wishart said. Scottish Labour had earlier called for the 12 February deadline to be abandoned, and said neither side should walk away until a deal is reached. The party has criticised a lack of transparency in negotiations and called on minutes of meetings to be published. Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: "Over the past few days we have seen the negotiations descend into a blame game. "People across Scotland will not understand that after the negotiation for more powers, this deal could fall apart at the last minute."	The Scotland Bill's passage through the House of Lords has been delayed while wrangling over the fiscal framework continues.
It's a virtual reality headset which when worn will allow gamers to experience a virtual gaming world. It won't be cheap though, it's being sold for Â£549 and you'll need a very powerful computer to even be able to use it. Similar products on the market include HTC's Vive VR headset which was launched earlier this year and Sony will be releasing it's own virtual reality headset called the PlayStation VR in October. Earlier this year Ricky got to try out the Oculus Rift and some of it's accessories.	The Oculus Rift is finally available to buy from high street stores and online in the UK, six months after it was released in the US.
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: "Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years." There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. "For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists," Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. "I could never have imagined that." The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians "to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.	Journalists have been accused of treason; a chief prosecutor fired; and we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of government ministers scrambling to get out of the firing line after popular outrage.
Are those voices being heard when it comes to the election? Courses to help young people get into work are held at the Spectrum Centre on the Shankill Road in Belfast. Among them is 18-year-old Donna Rennie who said she would "love to get a job". "I've applied for loads but it doesn't work, there's always somebody better," she said. "It's not a nice feeling." It's a feeling Marc Young knows only too well. "I went to school, got my GCSEs and A-levels and I thought I would walk into a job but I haven't," he added. "I've applied everywhere and just haven't heard back which is really frustrating." So what is the answer? What should the politicians be doing? William Glass has been in and out of jobs for the past two years since leaving school at 16. "Why not spend the time, the four years in school, training for a job or career that you want to be in? "Then more people are going to have the skills they need for the job. "I want a career, I don't want to be going from job to job." Thomas McKeown is looking for a job in youth work and he feels frustrated when he watches what happens at Stormont. "I feel the politicians today are just so bitter-minded about wanting to get one up on each other," he said. "How long do we actually want this to go on? It's been going on long enough." William agrees: "I believe there are people in Stormont who are stuck in the past and fighting. "For me, that era is truly over. "I want to see people using legal highs to get help and I want to see drug reform and better health care." And Dylan Bell believes the politicians need to be more visible when it isn't election time. "You see the politicians round your door every day for a month and a half," he said. "Then the rest of the ten and a half months you see them on the news and that's it - they're more worried about being on the big screen."	Almost one in five young people are unemployed in Northern Ireland, according to latest figures.
The takeover sees 100% of the club's shares and assets transferred from previous owner Steve Morgan to Fosun in a deal thought to be worth £45m. In an open letter to supporters, Morgan said Fosun had "made a commitment to invest between £20-£30m over the next two years" into the club. Chief executive Jez Moxey will also step down after 16 years at Molineux. Wolves, who had been put up for sale by Morgan in September 2015, are the second Championship club to have Chinese owners after Midlands rivals Aston Villa were sold to Dr Tony Xia earlier this year. The new-look board at Molineux will consist of four members, including Jeff Shi, who led the negotiations on behalf of Fosun and will become the club's representative, while local businessmen and Wolves supporters John Bowater and John Gough will also continue to serve as non-executive board members. Moxey will remain as chief executive for the next three months as the club, which finished 14th in the Championship in 2015-16, search for a permanent replacement. "We are delighted to have completed the deal to become the new owners of such a famous and historic club as Wolves," Shi told the club's official website. "We owe a great debt of gratitude to Steve Morgan for taking such good care of the club and for placing his trust in us to become the new custodians of Wolves. "During our conversations Steve's great passion and vision for the club and Wolverhampton was very clear and we feel privileged to pick up the baton from him. "And also to Jez Moxey for his tremendous contribution to Wolves. We are sad to see him leave." Shi continued: "We would also like to thank the hugely loyal and passionate Wolves supporters, and all of the club staff, for their patience whilst our discussions were ongoing. We hope they will be pleased with, and supportive of, our exciting plans for Wolves. "Our goal is crystal clear: we will do our very best to help take Wolves back to the Premier League as soon as possible and to stay there. "We believe the club and the fans belong at the top of English football and getting there is our first and top priority." Under the chairmanship of billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, Fosun are one of the largest investment groups in China. They have stakes in various leisure and entertainment projects around the world, including Club Med and Cirque du Soleil, and currently have interests in several UK companies including Thomas Cook. Fosun also has links with super-agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo among others. Mendes sold a minority share of his agency Gestifute to a subsidiary of Fosun late in 2015 and is expected to play a part in recruitment at Wolves. I don't think there's any significance in the West Midlands suddenly appearing to be the hotbed of Chinese interest as far as English football's concerned. Two factors have combined - the Chinese government encouraging its big economic players to get involved in European football and the stagnant state of the top West Midlands clubs. Since Aston Villa's League Cup win in 1996 only Birmingham City have won one of English football's major trophies, beating Arsenal to win the same competition in 2011. Too many false dawns, too many disillusioned owners. A regional powerhouse stagnating. Enter the Chinese on the wave of a massive interest in football, with their own Super League prospering, serious players being lured by fabulous contracts and TV coverage of English football soaring in scope. The president has said he wants the World Cup staged in China within 20 years. The onward march into English football - and stakes in Atletico Madrid and AC Milan - is just one manifestation of that long-term aim. The money is available to snap up these West Midlands clubs. Other bidders are just being blown out of the water by Chinese money.	Championship club Wolves have confirmed that they have been bought by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International.
Previously, Mr Jones warned Wales was "unlikely to consent" to a deal unless certain conditions were secured. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it was "ultimately a decision" for Prime Minister Theresa May. Mrs May has said she wanted the Welsh Government to be "involved and engaged" in the negotiations. During a trip to Chicago last week, Mr Jones said talks would fail if it "becomes a two-way dialogue between Brussels and London". He said all four of the UK's parliaments and assemblies should have to "agree to any deal the UK government comes to". Mr Jones said he could not "envisage consent being given by Wales" unless access to the European Union's single market and protection for the rights of citizens from other EU countries were secured. The call was interpreted by some as a threat to block a future Brexit deal. But speaking to the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Mr Jones said he "never called for a veto". He said: "What I have said is that I think it's right that all four parliaments should ratify, agree to any deal the UK government comes to. "It wouldn't be right for the UK government to negotiate in terms of farming and fisheries when they have no role in farming and fisheries in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. "If the UK government want to get as much support as possible across the UK for any potential deal, they're going to have to seek support in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well." Mr Cairns said it was ultimately a decision for the UK government's cabinet and the prime minister. "The prime minister has tasked me to look after Wales' interests and in doing so I will engage with the first minister but the first minister will also want to engage with other administrations around the UK as well as with the UK government," he said. "We will come to a view that serves the whole of the United Kingdom and it's my job to make sure that Wales is absolutely at the centre of those discussions." Asked what he thought were Wales' priorities in the Brexit negotiations, Mr Cairns said: "It's about making sure that immigration controls are appropriate, that meets the needs of the community in Wales but also of Welsh business. "It's about access to the markets and ensuring, of course, that we've got access to the new markets that are emerging. "Australia, New Zealand, India, north America, Singapore - they've all indicated positive discussions. That will be so important to our future prosperity and trade opportunities."	First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he never called for Wales to veto the UK's future Brexit deal.
Bu farw Sophie Taylor, 22, ar ôl i'w char daro bloc o fflatiau yn ardal Adamsdown ym mis Awst y llynedd. Cafwyd Melissa Pesticcio, 23 o Lanrhymni, yn euog o achosi ei marwolaeth trwy yrru'n beryglus, ac fe gafodd ei charcharu am chwe mlynedd a hanner ddydd Gwener. Cafodd Michael Wheeler, 22 o Dremorfa, oedd wedi cyfaddef i'r un cyhuddiad, ei ddedfrydu yn Llys y Goron Caerdydd i saith mlynedd a hanner mlynedd dan glo. Roedd Pesticcio hefyd wedi ei chael yn euog o achosi anafiadau difrifol i Joshua Deguara trwy yrru'n beryglus - teithiwr yng nghar Ms Taylor. Fe wnaeth Wheeler, oedd wedi bod mewn perthynas â'r ddwy ddynes, hefyd gyfaddef achosi anafiadau difrifol trwy yrru'n beryglus a chyhuddiad o fygwth. Clywodd yr achos bod Pesticcio wedi dilyn Sophie Taylor yn ei char ar hyd strydoedd y brifddinas ar ôl ei gweld tu allan i gartref ei chariad, Wheeler. Roedd y ddwy wedi ffraeo'n gyson ar ôl i Wheeler adael Pesticcio am Ms Taylor, ond aeth Wheeler yn ôl at Pesticcio yn ddiweddarach. Yn dilyn anghydfod dros arian, dilynodd Pesticcio a Wheeler y ddynes ifanc drwy strydoedd ardal Adamsdown. Roedd car Vauxhall Corsa Wheeler yna wedi "gorfodi" car BMW Ms Taylor i mewn i wal, gan achosi ei marwolaeth a gadael Mr Deguara gydag anafiadau oedd "wedi newid ei fywyd". Roedd y tri char wedi gyrru'n gyflym drwy strydoedd Caerdydd, gyda lluniau camerau cylch cyfyng yn dangos car Pesticcio ar y blaen, gyda Wheeler yn ei dilyn y tu ôl i gar Sophie Taylor. Roedd Wheeler wedi gyrru ar ochr anghywir y ffordd ddwywaith er mwyn gyrru'n nes at gar Ms Taylor. Gyrrodd i mewn i'w char, gan olygu ei bod wedi troi allan o reolaeth i mewn i wal y bloc o fflatiau. Bu farw Ms Taylor ac fe ddioddefodd Mr Deguara anafiadau difrifol gan dreulio "misoedd lawer" yn yr ysbyty.	Mae dynes a'i chariad, wnaeth achosi marwolaeth dynes arall mewn gwrthdrawiad wrth ei dilyn ar hyd strydoedd Caerdydd, wedi eu dedfrydu i gyfnodau sylweddol o garchar.
There are pubs where they play music and then there are pubs where music takes a more prominent role. Sometimes, however, there are pubs where drinking seems almost a sideline to the main business of musical appreciation. Walking into Sandy Bell's in Edinburgh, you feel it sits very firmly in the latter category. Long a focus for the Scottish traditional music scene, recent years have seen more performances, bigger audiences and some very talented players. And as far as many are concerned, that tells you something about Scotland today. "There's more pride in Scotland generally," says Archie, a smiling accordion player from Skye. "You'll get pubs that used to be trendy pubs, with CDs playing, and now they have folk music sessions." For Sam, who plays violin, it's a particular source of pride that so many visitors from abroad now seem captivated by the melodies of her native land. "You've got tourists from Canada, Australia, America, Japan, China. I've always liked this sort of music. It does make me feel like I'm celebrating being Scottish." In a week when Scotland's First Minister unveiled plans for a possible second referendum on independence, the strength of nationalist sentiment has usually been gauged by polls. And much to the frustration of Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, support for independence has barely budged from the 45% who voted for it in the previous referendum of 2014. Yet many believe that Scots now have a far stronger sense of their country's distinct identity, a sentiment that polls seem to miss. Among them is Henry McLeish, the Labour First Minister of Scotland from 2001-02, who extols what he believes are Scotland's particular qualities. "We're more internationalist, we're more open to immigration," he says. It is the Brexit vote and its aftermath that has done more than anything else to shift his opinion. The majority of Scots voted to remain in the European Union, in contrast to the UK vote to leave. "I was a diehard unionist. Politics has changed, I've had my Britishness squeezed out of me. It's more in sorrow than in anger that I am ready to say that I could support an independent Scotland." Michelle Ferguson is not sorry about her increasingly strong sense of being Scottish, but it has come as something of a surprise. Once an employee of a large multinational, she used to live in London and described herself as British. But Michelle has now become managing director of a social enterprise, St Andrews First Aid Supplies and Training, which ploughs all its profits back into the local community. The experience seems to have changed her sense of identity, as much as her attitude to business. "Here in Scotland, people really want to make a difference, it's not all about the big bucks," she says. "I now feel that if I had to fill in a form… I would have to say I am Scottish." Michelle does not want to say whether she voted for Scottish independence, nor whether she would do so in the event of another referendum. And the fact is that whatever resurgence of Scottish pride there may be, the Scottish National Party has so far failed to capitalise on it. But then the Party has always been keen to emphasise the alleged economic benefits of independence, rather than playing the identity game and appealing to voters' "tartan blood". "A vote for independence should not just be about how we feel, although that is important," says Ben Macpherson, an SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament, representing Edinburgh North and Leith. Yet pushed on the issue, Macpherson agrees with the suggestion of growing national self-awareness, and hints that it might help his cause. "Scotland is an increasingly more confident country than when I was a child. More and more, Scotland is starting to understand that Scotland is ready to govern itself."	The Scottish Government has published a bill outlining provisional plans for another referendum on Scottish independence, plans which some believe coincide with a renewed sense of Scotland's separate identity.
An employee of the credit card company Nets was also convicted. Leaks provided by IT expert Peter Bo Henriksen to the Se og Hor weekly magazine enabled it to report a series of royal family and celebrity stories, to the bafflement of its rivals. The case has attracted huge public interest in Denmark. Judge Mette Lyster Knudsen sentenced Mr Henriksen - who used to work for Nets - to 18 months in jail for selling information between 2008 and 2012 that detailed the location of major public figures including Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and actor Mads Mikkelsen. Former Se og Hor editor Henrik Qvortrup was also sentenced to 18 months in jail, of which 12 were converted into 200 hours' community service. Three other Se og Hor journalists were given suspended sentences, while another was acquitted. All have since left the weekly, which has one of the biggest circulations in Denmark. Among the stories reported by the magazine were details about the honeymoon of Prince Joachim and his wife in Canada in 2008, after it bought information about their itinerary from Nets. The media group that owns the magazine was fined $1.52m (Â£1.22m) last year for wrongfully monitoring more than 120 celebrities. Two former senior staff members were given suspended sentences. One of the celebrities who fell victim to the magazine, Rene Dif of the Danish-Norwegian music group Aqua, criticised the sentences on Thursday. "These short sentences shows how ridiculous the Danish justice system is," he told Danish TV. The four journalists have said they are considering an appeal against the verdict.	Four Danish journalists have been found guilty of paying for credit card information to track politicians, celebrities and royal family members.
The 22-year-old played for Yeovil in the 2012-13 season and briefly last term, but has been studying at Rider University for the past four years. "I'm incredibly excited to be back playing for my hometown club who I have supported my whole life," she said. "To have the opportunity to play for them in the top division is amazing." Howard graduated two weeks ago with a major in history and a minor in French.	Women's Super League One side Yeovil Town Ladies have re-signed goalkeeper Beth Howard after she graduated from university in the United States.
Police said the firework was dropped through the doorway of a fish and chip shop by an "unknown male". The incident happened at about 21:15 BST on Friday at the shop in Alliance Avenue. The man was taken to hospital where he is described as being in a stable condition. Condemning the incident, North Belfast SDLP assembly member Nichola Mallon said: "Fireworks aren't toys, they can cause serious injury and they can cause considerable damage to property and they need to be used responsibly. "So I would send a very clear message to parents and to young people to realise the dangers of fireworks." Sinn FÃ©in councillor JJ Magee said: "Hopefully the injured man will make a full and speedy recovery but it must have been a very traumatic experience." Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.	A man has suffered burns after he was hit by what police have described as a "large firework rocket" in north Belfast.
Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed was "the day that all your nightmares came true". Mr Lock was attacked on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing last July. Earlier defence counsel David Howker QC said Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mr Daley's family for having "failed" him in his care and treatment. Mrs Daley told the court her son had many debts and the recent breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend had left him "distraught". "We were never provided with a proper diagnosis. We were frequently in meetings but we were not listened to," she said. "It's been continual over the last 10 years. In the past 10 years we have pleaded to people, it has been on a regular basis." Mrs Daley told the court the apology from the NHS trust was "10 years too late". She said she feared her son was involved in the killing in Findon when she saw the news on television. When she failed to contact him she drove to the stables where he worked and saw his damaged car. The court heard the family decided to go to Worthing police station and as Mrs Daley was about enter, her son called her saying: "I need to know where you are and that I can trust you." Mr Daley also told her he had done "something really bad or something really wrong. "I killed someone." The court also heard Mr Daley police told a police officer "when I drive, people try and break into my thoughts". He also said: "It's sad that I had to kill someone who was so aggressive to me when I wasn't aggressive at all." Mr Lock was returning from a cycling meet when he was stabbed 39 times during a "ferocious" attack on the A24 at Findon in July. Witnesses have described Mr Daley as being "expressionless" during the attack, as though he was "having a passport photo" taken. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of Mr Daley's Ford Fusion and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Jurors have been told that Mr Daley's defence team will claim the defendant may have been acting in self defence because Mr Lock was angry and aggressive . Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey said Mr Lock died from a stab wound to the aorta. Stab wounds may have also also been inflicted when the 79-year-old lay dead or dying. The case continues.	The mother of a man who stabbed a motorist 39 times told a court she "pleaded" with mental health experts to have her son sectioned.
The Scot, 26, stopped Joubert in the sixth round - a ninth win out of nine. "I had to [get] over the clash of heads and cut in the first round," he told BBC Scotland. "It's a pretty nasty cut. "I learned I can deal with having to get cuts and when it gets rough I can carry on with it. I kept myself nice and calm." The 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games gold medallist has previously stated his ambition to fight fellow Scot and WBA super-lightweight champion Ricky Burns. Taylor's promoter, former world champion Barry McGuigan, said: "We'd love that fight. That's a great fight, that's a magnificent fight down the line. "He [Taylor] is impressive. He's so inventive. He's creating his own little style. Taylor has got that uniqueness about him, he's just so inimitable in everything he does. "He's great to watch and he's definitely going to go the whole way. The difficulty for me now is how do I fill the gap between here and world championship fights because that's where he's capable of going? "I need to have something else in the middle because once you make that step, there's no turning back. You can't go back and have easier fights where you can gain experience. That's my dilemma." And Taylor added: "I'm quite happy where I am just now, maybe another defence of the Commonwealth, maybe even knock on the door of the European [title]. "I learned a lot about myself [against Joubert]. I was impressed with my own performance. "I caught him clean a few times and he took them and he came back at me and hit me a couple of times himself. "Once I started finding my range, started catching him with good shots, it didn't take me long once I caught him clean."	Josh Taylor says he "learned a lot about himself" in his Commonwealth super-lightweight title defence against South Africa's Warren Joubert.
Birmingham winger David Cotterill's deflected shot was the closest either side came in the first half but Bolton goalkeeper Mark Howard kept it out. Lukas Jutkiewicz missed a good chance for the hosts in the second half, heading off target from a corner. Gary Madine's header forced Birmingham goalkeeper David Stockdale into a one-handed save in the latter stages. Harry Redknapp brought new signing Isaac Vassell off the bench for his debut following his arrival from Luton on Monday but the striker could not break the deadlock. The draw is the second in a row for Phil Parkinson's Bolton, while Birmingham have four points following a win and a defeat in their first two games. Birmingham boss Harry Redknapp: "I couldn't see us winning and I was looking for the final whistle. I couldn't say that I enjoyed the game. "It was almost the same team which struggled to stay up last season and that is a big worry. "There is ambition in the club to get in some quality otherwise it is going to be another tough season." Bolton manager Phil Parkinson: "In open play I thought we had the better chances. Darren Pratley had a good opportunity, while Adam Armstrong produced two good efforts. "All round I can feel the team is growing in confidence at this level. We looked fit and strong and that is important. "The concentration level was also excellent. The signs are very promising on this performance against a strong Birmingham side." Match ends, Birmingham City 0, Bolton Wanderers 0. Second Half ends, Birmingham City 0, Bolton Wanderers 0.

Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a "failed" project. Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development. So, is Bitcoin doomed? Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned. Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin. In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin "mining". Users have a "bitcoin address", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used. Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts. Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead. The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed. The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin. As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing. Indeed, some transactions face significant delays, hampering payments. Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable. Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years. In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time. He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network. Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB. But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted. He later wrote, "It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable." The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MB There are alternatives, however. Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB. Bitcoin's history as a "decentralised" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature. Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation. Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers. Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say. "This is a matter of perspective," he told the BBC. "The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world." However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted. "I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology," Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC. Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added. Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog. One bitcoin is now worth $380 (Â£265), down from about $430 on Thursday. However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015. But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year. Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security. Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred. Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many. Bitcoin remains popular. There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data. It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight. But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head. Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen. Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt. But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet. Update: This report was changed on 19 January 2016 to clarify that some payments can take a considerable time to be processed rather than not going through at all.	A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development.
Several thousand people who lived at the camp were moved to new homes around France last week. However, around 1,500 children still remained living at the camp in temporary shelters. A week after the demolition first begun, these children have now been taken to special centres around France where they can be properly processed. But why were these people being made to move? And why were they in Calais in the first place? The jungle is situated at a place called Calais, which is on the north coast of France, right near to the UK. Many thousands of people travelled across Europe and arrived at Calais in order to try to cross the English Channel to reach the UK, where they believed they could live a better life. This is because Calais is one of the main ports for travelling from France to England, with lots of vehicles, ships and trains that travel to England from here. However, the refugees were being stopped at Calais before they could complete the last part of their journey, as they are not allowed to simply enter the UK without going through an official process. This means they had to set up temporary homes at Calais. As a result, the jungle had become home to thousands of people, desperate to finish their journey and make a new start in the UK. Earlier this year, authorities in France announced plans to close the camp and an area of it was cleared. However, the final demolition of the Jungle shelters has now been completed. The authorities did this because they did not believe it was a situation people should be living in, and they needed to find a better solution. People had been living in very poor and dirty conditions. Furthermore, there were reports of violence and trouble in the camp, meaning it wasn't always a safe place for people to live. Local people in Calais had also been campaigning for the Jungle to close down, as they did not want it in their area. Many of those living in the Jungle had been making desperate attempts to reach the UK quicker, by jumping onto lorries that are travelling to England. This is extremely dangerous and is also illegal. The thousands of people who lived in the camp have been made to leave their temporary homes behind. Thousands of migrants have been taken to official centres all over France, where the authorities say the living conditions will be better. Once they arrive there, French officials will register them and decide where they will go to live after this. One of the big problems which the authorities faced when trying to sort out the refugees with new homes was the fact that many children travelled across Europe - and were living in the Jungle - on their own. Around 270 children who have relatives in the UK - or who were considered to be particularly in need of help - have been brought over to the UK to be looked after here.	The French authorities have been carrying out the demolition of one of the biggest refugee camps in Europe known as the "Jungle".
Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale. A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers. "The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid. It will be done on Tuesday," he said. In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside. Macquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover. Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta. While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn. With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry. Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces. Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country. A management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited. It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board. The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available. Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers. Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.	Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.
The man named as Abdalfatah HA is suspected of being part of a unit with an al-Qaeda-linked group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which killed 36 Syrian government employees in 2013. The federal prosecutors' office said the man, arrested in Duesseldorf, had carried out death sentences. A second suspected al-Nusra fighter was arrested in the town of Giessen. Abdulrahman AA is accused of breaking international weapons laws. Both are thought to have been part of the same combat unit for al-Nusra, which was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria at the time. The group formally severed its ties to the global jihadist network last year, renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. In January, JFS merged with four smaller groups to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. German prosecutors allege Abdulrahman AA, 26, and Abdalfatah HA, 35, took part in an armed battle against Syrian government troops including taking over a big arms depot near Mahin, central Syria, in November 2013, eight months after the murders of the government employees. Some local reports have claimed one of the men was an asylum seeker, but a spokeswoman for the prosecutors' office refused to confirm this.	A Syrian national has been arrested in Germany accused of war crimes involving the murder of dozens of civil servants.
Spokesman John Kirby said the two officials - who have not been named - were told to leave on 17 June. Mr Kirby said that earlier that month, a Russian policeman attacked the US diplomat near the US embassy in Moscow. "The action was unprovoked," he said. Russia said the diplomat worked for the CIA and had refused to show ID papers. Last month, US officials said harassment against US diplomats  by Russian security and intelligence services was on the rise. Russia has denied the allegation. "On 17 June, we expelled two Russian officials from the United States to respond to this attack," Mr Kirby said on Friday. He said this was in response to the attack on the US diplomat on 6 June. The assault happened after the accredited American official had identified himself to the policeman, Mr Kirby said. "The action was unprovoked and it endangered the safety of our employee. The Russian claim that the policeman was protecting the embassy from an unidentified individual is simply untrue." Russia said earlier this week that the US official was a CIA agent who had refused to provide his identification papers and hit the policeman in the face. "Instead of the CIA employee, who was in disguise, as we understand, it could have been anyone - a terrorist, an extremist, a suicide bomber," Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Russian media have also released a video of what they say was the scuffle between the US diplomat and the Russian policeman. Last month, the US said it had raised the issue of the alleged harassment of US diplomats in Russia directly with President Vladimir Putin. Washington said the problems began two years ago after the US - as well as the EU - imposed sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and its ongoing involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Specific incidents have not officially been revealed. But the Washington Post said last month they included breaking into the homes of embassy staff, rearranging furniture and even killing a family pet. No official response has been made by Russia but a statement to the Post did not deny the charge and said there had been US provocation against Russian diplomats. The former US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, told the newspaper that while his family was living in Moscow, they were routinely followed by security services that wanted him to know they were being watched.	The US has expelled two Russian diplomats in response to an attack on an American diplomat in Moscow, the state department says.
Celtic and Dundee are exploring the possibility of staging a game in the US, where the Kilmarnock striker has experience with Portland Timbers. "I think there are avenues for the Scottish game to tap into if you look at the American model," said Boyd. "But, for our teams to go there to play, I don't think it's right." A formal proposal is set to be put before the Scottish Professional Football League regarding the Dundee v Celtic match in the next few weeks, with Boston and Philadelphia possible host cities. "It's not for me," Boyd, 32, told BBC Scotland. "With the two of them being Scottish clubs, it's right that they play in Scotland. "It's obviously a big market for Celtic with them being a worldwide club and because Dundee's owners are American, that's why they'll be trying to explore it. "There's a lot of Scottish people living in America. There is interest. "But the majority of Dundee fans will be from Dundee. I don't imagine there'll be a lot in America. With Celtic, there will be. That comes with the size of the club." Boyd spent 2012 in Major League Soccer, scoring seven goals in 22 starts for Portland. "Scottish clubs can go over and see what's going on and try and make things better but bring it back here to try and make the Scottish game better in Scotland," added the former Scotland international. "Football is definitely getting bigger [in the US]. "The majority of clubs are now playing in front of 20,000 every week. Seattle are playing in front of 60,000 - that's as big as Rangers and Celtic! "There's more to take into it - the travelling, the different climates, the time zones. It's a difficult place to go and play football. "And they change the rules every year as well to suit the teams that are struggling because if you win the league then players' wages might go up then the next thing they need is to trade their players to keep themselves under their salary cap. "It would be difficult to manage in and definitely be an owner in but the flipside is that if you're an owner and you're getting 20,000 every week, you know you're still making money."	Kris Boyd believes Scottish football can learn from the United States but is against the idea of playing Scottish Premiership matches overseas.
It would make the disused Fawley power station chimney the tallest such attraction south of London's Shard. Developers Fawley Waterside said it would be the centrepiece of a "merchant city" development. The power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation. Architects plans show a petal-shaped glass structure at the centre of a Â£1bn development featuring a marina, housing and restaurants. It also includes fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth. With an application for outline planning permission due later this year, building could start in 2018. The oil-fired Fawley Power Station, on the western side of Southampton Water, was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes. The 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016. Aldred Drummond of the company said: "We'd be mad to knock the chimney down - its our signature piece of infrastructure. "If you think of the money spent building the i360 in Brighton, or the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, this building is already there so with relatively little investment we can do something very spectacular." 1971 Commissioned on the western shore of Southampton Water 2,000 megawatt oil-fired power station fuelled by nearby Esso refinery 198 metre-high chimney dominates the Solent sykline 1,100  miles of cable were laid within the power station One million homes were powered by Fawley	A 650ft (198m) power station chimney could be converted into a public viewing tower and restaurant overlooking the Hampshire coast, under plans released by developers.
Two hundred and sixty people have already been convicted. The officer in charge of Operation Titan, Det Supt Sean Wright, appealed for anyone taking part in planned protests later this month to do so lawfully and peacefully. Operation Titan was set-up to investigate public order-related incidents since 12 July. Police released the figures at a press conference at PSNI headquarters in Belfast on Monday. ACC Will Kerr said 2013 had been a challenging year for policing. He said the last four years had seen a severe dissident republican threat, however recently there had been an upsurge in activity. In relation to the loyalist paramilitary group, the UVF, ACC Kerr said that elements of the group, particularly in east Belfast, had been involved in a range of criminal activity, however the issue of respecification was a political decision.	Police have said 560 people have been charged or reported in connection with flag protests in Northern Ireland.
Weaker commodity prices and consumer spending, together with a slowdown in its key trading partner, China, has hurt growth. Towards the end of last year, however, the economy expanded by just over 5%, boosted by government spending. President Joko Widodo had promised to lift annual growth to 7% on average. However, the country has seen an average of just under 6% growth over the past decade and analysts have said growth is unlikely to improve for some time. "The fourth quarter data is a positive surprise," economist Tony Nash told the BBC. "But unfortunately the uptick will likely be short lived. We expect deterioration in the first quarter and it'll be tough to regain growth momentum before 2017," he added. Mr Widodo made his promise to raise growth when his five-year term began in 2014, but he has faced problems boosting government spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed. A $5.5bn high-speed railway project, funded by China, was signed last year and is scheduled to be up and running by 2019. But the project has faced widespread objections from transport experts and its long-term viability has been questioned. Mr Widodo has also faced international condemnation for the country's man-made forest fires, which have caused serious economic and environmental damage. In December, the World Bank said Indonesia's forest fires last year had likely cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 Aceh tsunami. In its quarterly report, the bank said the fires had cost some 221tn Indonesian rupiah ($15.72bn; Â£10.5bn). It added that regional and global costs would be much higher.	Growth in South East Asia's largest economy, Indonesia, has come in at 4.76% for 2015, marking the fifth consecutive yearly decline.
Rhiannon Smith, 21, was involved in a collision between a black Range Rover and a grey Toyota Yaris on the A48 between Newport and Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on 16 March. The trainee teacher, from Llandevaud, has since died. Her family said she was "the life and soul of a party" and had ambitions to work as a teacher in London. The Cardiff University graduate was finishing her PGCE at the University of Gloucestershire and had been applying for jobs in England's capital when she died. In a tribute, her family said: "Her enthusiasm for teaching was difficult to match. She had recently said that she was having the happiest time of her life and thanked her family for enabling her to achieve these wonderful goals. "Rhiannon was the life and soul of a party and left a mark on everyone she met. She was such an integral part of the Smith household and will be sorely missed, never forgotten and impossible to replace."	A "wonderful young lady" has died after being involved in a two-car crash on a main road.

Media playback is not supported on this device Rogers needed 14 stitches in his lip after a challenge by Tyrone's Tiernan McCann at the start of the game. "I think Brendan was quite shocked. Some people were quite horrified," said the Derry manager. "I'll leave it to other people to make up their minds." The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks. Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in. After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made. "Brendan has been very quiet about it and we have been very quiet about it as well," said Barton after Derry's opening 3-13 to 1-10 Division 2 Football League victory over Fermanagh at Celtic Park. "It was quite an horrific incident. I wouldn't like to expand on it to be quite frank. Media playback is not supported on this device "It was an incident that thankfully you don't see very often." Barton added that he "couldn't speak" after the game such was his upset about the incident. "I think it affected the mood of all of us. "It overshadowed for me what was a positive night for football. "I think the amount of respect that was shown between Derry and Tyrone was very evident but it's one of those things I'll let people make up their own minds about." In terms of Sunday's opening league win, Barton felt that his team had laboured badly in the first half before going on to clinch a nine-point victory over the Erne County. "We were very flat at the start of the game. We turned over a serious amount of ball under no pressure. "I was glad to see our first goal going in (before half-time) and I was very happy to see half-time because it gave us an opportunity to restructure and talk about what we felt we were going wrong. "Getting in the ball in early in the second half to our men inside worked nicely in the inclement conditions but we'll have to up our performances over the next couple of weeks."	Derry football manager Damian Barton has described the facial injury sustained by his player Brendan Rogers in last weekend's Dr McKenna Cup final as "horrific".
Mr Newman was detained in Melbourne on Thursday after entering Australia without a visa. Australia had cancelled his visa while he was still in the US on the grounds that his presence in the country could incite violence. Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and said women who have abortions are murderers. On Friday, Justice Geoffrey Nettle in Melbourne ruled that the cancellation of Mr Newman's visa was justified, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While Mr Newman may have had a case to challenge the cancellation, he should not have boarded a plane to Australia without a visa, said the judge. "Acting as he did means he does not come to this court with clean hands," he said. Mr Newman, also known as Troy Newman-Mariotti, had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia. But he was prevented from boarding a connecting flight in the US city of Denver on Tuesday after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton cancelled his visa. It came after it emerged he had called in a 2000 book for doctors who perform abortions to face execution . His wife Mellissa had presented his appeal to the high court in Melbourne. "I don't know what they're afraid of. I don't know what they think he's going to do here," she was quoted as saying earlier by ABC News. In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa "was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence". "My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself," he said. Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an "anti-choice extremist". But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that he "has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change".	US anti-abortion campaigner Troy Newman is to be deported from Australia after losing a high court appeal.
The 25-year-old from Plymouth, who also dived at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and 2009 World Championship, has quit after a "I just feel like my body is telling me to give up," the 10m platform diver told BBC South West Sport. "I'm 25-years-old and knowing there's another four years until Rio, I just don't think my body will hold out." My dream, even as a little girl, was to make an Olympic Games. Not making London was heartbreaking and my dreams were shattered Graddon, who won a bronze medal at the 2009 European Diving Championship in Turin, cites 2008 as the best year of her career as a diver. She said: "I'd come back from injury and illness and that year I was British champion and qualified for the Olympic place for Great Britain, although I didn't make Beijing." Graddon, who trained alongside Tom Daley and Tonia Couch in Plymouth, says her biggest regret is never being selected for an Olympics, after also missing out on a place at London 2012. "My dream, even as a little girl, was to make an Olympic Games," she added. "Not making Beijing was sad and I was gutted not to make it, but I thought 'head down, London's in four years'. "But not making London was heartbreaking and my dreams were shattered. "I knew I probably wouldn't make Rio, so it was horrible and the worst feeling not getting what I wanted, but that's sport."	European bronze-medal winning diver Brooke Graddon has announced her retirement from the sport.
The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887. The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown. Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town. Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before. Mr Young, said: "We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist. "This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted. "Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled." Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres. Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition. Mr Young said they were a "poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war". After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works. He died aged 47 in 1936. From Dark to Light: exploring the life and art of Victor Noble Rainbird is on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre from 10 July to 6 September.	A collection of paintings capturing the landscapes and legacy of life on the North East coast is going on display.
The first earthquake near Dingxi city had a magnitude of 5.98 and was shallow, with a depth of just 9.8 km (6 miles), the US Geological Survey said. Just over an hour later, a magnitude 5.6 quake hit the same area, it added. In 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan province left up to 90,000 people dead and millions homeless. A factory worker in Minxian county told AFP that he felt "violent shaking" and "ran to the yard of the [factory] plant immediately". "Our factory is only one floor. When I came to the yard, I saw an 18-storey building, the tallest in our county, shaking ferociously, especially the 18th floor," he said. The area has been hit by 371 aftershocks, according to the Earthquake Administration of Gansu province. Tremors were felt in the provincial capital, Lanzhou, and as far away as Xian, 400km (250 miles) to the east. At least 5,600 houses in the province's Zhangxian county are seriously damaged and 380 have collapsed, while some areas suffered from power cuts or mobile communications being disrupted, the earthquake administration added. "Many have been injured by collapsed houses," a doctor based in Minxian county was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. "Many villagers have gone to local hospitals along the roads." The earthquake has caused a direct economic loss of 198 million yuan ($32m; Â£21m), the Dingxi government said on its microblog. Both the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang had called Gansu province to express their concern for the victims and stress the importance of the rescue operations being conducted well, the Dingxi government added. Crews of fire fighters and rescue dogs have already arrived at the scene, the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing reports. In pictures: Quakes aftermath The closer to the surface an earthquake strikes, the more damage it can cause, our correspondent adds. The earthquake reportedly triggered a series of mudslides and landslides, making it difficult for rescuers to access some areas hit by the quake. The Gansu military police have deployed 500 soldiers, including 120 specialist rescuers, while 500 emergency tents and 2,000 quilts are also being transported to affected areas, Xinhua added. Officials from the civil affairs, transportation and earthquake departments were also visiting local towns to assess the damage, a statement on the Dingxi party website said. Rain is expected in the region later, leading to fears that this will make rescue efforts more difficult, or cause more landslides. "Showery weather is expected tomorrow, and lighter rain the day after that. The rain may have an adverse effect on rescue efforts - please pay attention and be on guard!" the Dingxi government wrote on its microblog. Residents in towns near the earthquake also reported feeling the tremors. "You could see the chandeliers wobble and the windows vibrating and making noise, but there aren't any cracks in the walls," AP news agency quoted a clerk at Wuyang Hotel, about 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre, as saying. "Shop assistants all poured out onto the streets when the shaking began," the clerk said.	Two powerful earthquakes have struck China's north-west Gansu province, killing at least 75 people and leaving more than 400 others injured.
Chris Erskine crossed low for Kris Doolan to tap home and give the Jags an early lead. Adam Barton and Steven Lawless came close to doubling the hosts' advantage. After a poor first half Well carved out chances to score in the second, Zak Jules's header kept out by goalkeeper Tomas Cerny. Media playback is not supported on this device With one more round of fixtures to play before the Premiership splits in two, Thistle have a seven-point gap over Kilmarnock and will face Celtic, Aberdeen, Rangers, St Johnstone and Hearts in the final few weeks of the season. Before then, they will visit Rangers next weekend, when Motherwell host basement side Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Having come from a goal down to beat Ross County last week and drawing away to champions Celtic on Wednesday, Thistle's confidence was high and they were in a hurry to make that count. Doolan scored both goals against County - his 100th and 101st for the Jags - and the striker marked being captain for the day with a simple finish off Erskine's ball across from the left. Barton's free-kick drifted narrowly past the left-hand post and Lawless's shot was deflected on to the crossbar. And Doolan should have got Thistle's second following an incisive pass by Ryan Edwards, the striker firing across the face of goal from the right of the six-yard box. Other than an early Scott McDonald header that was blocked out for a corner, Motherwell failed to seriously trouble their hosts in the opening period. Manager Stephen Robinson needed a reaction in the second half and sent on Keith Lasley and Lionel Ainsworth in place of Elliott Frear and Craig Clay. Shea Gordon flashed the ball across goal but the stretching McDonald could not apply the finish, Cerny clawed away Jules's header and Lasley's effort did not trouble the Jags goalkeeper. A late scramble in the box did not provide the telling shot at goal the visitors needed as Thistle held on, leaving Motherwell four points above Inverness and below Lanarkshire rivals Hamilton Academical on goal difference. Lawless dragged a shot wide after driving at the Well defence but Alan Archibald's side struggled to create as many openings in the second half. But one goal proved to be enough to ensure they will claim their highest top-flight finish since 1981. They had been bottom of the division in December, a couple of months after Archibald stayed at the club following an approach by Shrewsbury Town. He will now have the chance to get Thistle even higher in the Premiership with only three points separating the Jags from Hearts. Match ends, Partick Thistle 1, Motherwell 0.

Leading man Leonardo DiCaprio won best actor in a drama, while Alejandro G Inarritu won for its direction. Ridley Scott hit The Martian was named best comedy or musical film, winning a further Globe for star Matt Damon. Room star Brie Larson was named best actress in a drama, while Jennifer Lawrence won best comedy actress. British winners included Kate Winslet, picking up the best supporting actress award for her role in Steve Jobs, as the Apple guru's assistant; singer Sam Smith, for his Bond track Writing's On The Wall, and the BBC's adaptation of Wolf Hall was named best mini-series. But hopefuls Eddie Redmayne, Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Maggie Smith and Idris Elba missed out. Mark Rylance, who - like Elba - was nominated in both the TV and film categories, was tipped to win the best supporting actor Globe for his role in Bridge of Spies, but lost out to Sylvester Stallone for his comeback performance as Rocky Balboa in Creed. "I was here in 1977 and I was hit by tumbleweed - and the view is so beautiful now," said Stallone, who received a standing ovation. Steve Jobs picked up the award for Aaron Sorkin's screenplay - making the biopic the only other multiple film winner of the night. There were no awards for Todd Haynes's critically acclaimed love story Carol, nor for the much admired Spotlight. There was also nothing for George Miller or his Mad Max reboot Fury Road, nor did The Big Short or The Danish Girl make good on any of their nominations. As widely predicted, Pixar's Inside Out won best animated film and veteran Italian composer Ennio Morricone won his third Golden Globe for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. In the television categories, the streaming services' original dramas Mr Robot and Mozart in the Jungle won awards. Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal was named best actor in a comedy or musical TV series for his role as brash conductor Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, and Christian Slater won the best supporting actor in a series for Mr Robot - shutting out British star Damian Lewis (Wolf Hall) and Alan Cumming (The Good Wife). Having missed out on an Emmy in September, Empire star Taraji P Henson was named best actress in a TV drama series and Mad Men's Jon Hamm picked up his second best actor Golden Globe for Mad Men - eight years after winning his first at the start of the series. But, in an otherwise disparate night, the evening belonged to Alejandro G Inarritu's survivalist tale The Revenant - and the combined power of Inarritu's direction and DiCaprio's visceral performance. The victory comes just a year after Inarritu lost the best director prize to Richard Linklater, when Inarritu's Birdman faced off with Linklater's Boyhood - though Inarritu went on to win the Oscar. It must also put DiCaprio centre stage for the Oscar that has eluded him throughout his career. "This has been the most difficult journey I have embarked upon," said Inarritu, receiving his award. "But we all, in this room, know pain is temporary - but a film is forever. So who cares?"	The Revenant has triumphed at this year's Golden Globes, winning the night's most coveted prize for best dramatic film.
The 21-year-old member of parliament is named alongside Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift and Noel Gallagher for the publication's People of the Year list. NME said the politician impressed by becoming the youngest MP elected to the House of Commons since 1880. Earlier this month, she was named Glasgow University's Young Alumnus of the Year. Ms Black won the Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat in May's general election, before completing her MA Hons degree in Politics and Public Affairs.	SNP MP Mhairi Black has been announced as one of music magazine NME's People of the Year nominees.
At the trial in the town of Douai, the prosecution had asked for an 18-year term for Dominique Cottrez, 51. The defence had argued that the former health worker should be acquitted because of her troubled mental state. Cottrez earlier confessed to suffocating her children after giving birth secretly at home near Lille. She then buried the bodies in the garden of her parents' home and at her own home nearby in Villers-au-Tertre. The former nursing assistant had previously said she had a long incestuous relationship with her father and that she feared each baby might be his. However, during the trial she did not talk about the relationship. Cottrez, who is obese, also said that from a young age she had battled with her weight and was mocked by other children at school. She apparently managed to conceal her pregnancies from everyone, including her doctor and her husband, because of her obesity.	A court in northern France has sentenced a woman to nine years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies between 1989 and 2000.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was shot dead at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand on Wednesday. Police believe two men shot him several times in the head and chest at point blank range before running off. The BBC understands the 53-year-old was one of a number of suspects in the murder of Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May. Sinn Féin has denied speculation that Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder. The DUP said there will be "repercussions" if that is the case. Mr McGuigan, a father-of-nine, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said Mr McGuigan was killed by two masked men using semi-automatic weapons in a "professional, execution-style killing". Appealing for information, the officer leading the murder investigation said the gunmen were on foot and wearing dark clothing with their faces covered. "We need to hear from anyone who has information about the events of last night, about the movements of the gunmen both leading up to and immediately after the shooting," said Det Ch Insp John McVea. Mr McGuigan had been questioned by police after the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast three months ago. Mr Davison, 47, was a former IRA commander and a former friend of Mr McGuigan. The IRA pair were also founding members of the paramilitary group Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), which killed more than a dozen alleged drug dealers. They were later involved in a feud, and Mr McGuigan was shot several times in a so-called punishment attack. It was claimed that Mr Davison gave the order for that attack on his former friend. Det Ch Insp McVea said police were "aware of speculation around a possible motive" for the murder of Mr McGuigan. The detective said that in the investigation into the murder of Mr Davison, Mr McGuigan was questioned "as a potential witness, not a suspect", and this was still the police's position. "Speculation is not helpful and is potentially dangerous," he said. "People should allow the police investigation to take its course and provide any information they have to detectives." However, the police officer did not go as far as entirely ruling him out as a suspect. "I am saying the investigation team into the murder of Jock Davison would remain open minded as to who is responsible," he told a news conference. The detective also appealed for "those with influence in the community to use all their efforts to reduce tension and appeal for calm and restraint at this very difficult time". The victim's elderly mother, Margaret McGuigan, told the BBC that her son's killers would have to live with what they had done. She added there had been "too many murders" in the area and that she hoped her son's would be the last.	A former Provisional IRA member murdered in front of his wife was shot dead in a "ruthless and premeditated killing", police have said.
The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground. Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World. It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades. "It's thrilling," said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who. "Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible." The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s. However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes. In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos. The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive. Mr Morris said: "The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria. I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who. When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special." He said it had been a "lucky" find given the high temperatures in the African country. "Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition." Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive. The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story. Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever. Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered. Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday. The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97. One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm. Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield. Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton). The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea. The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system. "It's the quintessential Doctor Who story," said Gatiss. "It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location." He said it showed Troughton "at the height of his powers". Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret. The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers. Recalling Troughton's "wonderful sense of humour" on set, Watling said: "We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle.  We had a chemistry and I think it showed." How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? "I couldn't quite believe it. There had been hoaxes before. I thought it was just another hoax." Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991. Hines said: "This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork." The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.	Nine missing episodes of 1960s Doctor Who have been found at a TV station in Nigeria, including most of the classic story The Web of Fear.
Last week's news that Nigeria's Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, wants all new recruits to the country's police force to undergo a lie detector test cannot have been an April fool's joke as it's now the end of August. A police statement stated clearly that the "polygraph test is aimed at ensuring that candidates are not of questionable character", and that new police officers should "conform to acceptable standards necessary for an ideal police officer the Nigerian people deserve". Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's former finance minister: "Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM" Just what sort of questions would be set for the future cops is not clear, but the move is innovative and opens up all manner of possibilities on the African political landscape in our search for the kind of public officials the continent deserves. And why stop at just police recruits? Journalists could be asked: "Have you ever taken money to write or ignore a story?" Football players in the Under-17 World Cup could break out in a sweat at the simple inquiry: "How old are you?" Politicians and presidents, meanwhile, may find the truth-telling exercise a challenge too far. The search for honest police officers who fulfil the "acceptable standards" sought by Nigeria's police chief could be extended to most African states. Back in July, citizens in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, vented their anger over phony police roadblocks, which crop up every few miles "to check the roadworthiness" of vehicles, but more importantly provide a pretext to spot-fine drivers and extract money from impoverished commuters. And since the state is struggling to pay public workers, it is entirely credible that such fines exist to supplement the officers' meagre and late salaries. "Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM," declared Tendai Biti, former finance minister. Encounters with African police forces can also be deadly. Ethiopian police clashed with demonstrators demanding answers to human rights abuses in the north-west of the country, and several people lost their lives in the city of Bahir Dar in the Amhara region. Farai Sevenzo: "Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse" Force is the default setting for African police, with officers deployed on the streets willing to unleash tear gas in Nairobi, Harare, Lusaka, Addis Ababa or any other African capital. Anti-government demonstrations in Harare last week saw water-cannon and yet more tear gas as the government blamed unknown "foreign elements" for trying to incite rebellion. In the age of instant news and social media sharing, the evidence of African police brutality is a click away and all over the web. So, would a polygraph test for new recruits lessen such incidents? What kind of questions would the recruits have to answer? Would there be questions about their sympathy for the beaten citizens? Or would they be about their loyalty to entrenched police chiefs who have had jobs for life, much like the men who appointed them? As governments face dissent, citizens are promoting the idea that those police officers firing live bullets into groups of demonstrators, or starring in their own brutality videos as they rain down truncheon blows on fleeing citizens, should be recorded, identified and have their details stored for future prosecutions. Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse. Whatever becomes of the Nigerian inspector general's intriguing idea to introduce lie-detector tests, he should remember the double-edged nature of such an exercise. The polygraph reveals the truth-tellers and may show him honest cops who pass the test, but it will also give him the best liars who will bluff their way through anything. More from Farai Sevenzo:	In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo questions whether lie detectors could help promote honest law enforcement.
"The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country," said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would exercise congressional functions. The charge stems from alleged electoral irregularities by three opposition lawmakers in elections in 2015. The head of the OAS Luis Almagro accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of carrying out what he described as a coup against itself. Brazil's foreign ministry said the court's decision violated the country's separation of powers. Several other Latin American countries expressed concern too. Peru recalled its ambassador to Caracas, saying there had been a rupture of democracy. The United States also condemned Venezuela's government. "This rupture of democratic and constitutional norms greatly damages Venezuela's democratic institutions," said a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner. Venezuela's opposition had earlier said President Maduro was becoming a dictator. Venezuela's foreign ministry accused critics of the government of forming a right-wing regional pact against President Maduro. He says the OAS is a pawn of US "imperialism".	There has been growing criticism of Venezuela's government after the Supreme Court took over legislative powers from the National Assembly.
The Miscarriage Association, which came up with the figure, wants people to open up about baby loss to break what it calls "the last taboo". One mother has gone a step further and filmed the aftermath of her miscarriage for a documentary, to challenge the secrecy surrounding it. Lisa Francesca Nand, from Greenwich, has suffered five miscarriages in total, including one the day before her 12-week scan. "One minute I was pregnant, we were planning the future and thinking about being a mummy and daddy. Then suddenly, in the space of a few hours, we were no longer going to be parents, it was heartbreaking," she says. The experience made her determined to share her story. One scene shows her husband David waiting outside the hospital while she has the remains of their second unborn child removed from her body. "They had sent me home to pass the sac. It took a week of walking around with a dead baby inside me for it to come out. And I bled for six weeks afterwards. No-one talks about the physical pain, so I didn't expect it. "I started filming a video diary because no-one talks about it. I want people to understand they are not alone, " adds Lisa, who has since gone on to have two healthy boys. So why are miscarriages still shrouded in mystery? Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, thinks it is because of the "rule" that women should not announce their pregnancy before their first scan. "Most miscarriages happen in the first three months. If you don't tell people you are pregnant then sadly you are not going to get the support that you need when you are grieving. It doesn't suit everyone to talk about their pregnancy before their scan, but it can help. "We don't tell people 'in case something happens', but that can reinforce the idea that you should keep it a secret if you miscarry," Ms Bender Atik said. The reason behind a miscarriage is often unclear - leaving women with no one to blame but themselves, she adds. "Most women never find out why, so they think it must be their fault, and this is very a dangerous path to go down." Family and friends might not know how to react, and can make things worse with insensitive comments, according to Ms Bender Atik. "We want people to say things like 'I am so sorry for your loss' and 'do you want to talk about it?', rather than 'don't worry, you will be pregnant again soon," she added. My own miscarriage happened earlier this year, at nine weeks in to my first pregnancy. I noticed some light bleeding and was sent to Colchester Hospital for a scan. My husband and I were overjoyed to catch the first glimpse of our tiny baby, with a strong heartbeat pulsing furiously away on the screen. Only a few friends and family members knew that I was pregnant, and we rushed round to show them the photos of our beautiful baby. But 24 hours later we were sat in the same chair, being told that our precious baby had gone. Sitting in the car park crying, we tried to make sense of what had happened. My husband told me through tears that all he had ever wanted was to be a father, and I felt like I had let him down. We had planned to tell his parents that evening over dinner, so we still made the trip up north and kept our restaurant reservation. We sat in shocked silence for most of the journey, playing songs that I have not been able to listen to since. Telling them we had miscarried felt even harder, because they had never known the joy of my pregnancy in the first place. In the following days, I began to blame myself. It must have been the heavy camera kit I had stupidly picked up at work. Or perhaps it was the rum I drank on an all-inclusive holiday before I knew I was pregnant. My husband was hugely supportive throughout, but I found myself pushing him away, telling him that he did not understand how it felt. I made him put the baby books and maternity clothes I had foolishly bought in the loft, because it was too painful to look at them. How naÃ¯ve I was to buy them, I berated myself, looking at the nursing chair in the corner that I knew I would not sit in. I talked about getting a tattoo because I felt like I had nothing to show for being pregnant, as if it had never really happened at all. One of my best friends told me she was pregnant and was due at the same time as I would have been, and I hated myself for not feeling happy for her. "I'm really lucky that I didn't need to have an operation, some people have much worse miscarriages," I kept telling friends and family, to make them feel better. But inside I felt like the unluckiest person in the world. I went straight back to work because my colleagues did not know, and on the first day I had to attend an inquest about a dead baby. But this is completely normal, I told myself. After all, no-one talks about miscarriage. Six months on, I have realised three things. Firstly that men can suffer as much as women after a miscarriage, and if anything, this experience has made our marriage stronger. Secondly and probably most importantly, that it was not my fault. And thirdly, that miscarriage is so much more common than I had realised. I slowly started telling people and was amazed by how many confided that they too had secretly suffered this fate. I posted a message on Facebook saying I was writing this article and friends I had known for years got in touch, having never before shared their stories of loss. One said she had a miscarriage at work but felt like she had to hide because she did not want to tell her boss. Not a day goes by without another of my friends thinking about her babies and what they would have become. One friend sent me a note to say she was going through her second miscarriage at this very moment. Another said she could not tell anyone because she felt ashamed, like she had failed at the one thing women should be able to do. No-one should feel like this after a miscarriage. If it feels right for you, try sharing your story - you might be surprised by the reaction. First Heartbeat was first shown on 15 October at 10pm on TLC UK - and will be repeated on 17 October at 9pm, 19 October at 9pm and 28 October at 10pm.	As many as one in four pregnancies are thought to end in a miscarriage, and yet most women never talk about it.
Van Gaal, 65, has been out of work since being sacked by United hours after winning the FA Cup in May 2016. "I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching," Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ. He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football. He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month. "So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts," he added. The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East. Media playback is not supported on this device Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax. He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title. Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986. The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone. Media playback is not supported on this device He then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title. The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place. After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes. However, United replaced him with Jose Mourinho after just two years following a fifth-placed Premier League finish in the 2015-16 season, with a first FA Cup triumph since 2004 not sufficient to save him.	Ex-Manchester United and Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal says he has retired from coaching after a 26-year career.
U's captain Leon Legge struck what proved to be the decisive goal after 29 minutes, powering a header beyond Christy Pym from Piero Mingoia's free-kick. Exeter had earlier spurned a glorious chance to go ahead when Joel Grant blazed over after Ollie Watkins' shot was deflected into his path in space. Luke Berry almost made it 2-0 six minutes before half-time when a kick from goalkeeper Will Norris ran all the way through to him, only for his effort to land on the roof of the net before Norris produced a magnificent point-blank save to keep out Reuben Reid's header. Needing a result to solidify their own play-off spot, Exeter saw a Grant effort blocked by Legge and Lee Holmes volleyed well wide when a clearance fell to him. Eleven minutes from the end Norris made another critical save to parry a header from the unmarked David Wheeler to preserve the lead for Cambridge, who are a point from the top seven.

Axel Springer is one of  Europe's largest digital publishing houses, owning multimedia titles such as BILD, WELT, and FAKT. The company said Business Insider was "vital" in its strategy to broaden its global reach. Axel Springer, which failed to buy London's Financial Times in July, is paying $343m (£226m) for an 88% stake. Business Insider was launched in 2007 by the former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget. Its focus on younger audiences puts it in the same market as larger youth media outlets like Buzzfeed and Huffington Post. Adding Business Insider's 76 million visitors will increase Axel Springer's global audience by two-thirds, making it the sixth largest digital publisher. Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Doepfner said: "Henry Blodget's way of digital storytelling reaches the decision-makers of tomorrow.'' "The transaction is an essential component of Axel Springer's strategy to grow with digital journalistic offerings in English-language geographies". It lost out in its attempt to buy the Financial Times to the Japanese media firm Nikkei which paid £844m for the London based group. Axel Springer now owns 97% of Business Insider with the remaining shares held by Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, through a personal investment company.	German publisher, Axel Springer, has agreed to buy a controlling stake in the US news website Business Insider.
Ponds on the surface of the Khumbu glacier in the Himalayas have expanded and joined together to form larger bodies of water. Climbers need to cross the glacier, including the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, to climb the mighty peak. The accelerated meltdown of glaciers in the region is causing concern against a backdrop of rising global temperatures. Scientists say the warning is the first of its kind for Khumbu, although other glaciers in the Himalayas have seen an increase in the number of lakes formed. Such newly formed glacial lakes can overflow causing flooding, and with it loss of life and damage downstream. This is the first scientific team to visit the region after the devastating earthquake last April. "A decade or so ago, there were individual ponds on the Khumbu glacier but in the past five years or so they have begun to get larger and join up," said Ann Rowan, who led the field study team from the universities of Sheffield and Leeds. Dr Rowan's team has been studying the behaviour of debris-covered glaciers, focusing on Khumbu. "Particularly, on the left hand side of the lower reaches of the glacier, there is a series of about seven or eight large ponds that are now starting to link and form a big chain," she told the BBC. "There is water flowing from the upper part of the glacier through the series of these ponds and that is going to encourage them to join up. "At present, the glacier appears to be disintegrating, and may form a few large and potentially hazardous lakes on the glacier surface." Dr Rowan's team has studied satellite images of the Khumbu glacier dating back 15 years and has also conducted three ground surveys since 2009. The scientists found that parts of the lower region of the debris-covered glacier have been shrinking because of loss of ice underneath. This has allowed the formation and expansion of water bodies. The study says measurements for the past 15 years show that the surface of the debris-covered glacier has been declining at the rate of two metres per year. Unlike the usually smooth-iced glaciers elsewhere, many in the Himalayan region are debris covered, meaning they are coated by a layer of sand, gravel and rock. Scientists say since the upper parts of many Himalayan glaciers are losing ice mass due to rising temperatures. The supply of ice to the lower part of the glacier is therefore decreasing, causing the shrinkage. Other experts on debris-covered glaciers in the region say they too have also noticed similar developments "The surface lowering makes it difficult for the glacier to evacuate water from the surface past the large bounding moraines," said Lindsey Nicholson, from the University of Innsbruck. "The level of the runoff stream that cuts across the terminal moraines sets a 'base level' for the glacier's internal water table and it seems that rapidly coalescing lakes are usually associated with this water table." Hydrologist Jeffrey Kargel from the University of Arizona has been studying glacial lakes in the Himalayas for several years and said a pattern was developing. "The worrisome thing is that if the process continues, then there will be a new glacial lake to worry about in a populated and heavily used valley," he said. The Dig Tsho glacial lake in the Khumbu valley burst in 1985, destroying a hydropower plant and other infrastructure downstream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China over the past century. Records show ponds developed and drained on the Khumbu glacier in the past too but scientists say the rising temperatures and accelerated meltdown of glaciers in recent years is causing concern. "As the glacier continues to lower down, it gets more and more disconnected with the Khumbu Icefall, which means mountaineers could find it increasingly hard to climb," said Cameron Watson, a researcher with the Leeds University. While some members of the Sherpa community that inhabits the Khumbu valley are concerned, others say they are not worried. "We hear such alarmist reports every now and then," said Ang Kami Sherpa, the head of a Sherpa team known as ice fall doctors who fix the route on the Khumbu Icefall for climbers every year. "The ponds will come and go but as long as we keep our gods on the mountains happy, we have nothing to fear."	Lakes that have been forming near Mount Everest could threaten settlements downstream if they overflow.
Exports fell 2.1% compared with October, German's Federal Statistical Office reported, while imports rose 1.5%. Meanwhile, factory production fell by 0.1% from October as energy production fell and construction activity decreased. The latest news follows weak industrial order figures this week. "Things are certainly not rosy," said Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger. "The geopolitical situation, especially the Russia conflict and the related economic uncertainty, is limiting growth," On a seasonally adjusted basis, the country's trade surplus shrank to €17.7bn (£13.9bn) in November. Germany exported goods worth around €95.8bn and imported goods valued at €78.0bn in the month. In December, Germany's economic affairs ministry said the country's recovery was "progressing at a slow pace." This is a disappointing batch of German data. It pours cold water on hopes that the Eurozone's traditional economic powerhouse will drag its neighbours out of the gloom in the near future. The figures don't necessarily point to a renewed contraction in the German economy.  But they are consistent with no significant acceleration from the feeble 0.1% growth that Germany recorded in the third quarter of last year, following a contraction of the same magnitude in the previous three months. There were also declines in French and Spanish industrial production, adding another layer of gloom to the picture. These figures provide a little extra support to the view that the European Central Bank will embark soon on a major programme of quantitative easing - buying financial assets notably government debt with newly created money.	German exports and production fell in November compared with the previous month.
Thomas Bebbington, 22, from Shrewsbury, was last seen entering the river near the Dana Steps at about 19:20 GMT on 10 November. A body was found by a member of the public on private land near Leighton, about 10 miles (16.09km) away from the centre of Shrewsbury, on Monday. Mr Bebbington's family has been informed, West Mercia Police confirmed.	Police searching for a man who went missing last month have found a body on the banks of the River Severn.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
A Â£100,000 reward is on offer for information leading to the conviction of the killers of 14-year-old Charlene Downes or the recovery of her body. An appeal will be made on the big screen and inside programmes during the team's match against Brighton at Bloomfield Road on Saturday. Charlene disappeared near Blackpool's North Pier on 1 November 2003. Police believe she was one of a number of girls who were groomed for sex. Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said: "Someone out there knows something about what happened to Charlene. "Detectives believe the answer lies in Blackpool - and it could lie at Bloomfield Road on Saturday." Det Supt Andy Webster said: "We have never given up our search for information about Charlene, who we believe was murdered more than a decade ago. "We appreciate that a considerable amount of time has passed since Charlene went missing, but we would still encourage anyone with information at all to come forward and speak to us." In 2008, a judge ordered a man to be cleared of Charlene's murder, after "grave doubts" were raised around evidence during his second trial. The jury in his first trial failed to reach a verdict. The following year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said police errors in gathering evidence had contributed to the collapse of the retrial. The IPCC investigation concluded the investigating team was guilty of a strategic and tactical failure in the management of the material and several officers were disciplined, with one being forced to resign in 2011. The resignation order was overturned by a Police Arbitration Tribunal in 2012.	Blackpool football fans are being asked to help solve the murder of a teenager who disappeared over a decade ago.
Ryan Morse, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, died on 8 December 2012 from undiagnosed Addison's disease. Dr Leonard Peter told Cardiff Crown Court Dr Joanne Rudling, of Cardiff, did not ask enough questions about Ryan's condition hours before he died. She and Dr Lindsey Thomas, 42, of Tredegar, deny manslaughter. Dr Peter, who has worked as a GP for 41 years, told the court 46-year-old Dr Rudling, one of his GPs, should have shown more curiosity about Ryan's state. Zoe Johnson, defending Dr Rudling, put it to Dr Peter that medical notes suggested Ryan was "feeling a bit better from a temperature point of view" the day before he died, but still suffering from sickness and diarrhoea. She said Dr Rudling had offered him the chance to see a male doctor on Monday after she was told of a change in the colour of Ryan's genitalia, something she felt was a symptom of puberty. "Looking at the record I'd be concerned that a child had serious symptoms in the morning, sickness, delirium...and had now developed a symptom I'd never seen before (the skin colour change). "Doctors are curious, or at least they should be curious...and you can't risk manage it if you haven't seen it." Dr Peter replied. "She had a lot of this information in the records and nor did she seek the information that wasn't in the records. "She didn't take an overall view of what was happening...this was a 12-year-old whose mother was changing him (because of such severe diarrhoea). "Had she seen it, she wouldn't have thought it was puberty, she'd have thought 'I've never seen anything like this in my life.'" The court has previously heard Ryan's death could have been prevented if he had been examined at any point up until a couple of hours before it happened. Both doctors deny manslaughter through gross negligence. Dr Rudling also denies attempting to pervert the course of justice with an entry made in Ryan's medical notes two days after he died. The trial continues.	A GP should have been more curious about a 12-year-old boy's symptoms and seen him "as soon as possible" the day before he died, a court has heard.
Matt McKeown from Plymouth, south-west England, has created a super trolley with a motor and special wheels. And he's got it racing at 44 mph. The current speed record is 42 mph, so Matt reckons his trolley could have set a new world record. He says he'll contact Guinness World Records to see if it can be officially recognised. But he's not content with that - Matt says he wants to improve his trolley to try and reach a speed of 60mph instead! Check out the clip of it in action!	Imagine a shopping trolley that moves as fast as a car - well here it is!
Derby City Council wanted to shut Moorways Pool from April in a bid to save about Â£350,000 a year. The Labour-led authority, which needs to save Â£79m over the next three years, said it had found the savings by making cuts in other areas. Campaigners who gathered more than 4,000 signatures on a petition said they were delighted at the news. Ranjit Banwait, leader of the authority, said the council had committed to keep it open for a year. He said the council had identified savings "in back-office areas" and a restructuring of management jobs, which had been "untouched" since 2010. However, he stressed if the authority failed to get a "fair deal" from central government in the future, the pool would still have to close. Campaigners had accepted the pool, which is 33m in length, was in need of repair. There are plans for a new 50m pool to be built by 2018 to replace it. However, closing it would have left only one other public pool in the city - the Queen's Leisure Centre, they said. Doug Whitlam, of the Derbyshire Amateur Swimming Association, said: "One of the main things for me would have been the loss of teaching. "Twelve hundred young people use this facility every week and that would be lost forever."	A Derby swimming pool threatened with closure is to remain open for another year, council bosses have confirmed.
In an interview marking five years as first minister, Carwyn Jones said people accepted Welsh ministers were not "miracle workers" on NHS matters. He said Labour had "kept our promises" on health and other issues. But a Conservative spokesman said the "greatest threat" to Welsh public services was an Ed Miliband government. Discussing austerity, Mr Jones told BBC Wales: "If we see the Tory plans, we are going to have this until 2020. "I do not know what the NHS in Wales would look like by 2020, or the education services, if we see those levels of cuts. "We are just not going to be able to do what we all want to do, so I hope things will change or at least there will be hope in 2015." In relation to problems in the NHS, he said: "If you are straight with people and say 'look there are problems in some parts of the NHS, money is not there as it was five or six years ago', they accept that. "They know you are not miracle workers. "But what you say to people is, we have prioritised those areas we think are important and also, of course, we have kept our promises on health and other areas," Mr Jones added. A Welsh Conservative spokesman responded: "The greatest threat to Welsh public services is an Ed Miliband government increasing spending and borrowing, leading to crippling interest payments on the national debt, which would significantly reduce the money available to invest in schools and hospitals."	It is not known what the state of the NHS or education in Wales will be 2020 if the Conservatives win the general election, the first minister said.
The party won 33 seats on Thanet District Council, Kent, in May, making it the first authority in the UK to have a UKIP majority. UKIP councillor Jeff Elenor announced on Tuesday he was defecting to join the Democratic Independent Group. He joins four other UKIP councillors who defected last month saying they were unhappy with the council's lack of action over Manston Airport. They also said they were unhappy about what they felt was insufficient focus by the council on issues such as housing, mental health and disabilities. Mr Elenor said he did not feel the council was fulfilling its election pledge on Manston. In May, UKIP won 33 seats, the Conservatives 18, Labour four, and independents one - 29 seats were needed for a majority. UKIP now has 28 members, but remains the largest party on the council. Earlier this week, the US company seeking to purchase and reopen Manston Airport accused the council leader of holding up the process. The airport closed in May 2014 and was sold to a private consortium that plans to build homes on the site. RiverOak said it had offered the money to help with a compulsory purchase order (CPO), and in an email to the council leader, it accused Chris Wells of "throwing one road block after another in front of us in order for you to carry out whatever your real agenda might be". "Whatever it is, that agenda does not appear to recognise the will of your constituents, which is that Manston Airport be opened and operating at the earliest possible moment," chief investment officer George Yerall said. Mr Wells said the council was seeking further assurances that RiverOak could afford to purchase the site. The matter is due to be formally discussed at a cabinet meeting later this month.	The UK Independence Party has lost overall control of its only council.
Emergency crews were alerted to the blaze in Small Heath, Birmingham, at about 21:00 GMT on Monday. A spokesperson for Citroën and dealer Robins and Day said there were no injuries. Some cars have been burnt out. One lane of Small Heath Highway was closed while forensic investigations were carried out. More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country In a statement on its website, Robins and Day said the site was temporarily closed "due to an ongoing investigation and structural damage to the dealership". It added: "This site was in development and we remain committed to rebuilding and returning the site to full operation." A spokesman for Citroën and the dealership could not confirm how many cars were hit by fire or their value.	A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson after a fire broke out at a Citroën dealership.
Tall and like football? Go and play centre-back. Enjoy rugby union and have a bit of pace? Winger. Step forward Somerset's Dom Bess, who took 6-28 on his County Championship debut on Tuesday. How did he come to bowl off-spin? "I was always a little porker when I was younger, so I never took the long run-up," he said. "I always took five or six steps and just trotted in." Bess now has the best figures by a Somerset debutant for 55 years, since Tony Pearson returned 7-63 against Worcestershire in 1961, according to the Guardian. But any 'puppy fat' the 19-year-old may have had has long gone, with the help of strength and conditioning coach Darren Veness. "I met Daz and he made me run a lot, which I'm grateful for now," Bess told BBC Radio Bristol. "Ask Daz about me, I was always a porker." Just a month ago Bess, from Sidmouth, was taking 6-65 for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship as they lost to bottom-of-the-table Oxfordshire. At Taunton, however, his victims included Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, who have played a combined total of 170 Tests for England. His family have a strong presence in the sport, with cousins Zac and Josh also representing Devon, but who was at the County Ground to watch his moment of glory? "Dad was on holiday and mum was working, so I just had my girlfriend, her parents and a couple of my mates (watching)," he said. "I think dad will be a bit disappointed - he's gone to Greece, somewhere like that, for a week away."	Whether it comes down to skill level, body shape, or pure accident, anyone who has played a sport will have some memory of how they came to be given a particular role.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said drilling could have a significant impact on the environment. Tamboran Resources wanted to drill a 750m deep hole at a quarry at Belcoo, using permitted development rights. It issued a statement saying it was "deeply concerned" by the minister's decision. By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Tamboran had intended to drill using "permitted development rights", which meant the firm would not have needed to apply for planning permission. The minister could only veto this if he assessed that work was likely to have "a significant environmental impact". And that is exactly the position he has arrived at. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement, a process that will, conservatively, take months to complete. But it does not mean the borehole will not eventually be drilled. Alternatively, Tamboran may want to try to get a judicial review of the  decision, arguing that the minister has not interpreted the planning regulations correctly. "The company is currently reviewing its position and will release a further statement in due course," Tamboran said. Tamboran will now have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement. On Monday night, protesters held an ecumenical service at the gates of the quarry to celebrate the minister's decision. Donal O'Cofaigh from Belcoo Frack Free welcomed the decision and said it could delay the project considerably. "It's a great relief, the minister has made the right decision," he told the BBC. "This is the first time that we are going to have the opportunity to be consulted on that. This is something that is of grave concern to the local community." The MP for the area, Michelle Gildernew of Sinn FÃ©in, also welcomed the announcement. "The decision to deny Tamboran to begin deep bore test drilling in Belcoo, Fermanagh, is the correct decision given the clear opposition to fracking in the area," she said. Tamboran staff moved into the quarry three weeks ago and carried out work to secure the site. Protesters objecting to both fracking and gas exploration had held a permanent vigil at the quarry. The aim of the borehole was to check if there was enough gas below ground to warrant seeking a licence to set up a fracking operation. Protesters said they feared a borehole could be the first step towards the setting up of an industry that they believe could damage the environment and the health of local residents. The borehole drilling process would not have involved fracking. Currently, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and UUP say they oppose fracking, while the DUP has said exploration should take place, and any application for extraction should be judged at the time. Last week, politicians condemned a petrol bomb attack that targeted the family home of a Tamboran worker in Letterbreen.	Anti-fracking protesters have been celebrating a decision to block permission for an exploratory borehole for shale gas in County Fermanagh.
Mr Natzler has served as acting Clerk since the retirement of Sir Robert Rogers last year. A panel led by Mr Bercow initially recommended that Australian Carole Mills take the role but MPs objected and she has since withdrawn. News of Mr Natzler's appointment was met with cheers by MPs in the Commons. The recruitment of a new Clerk, Parliament's most senior legal and constitutional adviser, has been dogged by argument over the past nine months. MPs said Ms Mills, the original choice of the House of Commons commission who works in the Australian Parliament, did not have the relevant constitutional experience and accused Mr Bercow of a "stitch-up". Mr Bercow insisted that the appointment must have the confidence of MPs and "paused" the recruitment process before re-starting it. As part of a modernisation of procedures, the current responsibilities of the Clerk will now be split, with a new post of Commons director-general taking over responsibility for the day-to-day commercial and administrative functions of the Commons. Announcing Mr Natzler's appointment in the Commons, Mr Bercow said he had been chosen from a field of four candidates. Welcoming the appointment, David Cameron joked that Mr Bercow had "gone to the ends of the earth" to find the most qualified candidate and he was "very glad he found the right answer right here in Britain". Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Natzler's appointment was "well deserved". Before Sir Robert's retirement, Mr Natzler served as Clerk Assistant for many years.	David Natzler has been named as the next Clerk of the Commons, ending a controversial process which pitted Speaker John Bercow against some MPs.
Madihah Taheer, Ummariyat Mirza and Zainub Mirza appeared at the Old Bailey in London on 28 April. Mrs Taheer, 21, has been charged with assisting another to commit acts of terrorism by providing her bank details to purchase a knife. Mr Mirza, the husband of Mrs Taheer, 21, is charged with preparing for a terrorist attack in the UK by buying a knife and other items. Zainub Mirza from Eastfield Road, Bordesley Green, is charged with sending Islamic State propaganda videos to others. Brother and sister Ummariyat Mirza, 21, and Zainub Mirza, 23, were remanded in custody until their next court appearance. More stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mrs Taheer, of St Agathas Road, Birmingham, was granted bail with strict conditions imposed. The trio will next appear before Woolwich Crown Court on 4 September. West Midlands Police said the charges were not linked to March's Westminster attack.	Three people have appeared in court charged with terrorism offences.
Firefighters were called to the scene in Craigton Place, Winchburgh, at about 01:30 after a wheelie bin was set on fire. The bin had been resting against the house, which caused the fire to take hold quickly. Firefighters swiftly extinguished the blaze, when it was discovered that a gas pipe had been damaged in the fire. Thirty homes in the area were evacuated, with 38 residents temporarily housed at a local community centre. They were eventually allowed to return home at about 06:30. 'Young children' Police are treating the blaze as wilful fire-raising and appealed for information about the West Lothian incident. They are keen to trace anyone who may have seen someone in the area just before the bin was set alight. Det Con Adrian Wallis said: "This was a serious incident which could have had devastating consequences. "It also resulted in the evacuation of over 30 people, including young children and elderly residents. This caused much alarm and upset to those who had to leave their homes in the middle of the night. "Anyone who saw anything suspicious at around 01:00, or has any other information regarding this incident, is asked to contact us immediately."	Thirty homes had to be evacuated after a gas pipe was damaged in a fire that was started deliberately.
Historic car specialists Fiskens said they placed the car for a "short time" outside their Kensington headquarters when two traffic wardens approached. The firm said the wardens were "adamant" the 45-year-old vehicle should be given a £120 fine. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it was "issued as it would in any case". Acquisition specialist Rory Henderson said the company were always "super-careful" not to obstruct others who use the Mews when moving their vehicles around. A council spokesman said the photographer agreed to move the Ferrari but "no attempt was made" within the "statutory five-minute observation period". The car, a 1970 Ferrari 512M, is still in working condition and was recently raced at the Le Mans Classic. According to Fiskens, it has a "remarkable history" having been raced in the 1970 and 1971 Le Mans races. In 1977, it set a new record after Robert Horne drove the car 192mph over a flying mile. Fiskens call it "a superb example of one of Maranello's finest sports competition cars".	A rare Ferrari racing car worth about £10m was given a parking ticket after the owners rolled it into a Mews to take some photos.
Paul Green and Ryan McLaughlin scored their first goals for the Latics, who completed back-to-back home victories under recently returned boss John Sheridan to move to within three points of safety. Oldham gave free admission to all fans in a bid to arrest their decline in attendances. And the majority of a 7,224 crowd were almost celebrating the breakthrough in the 19th minute, only for McLaughlin's shot to be deflected inches wide. Oldham threatened again when Green pulled back a right-wing cross and Peter Clarke fired over from 10 yards. The hosts also made a bright start to the second half, with Green testing Posh goalkeeper Luke McGee and Clarke seeing his header cleared off the line by Michael Smith. Oldham struck after 69 minutes when Dominic Ball hauled down McLaughlin and Green slotted in the penalty, sending McGee the wrong way. The lead was doubled eight minutes from time as McLaughlin tapped in a six-yard volley after fine build-up play by Anthony Gerrard and Aaron Amadi-Holloway. Peterborough were well below par and did not go close to scoring until injury time when Marcus Maddison clipped the bar from distance. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was "not an option". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of Â£64.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. "The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric," he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. "A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies," added Mr Scriven. In response, Jack Reece, chairman of the Save Our Cottage Hospital Campaign, said Flint hospital was well used. Speaking at Tuesday protest, he added: "They've closed us, they took beds away from us. We've had 18 going down to 14, going down to 12, 10. "They're taking away our clinics from there. They have systematically dropped the services from this town." Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. "The status quo is not an option," the board said. "The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. "The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing." BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.	More than 1,000 campaigners trying to save a north Wales community hospital from closure have marched to a health board consultation meeting.
They say that 17 million people will benefit - by saving Â£100 a year on their bills. But many in the industry think it is a bad idea, as it will reduce competition in what is supposed to be a free market. And while the majority of householders may benefit, at least in the short term, millions of people who are currently on cheaper deals could end up paying more. So, if the Tories win the election, how would their plan work? Even though there was pressure on suppliers not to raise bills, five of the big six have gone ahead with some large price increases this year. Among the more eye-catching increases, EDF will raise electricity prices by more than 18%, and Npower put up electricity prices by 15% in March. While the suppliers blamed an increase in wholesale and environmental costs, the regulator, Ofgem, said such sharp hikes were not justified. The cap would be an upper limit on what suppliers could charge. It would follow the model introduced for the 16% of households that use pre-payment meters. Since April, these customers have had their bills capped, according to where they live in the country. Ofgem would base the precise level of the cap on the cheapest standard variable tariffs in each part of the UK, taking into account the variable costs for transporting energy there. In other words, the cap would vary in different parts of the country and be re-set every six months. About 17 million households would be affected. They consist of customers who are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically much more expensive than fixed-rate deals. Ofgem and consumer groups have repeatedly tried to persuade more people to switch to the cheaper deals, but with limited success. As a result, 66% of consumers remain on standard variable tariffs. The remaining 8.5 million customers who have switched to cheaper deals would not be affected by the cap immediately. However, if the industry has its profitability constrained by a cap on variable tariffs, it is likely that the very cheapest deals would disappear. Yes. There will still be cheaper deals on offer, but the concern is that the savings - compared with the most expensive tariffs - will be smaller than they are now. As the chart above clearly shows, there is some evidence that this is already happening. Since the middle of last year, the gap between the cheapest tariffs and the most expensive have been narrowing. SSE, for example, has raised its cheapest dual fuel deal by 37% since October last year, according to the comparison site Uswitch. However, consumer groups believe fewer people would switch supplier if there was cap - as there might be less incentive to do so. Prices are likely to rise for some, especially those on fixed-rate deals. For the majority, prices will be capped. But should wholesale costs rise, it's worth remembering that Ofgem will raise the level of the cap, so it is possible that all prices will rise anyway. Equally well, the level of the cap could fall, cutting bills for those on svts. The truth is that suppliers will try to adjust prices to maintain their profit margins. According to Lazarus Research, the profit margins of five of the big six suppliers rose to 5.6% last year - the largest since 2009. In February, shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised that Labour would also introduce a cap on energy charges. However at this stage, we do not know how this would work. In the 2015 election, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, promised to freeze prices for a 20-month period.	The Conservatives have released more details about their proposed cap on energy prices.
Nottinghamshire Police said it would expand its categories to include misogynistic incidents. It means abuse or harassment which might not be a crime can be reported to and investigated by the police, and support for the victim put in place. Nottingham Women's Centre said it hopes it will help give more victims the courage to report incidents. Chief Constable Sue Fish claimed it will make the county a safer place for women. "What women face, often on a daily basis, is absolutely unacceptable and can be extremely distressing," she said. "Nottinghamshire Police is committed to taking misogynistic hate crime seriously and encourages anyone who is affected by it to contact us without hesitation." Work on the idea first started with the Nottinghamshire Safer for Women Conference last year, co-hosted by the police with the Nottingham Women's Centre. BBC TV reporter Sarah Teale was harassed in the street while reporting on the conference. The force defines misogyny hate crime as: "Incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman and includes behaviour targeted towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman." The classification now means people can report incidents which might not be considered to be a crime and the police will investigate. Nottingham Women's Centre has been helping train call centre, force control staff and officers on the beat to recognise misogynistic hate crime and ways to tackle it. These officers will also examine if and how a victim can be supported or if anything can be done to help prevent them being targeted again. Domestic abuse will not be recorded as a misogyny hate crime because it has its own procedure, the force said. Melanie Jeffs, centre manager at Nottingham Women's Centre, said: "We're pleased to see Nottinghamshire Police recognise the breadth of violence and intimidation that women experience on a daily basis in our communities." She added: "Recording this as a hate crime will give us a detailed picture of how often, when and where it is happening. It has been very difficult to build that picture before but we will now get detailed data to analyse. "Showing that the police take it seriously will also give people the confidence to come forward and report offences." A crime that the victim or any other person perceives to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards any aspect of a person's identity. Police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually monitor five strands of hate crime: Forces can include their own definition of a hate crime with several recently adding sub cultures.	Harassment of women is to be recorded as a hate crime in a bid to tackle sexist abuse.
The highly symbolic visit, Mr Xi's first since becoming leader in 2012, comes amid an increasingly tense political climate. Official celebrations are planned, as well as large protests from pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. Several well-known activists were arrested on the eve of Mr Xi's arrival. The group, which included student leader Joshua Wong, had staged a protest at an iconic sculpture symbolising the handover. The golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower - Hong Kong's emblem - by the city's harbour was a gift from China. Mr Xi arrived for the three-day visit with his wife Peng Liyuan at the city's main Chek Lap Kok airport. The couple were welcomed by a marching band and children waving flags. In a brief speech on the tarmac, he said Hong Kong was "always in my heart". Beijing's central government "has always been a strong backer of Hong Kong" and "will, as always, support Hong Kong's economic development and improvement of people's lives". He also said Beijing was "willing to work with all sectors of Hong Kong's society in maintaining Hong Kong's extraordinary journey these past 20 years", and would "ensure 'one country, two systems' will continue with stability". The city was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing agreed to govern it under "one country, two systems", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties, and rights like freedom of assembly and free speech. But China's growing influence has been met with unease and concerns that the mainland could undermine Hong Kong's more politically liberal traditions. Activists have been campaigning for years for Hong Kong to have more political freedom. A series of official celebrations are planned for this weekend, as well as the inauguration of Hong Kong's incoming chief executive Carrie Lam. But parts of Hong Kong are under a tight security lockdown amid worries of further protests, with several major roads closed and sections of the city centre blocked off from the public. Thousands of police officers are being deployed across the city and along the route Mr Xi's motorcade will take when it enters the city. When former president Hu Jintao visited for the 15-year celebrations in 2012, he was met with hundreds of thousands of protesters, marching against what they saw as Beijing's stifling influence on political reform in the city. Tensions spilled over into mass protests in the city centre in September 2014, with calls for full democracy and the resignation of then-Chief Executive CY Leung.	Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Hong Kong to mark 20 years since the territory was handed back to China by Britain.
Europe's largest 10km run had more than 35,000 runners last year and there will also be a half-marathon this time. "Manchester is a truly resilient city and we look forward to successfully hosting these great sporting events," said city councillor Luthfur Rahman. Earlier, Chelsea cancelled their Premier League victory parade, which was due to take place on Sunday. The club say it would be "inappropriate" with the UK terror threat at its highest level after Monday's bombing killed 22 people and injured 64. Greater Manchester Police and the city council had already said athletics' Great CityGames could take place in Manchester on Friday evening. Now they have given the go-ahead for the Great Run, with additional security measures expected to be in force. Rahman, the council's executive member for culture and leisure, said: "The Great CityGames and Great Manchester Run are two of the real highlights of Manchester's sporting calendar. "We know that thousands of Mancunians have been looking forward to taking part, or cheering the athletes on, so I am pleased and proud to confirm that these fantastic events will be held as planned this weekend." Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford is among those lined up to take part on Friday, with Sunday's field including Ethiopia's triple Olympic champions Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba. Chelsea had planned an open-top bus tour with the trophy and hoped to add the FA Cup in Saturday's final with Arsenal. The Gunners have also said they will not stage a parade should they win. A screening of the match at the club's Emirates Stadium has been cancelled and fans will be given refunds. Chelsea said players will make a donation to a fund supporting victims of the attack and they will wear black armbands for the final at Wembley, with a minute's silence beforehand. "Everyone associated with Chelsea Football Club offers our heartfelt condolences to those affected by Monday's terror attack in Manchester," said a club statement. "Our thoughts go out to all the victims and their families and friends." Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the safety of supporters and staff was paramount and the club had been in close contact with the security services. "After taking their advice we have reluctantly taken the decision to cancel the screening and potential parade," he said. Spectators at all major events can expect to see more armed police and face longer security checks. Media playback is not supported on this device A rough sleeper who helped victims of the bomb attack is to be given six months' free accommodation by David Sullivan, West Ham United's co-chairman. Sullivan and his eldest son Dave were moved by reports of a man named Steve who tended to children when the bomb went off at a concert being given by American singer Ariana Grande. West Ham's joint owner tracked down the homeless man after putting out an appeal on BBC Radio 5 live while his son took to social media. They are now working out a plan to pay his rent for the next six months, while also providing him with new clothes and opportunities to find work . "Steve was just one of hundreds of people who forgot about their own safety and rushed to the aid of others, and we were both moved by his story," David Sullivan told 5 live. Media playback is not supported on this device A minute's silence was observed before the Europa League final between Manchester United and Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday and both wore black armbands. The opening ceremony was considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. England and South Africa stood shoulder to shoulder for a minute's silence before the first match of the one-day cricket series at Headingley. Both teams wore black armbands as they took the field in Leeds, with all 15 members of the England squad lining up on the pitch alongside the tourists and umpires for a sombrely observed silence. Formula 1 is expected to observe a silence before this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix. F1's teams, the majority of which are based in Britain, have also agreed to have #Manchester on their cars. British driver Lewis Hamilton said he would be thinking of the victims. "I am carrying them in my heart this weekend," said Hamilton. "It is difficult to think about it and it is just crazy to think where we are in the world." Salford are to waive admission prices for their next rugby league match in return for donations to the appeal fund. Fans can obtain free tickets for the Red Devils' Super League match against Catalans Dragons at the AJ Bell Stadium on Friday night but will be asked to make a donation in return. "Like everybody, I was shocked and outraged by the events of Monday night," said Salford owner Dr Marwan Koukash, a Palestinian refugee who became a self-made millionaire after coming to England to study. Supporters attending this weekend's football play-off finals at Wembley are being urged to arrive at least an hour before kick-off. Blackpool take on Exeter City in League Two on Sunday while Huddersfield Town face Reading in Monday's Championship match. Both games start at 15:00 BST. Fans are asked not to bring bags, with extra security in place. A minute's silence will be held before both games, with players and match officials wearing black armbands. Police Scotland will be reviewing its security, including arrangements for Saturday's Scottish Cup final. Premiership Rugby said there will be a minute's silence before Saturday's final between Exeter and Wasps at Twickenham. And in the Women's Super League Manchester City Women's home game against Chelsea Ladies on Thursday night will go ahead after discussions with police. The game, which will kick off at 19:00, is the first professional sports fixture to take place in the city after the attack. Security around the Indianapolis 500 in the US will be beefed up this weekend. "One thing fans may notice this year, there will be an increased presence of armed law enforcement folks wandering through the grounds," Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Doug Boles said.	The Great Manchester Run will go ahead on Sunday following talks over security after the Manchester Arena attack.
The report by the UN Agency for Human Settlements says that the richest 20% of the population on average earn 20 times more than the poorest 20%. According to the study, Guatemala is the country with the widest disparity, and Venezuela the most equitable one. The survey says the region is the world's most urbanised, with eight out of 10 people living in cities. The report, State of the Cities of Latin America, suggests that by 2050, nearly nine out of 10 Latin Americans will live in cities and its authors suggest Latin American nations use the current period of relative economic stability and slower population growth to make life in the cities more equitable. "The main challenge is how to combat such huge disparities in the cities," Erik Vittrup of the UN Agency for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) said. According to the study, income inequality in Latin America remains extremely high. "There is a considerable job deficit and a large labour informality affecting mainly the young and women," it says. The report says that Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Argentina and Guatemala have all seen an increase in inequality between 1990 and 2009. But Mr Vittrup said there were some indications of a positive trend. "We're at the end of an era of urban explosion, with few exceptions. "We're seeing a reduction in poverty, indigence in urban areas; unemployment is going down," Mr Vittrup said. He said that, overall, the region was ready for a transition to quality of life, equity and sustainability.	A study by the United Nations suggests the gap between the rich and the poor in much of Latin America is widening.
The man died at the scene on Cottingley Cliffe Road, Bingley, West Yorkshire, shortly after 19:34 BST on Tuesday. Police said they tried stopping the car after it was seen "acting suspiciously" but it drove off at speed hitting the cyclist a short distance away. The driver is in custody and the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.	A cyclist has been killed after he was hit by a car as the driver tried to speed away from police.
Lee Tomlin's penalty lit up a quiet first period after Tammy Abraham was brought down in the box by Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski. David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding. Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards. The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th. Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests. Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross. After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate. Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: "It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it. "It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid. "We haven't got what we deserved from recent games. Now we are three points off the play-offs and looking up the table again." Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy: "The difference between the teams was a penalty and a worldie. They started well, but we got to grips with that. "We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal. It was absolutely unstoppable. "I have no complaints about our display. We need to be more effective in the final third, but other than that I felt we competed well against a good side." Match ends, Bristol City 2, Ipswich Town 0.

Moeen, 27, took 19 wickets in five Tests against India in 2014 but was less impressive in last week's win over West Indies, despite figures of 4-98. "India didn't show me enough respect in the way they batted against me," he said. "It's going to be tougher playing New Zealand and Australia." England start five Tests against the Kiwis in May and Australia in July. In less than a year since making his Test debut against Sri Lanka, Worcestershire's Moeen has become key to England's attack and was flown out to Grenada for the victory over West Indies in the second Test after recovering from a side strain. The off-spinner says that decision by the selectors gave him confidence and, despite a slow start with first innings figures of 1-47 then took three tail-end wickets as England bowled the hosts out for 307 in their second innings. "Even when I wasn't bowling so well in the first innings it gave me confidence the management backed me, liked the way I bowl and think I'm a threat to the batsmen," added Moeen, who averages 27.53 with the ball in his eight Tests. After a century in his second Test outing, Moeen has not contributed more than 40 in any knock since and is seen as an option to bat at six, with Jos Butler and Ben Stokes also possibilities. "Whatever the captain and coach want me to bat I'm more than happy," he said. "We see it as a strong batting line up. Hopefully when we all play games and click we can be dangerous." England begin their final Test of their tour of West Indies on 1 May, leading 1-0 in the series.	England spinner Moeen Ali expects his second summer of Test cricket to prove more difficult than his first.
Some dairy farmers have said they face going out of business if prices they receive for their products do not rise. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production. Asda has said it will begin paying 28p a litre for milk from Monday. Dairy farmers currently receive about 19p a litre for milk, well below the cost of production at about 27p. Asda confirmed on Friday that it had told Dale Farm, its Northern Ireland supplier, that it will increase the price it pays to 28p a litre. It said this would "assist our farmers during the current crisis". Ian Marshall, the president of the UFU, said Asda's move was something farmers were "glad to see" and hoped other retailers would follow. But he warned that the situation remained "dire" for those in the dairy industry. "It's a starting point for us," Mr Marshall said. "What we're seeing is a move in the right direction. "We just hope it's something that it can roll out to other products, not just milk." Mr Marshall said farmers accept that they need to "strive to produce as efficiently as possible". Asda has said that the cost of paying more for milk will not be passed on to its customers and retail prices will remain at their current rate.	A decision by supermarket chain Asda to increase the price it pays for milk is a move in the right direction, the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has said.
The 22-year-old Scotland international made five appearances for Leeds in 2012 and was released by the Rhinos at the end of the 2013 Super League season. Hood will join his former Leeds team-mate Ben Jones-Bishop at the Red Devils next season. "I'm very pleased that I've got this chance again and I'm going to take it with both hands," said Hood. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's a massive challenge. I've had a couple of years out of top-flight rugby and it's a big change. "You don't realise how much it benefits you being full-time. I'm really looking forward to getting back into it."	Salford Red Devils have signed hooker Liam Hood from Championship One Hunslet Hawks on a two-year deal from 2015.
A passer-by found the man, who has not been named but was in his 30s, off Promenade Street in Heywood at about 23:25 GMT on Thursday. He was pronounced dead at the scene and officers are treating the death as suspicious. A post-mortem examination is due to take place and officers have asked for any witnesses to contact them.	Police have launched an investigation after the body of man was found in an alleyway in Rochdale.
The association and groups including the Mountaineering Council of Scotland have raised concerns in the past about rubbish being left in the shelters. Use of bothies increases in summer months. The MBA has now issued a new message asking people to help keep bothies in a tidy state. The association said: "With summer upon us we are seeing many visitors to bothies, especially on the more popular long-distance trails, who perhaps have not used one before and who seem unaware that unlike in some other countries, our mountain bothies are not serviced and have no rubbish collection service. "Bothies rely on you to remove your litter, and that of any inconsiderate others, so please help where you can." Last year, one of two volunteers who looks after Corrour Bothy in the Lairig Ghru, Cairngorms, told of taking four hours to sort through and burn waste left there. Neil Reid said hillwalkers had to be willing to pick up litter they find.	The Mountain Bothies Association has appealed to hillwalkers and climbers to help keep more than 100 shelters it looks after in the UK clean and tidy.
People will be able to subscribe to popular channels such as Discovery and Eurosport individually, without paying for a bundle of channels. Until now, Prime Video has offered only on-demand films and TV shows in the UK. But one analyst said the launch line-up of channels was "not immediately desirable" and would struggle to attract satellite TV customers. "Amazon launched a similar thing in the US, and the big selling point was that you could get HBO and Showtime programmes, all under one umbrella," said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders. "That's not going to happen here. Sky have HBO and Showtime locked down, at least for now, and will hold on to them aggressively. "When you look at what's available in the UK, it does lack the wow factor." Discovery Communications is providing the best-known pay-TV channels to the service, offering Eurosport for £6.99 a month and Discovery Channel for £4.99 a month. Viewers must also pay for an Amazon Prime membership at £79 a year. ITV will offer an ad-free version of its streaming service and access to its free channels - such ITV 2 and ITV Be - for a monthly fee of £3.99. "This is a starting point," said Alex Green, managing director of Amazon Video. "We're offering linear TV channels where it makes sense. We have a good spread of big partners and I'm sure that will only grow." As well as the traditional television channels, viewers will be able to pay for curated "channels" of programmes to stream on-demand, such as the Yoga Anytime Channel, and Horse & Country Play, which is billed as the "home of equestrianism". "The core of the experience on Prime Video is on-demand streaming, and that will still be the core of the experience," said Mr Green. Mr Harrington said it would be difficult for streaming services to offer traditional television services at a competitive price. "In the US, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have been vocal about getting TV bundles together, but YouTube is the only one to have done it so far," he told the BBC. "It's very hard to build from all these different suppliers and put these channels together at a price that is compatible to a cable offering." Mr Green said Amazon wanted to offer customers more flexibility, by letting them subscribe to individual channels. "Often people say they are subscribed to a big TV package but don't watch a lot of the channels," he told the BBC. "Now people can try it out, pick and choose, and cancel at any time."	Amazon has announced it will offer live television channels via its Prime Video service, for an extra fee.
It follows UKIP leader Nigel Farage's comments on migrants using the NHS for HIV treatment costing Â£25,000 per year. On the Daily Politics Wales Election Debate on Thursday, Lib Dem Jane Dodds said UKIP lacked "care and compassion" on such healthcare issues. UKIP's Caroline Jones said Ms Dodds was "taking things to extremes" but claimed people were "fed up to the back teeth". Ms Jones told the programme that she understood Mr Farage's comments that the NHS was treating too many people from abroad with HIV. She said: "Is it fair when you've got a small pot of money to allow someone to come in who has never contributed to that pot, and have someone from your family or your constituency to be denied medication and treatment? "That is constantly happening." But Ms Dodds said everybody should have fair treatment, asking "Do you want border security guards on hospitals? "Do you want GPs' surgeries to have lines that say 'do not cross here unless you've paid into the system for five years'? "Where is the care and compassion here?" Plaid Cymru's Carrie Harper said debate about immigration should not be taboo as it was an issue that voters wanted to discuss. "But this type of scaremongering and the blaming immigrants for everything rhetoric is very unhelpful to the debate," she added. "The economic problems facing people in our communities have been caused by the reckless behaviour of bankers in the City, and they've been caused by the austerity agenda of the London parties." For Labour, Nick Thomas-Symonds said the NHS would not be able to function without migrant workers. "The National Health Service is the greatest achievement of any post-War government," he said. "There is no doubt at all factually that without migrant workers working in it, you wouldn't have an NHS in 2015." For the Conservatives, Emma Lane said immigration had been beneficial to the UK. "Immigration can and has benefited our country but it must be managed," she said. "We need to control immigration so the pressure doesn't continue on public services".	A Welsh Liberal Democrat election candidate has accused UKIP of wanting "border security guards" at hospitals.
In return Venezuela accused Chile of "inadmissible interventionism" and a "lack of diplomatic circumspection". Braulio Jatar was taken into custody on 3 September after publishing videos of a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Mr Jatar was born in Chile and also has Venezuelan nationality. He is an open supporter of the opposition and runs a news website on Margarita island in Venezuela. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based pressure group, called on Venezuela to "allow all journalists to report freely". On Monday. Brazil's foreign minister also criticised the Venezuelan government's actions, saying the country had seen an increase in what he called "arbitrary detentions". Jose Serra told a local newspaper such detentions "make it even more difficult to have the dialogue between government and opposition that is indispensable for overcoming the dramatic political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis that is affecting Venezuela". At the start of September, Mr Jatar released videos of a protest when island residents jeered the president. Protests have been a regular occurrence in Venezuela as the opposition calls for President Maduro to be removed from power. They blame him for the country's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his rule. President Maduro accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup. Mr Jatar was arrested with about 30 other people on Margarita island. The others have since been released but Mr Jatar is still in detention and his family believe he is not on the island any more. Some reports said the authorities claimed he had tens of thousands of dollars in cash, which was to be used to attack an international summit starting on Margarita island on Tuesday. Venezuelan prosecutors have not commented on the detention but the foreign ministry said he was suspected of extortion and fraud. Chile demanded at the weekend that Venezuela make the journalist's whereabouts known. The Venezuelan government said it "rejected" the demand and accused the Chilean foreign minister of "bowing to pressure from the most reactionary sections of the bourgeoisie" who still support General Pinochet, the country's former right-wing dictator. Chile's response was to say that "the promotion and defence of human rights do not have borders" and Mr Jatar had not had access to his lawyer in a week.	The government of Chile has demanded that Venezuela "immediately" disclose the location of a journalist who was detained earlier this month.
The incident happened within the grounds of the city's bus station in Smithfield Street just before 10:30 GMT on Monday. The woman was in her 30s but her name has not yet been released. The depot is now closed. Translink confirmed that an incident had taken place and that an investigation was under way. An eyewitness at the bus station, Jo-anna McLucas, described what she saw in the immediate aftermath of the collision. "I was on the phone and I heard a bang, I looked up to see what had happened," Ms McLucas said. "The bus had hit the wall and I walked outside and there was a small gap between the wall and the bus and I could see there was someone on the ground." Ciaran Rogan from Translink told the BBC: "Our thoughts and our sympathies are with the family and relations and friends of the young lady involved. "It really is a tragedy." Mr Rogan said the bus driver was "distressed" and would be given support by the transport company. "We would have assistance available within Translink [for those] who are involved in accidents because it can affect people very badly at times. "We'll give the driver every assistance as we will any member of staff who was badly affected." Mr Rogan said other Translink workers at the station would be affected by the fatality but added that "our main job at the moment is to find out what happened".	A woman has died after being knocked down by a bus in Lisburn, County Antrim.
The energy firm reported a 24% drop in pre-tax profits for 2016 to £172m - much of that explained by the weak oil drilling and refining markets in the United States. It reduced the valuation of its US assets by £30m, though it said there were signs of that market recovering. Revenue fell in 2016 by 3% to £1.5bn. Aggreko said trading conditions were particularly difficult in South America, with a renegotiation of a contract to supply power in Argentina. European trading was stronger. The figures lacked the boost Aggreko gets regularly from supplying power to the Olympics and Winter Olympics. Comparisons with 2015 looked poorer because that year included temporary powering for the European Games. The company pulled out of bidding for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games, complaining that the bidding process was running too late and was disorganised. Aggreko, which is headquartered in Glasgow with a generator assembly plant in Dumbarton, intends to cut annual costs by £25m, starting in the second half of this year. Commenting on current trading and outlook, chief executive Chris Weston said he expected the cost cutting to help the firm achieve growth in 2017: "However, this will be more than offset by the significant impact of Argentina, and as a result we expect full year profit before tax and pre-exceptional items to be lower than last year." As a response to the results announcement, Aggreko's share price dropped by 11%. Mr Weston added: "Whilst the trading environment over the last 12 months has been challenging I am pleased with the progress that we are making across the group, implementing our transformation programme to return the business to growth. "We are investing in the right technologies to reduce costs to our customers, improving our customer focus and delivering efficiencies."	Scotland-based temporary power company Aggreko has suffered a slump in its share valuation after warning of a dip in profit this year.
Storms smashed a hole in the sea wall alongside the line above the seafront in Dawlish, south Devon in 2014. The railway line took two months to repair at an estimated cost of £1bn to the local economy. Network Rail is consulting with Devon and Cornwall residents about the plans. They include strengthening defences and cliffs, as well and building breakwaters to protect the line. More on the coastal rail protection work, and other Devon and Cornwall news Cliffs next to the line would be stabilised and reshaped so they are not as steep under the plans. A total of £270m is allocated for spending on priority areas including around Dawlish between 2019 and 2024. The line connects Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the UK.	Protecting a key coastal railway track from rising sea levels and falling cliffs is going to cost about £650m, Network Rail has said.
The vote held on Friday was for 68 seats out of the 290 in parliament. It meant that nervous Iranians woke up on Saturday morning to an all new political landscape. For the first time in 13 years moderates and reformists now have a majority in parliament. While it was not a sweeping victory for the supporters of President Hassan Rouhani, it was still a surprise win, especially given the months of heavy campaigning against the government's policies. Hardliners had a majority in the outgoing parliament. In the three years since Hassan Rouhani took office, they have bitterly opposed most of government's plans, organising a fierce attack on the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Some MPs have even gone so far as to describe Foreign Minister Javad Zarif as a traitor. The popular moderate who negotiated the nuclear deal has regularly been subject to harsh criticism in parliament and is under constant threat of impeachment by fundamentalist MPs. Now almost all those MPs have been unseated by moderate or reformist counterparts, and those who remain either supported the deal or at least never attacked it as vociferously as their unseated comrades. Many observers argue the nuclear deal not only brought an end to years of harsh international sanctions but was also the deal-breaker in the elections. The people were saying no to those who had promised to stop the deal. What puts this victory in a more meaningful context is the fact that it was achieved despite almost all well-known reformists being banned from running in the elections and a complete lack of media coverage of their campaign in the run-up to the elections. State TV and media never gave equal coverage to reformists or moderate candidates and even led a campaign against the deal in recent months. The only medium available to pro-government candidates was the internet and social media, which they used to the maximum in getting their message across, especially to the young and women. The triumph of the reformists should lead to a major realignment within parliament, making it more supportive of President Rouhani. But it will by no means end the president's problems when it comes to delivering his election promises. The nuclear deal has hit some rough patches on its way to implementation. Apart from domestic oppositions from hardliners in parliament and other unelected bodies, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome outside of Iran. The international banks still have not opened up to Iranian businesses and in the US, conservatives in Congress are doing all they can to derail the deal. Any more delays in its implementation and ensuing lifting of sanctions would harm President Rouhani's economic reform plans and would prepare the ground for hardliners to recover from the this week's defeat in order to reshape their campaign against the government. Time is not on the moderates' side and the new momentum could die down easily if it is not supported by economic rewards. This is a worry that every unseated hardliner MP is focusing on from now onwards.	The run-off parliamentary election win by the moderate government of Iran is a crucial victory for them.
Concerns were raised after the youngster drew a picture of a man cutting the vegetable. Staff in Luton told the child's mother they believed he was saying "cooker bomb" instead of "cucumber". The case was sent to a police and social services panel instead of de-radicalisation scheme Channel. It decided not to take further action. The boy's mother, who has not been named to protect her son's identity, concluded the confusion was due to the way her son pronounced the word. "She (the member of nursery staff) kept saying it was this one picture of the man cutting the cucumber....which she said to me is a 'cooker bomb', and I was baffled," she told the BBC Asian Network. Read this and more stories from Beds, Bucks and Herts She said she feared her children would be taken away from her and added: 'But I haven't done anything wrong... It was a horrible day." Teachers and public service workers have a legal obligation to report any concerns of extremist behaviour to the authorities since July. Just under 2,000 under-15s were referred between January 2012 and December 2015. Teaching unions say there is confusion over the government's counter-terrorism strategy in schools. Alex Kenny from the National Union of Teachers said: "Teachers are scared of getting it wrong. "They think Ofsted is going to criticise them if they haven't reported these things, and you end up [with] the boy making the spelling mistake, or the boy saying something in Arabic - that then gets reported on." The Department for Education said its counter-terrorism strategy Prevent is "entirely consistent" with schools' responsibilities and "good schools would already be safeguarding children from extremism".	A nursery suggested referring a four-year-old boy to a de-radicalisation programme after he mispronounced the word "cucumber", it is alleged.
The 2005 world champion, who has lost just one frame in three matches, took just 53 matches to record his win. Ding won the last three frames, the decider with a break of 108, to beat Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 4-3. Reigning world champion Stuart Bingham defeated Wales' Ryan Day 4-2 to set up a last-four meeting with Joe Perry who saw off Ali Carter 4-1.	Shaun Murphy crushed Liang Wenbo 4-0 to set up a World Grand Prix semi-final against Ding Junhui in Llandudno.
The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman was not in the House of Commons to hear Prime Minister David Cameron make his argument for air strikes. The Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Lib Dems were all critical. The SNP defended MP and MSP Mr Salmond saying he was on constituency business. A spokesman stated that Mr Salmond attended a "full briefing" on Wednesday from the security services and the joint chiefs about the Syria situation and there was "nothing in the PM's statement which was of surprise or new". He added that SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, had responded as planned to Mr Cameron's address. And when the issue is fully debated in the Commons, Mr Salmond would make his contribution as his party's foreign affairs spokesman. After attending First Minister's Questions at Holyrood, the former SNP leader visited the Scottish National Portrait Gallery where he unveiled the painting, by artist Gerard M Burns. Later Mr Salmond is due to host a Scottish Parliamentary reception for veterans, serving armed forces personnel, and local community representatives. He will also brief MSPs on the SNP position on Syria. However, the long-arranged portrait unveiling was criticised by Ms Davidson who said: "There is nothing more serious than the potential deployment of our service personnel abroad. "Alex Salmond has form in unveiling vanity projects to himself but he needs to remember he's paid - twice over - to be a parliamentarian, not an art critic." Mr Rennie added: "Nothing gets in the way of Alex Salmond's ego including debating war and peace in our country and the Middle East. "His absence from the Commons at this critical moment means we will be more sceptical about his motivations the next time he expresses outrage on the matter." A spokesman for Scottish Labour said: "If Alex Salmond was chocolate he would eat himself. On the day that he had a job to do in parliament over Syria it's ridiculous that the SNP's foreign affairs spokesperson was in Edinburgh to look at a picture of himself."	Former first minister Alex Salmond has been criticised for unveiling his new portrait in Edinburgh on the day MPs discussed military action in Syria.
A pre-inquest review was due to take place on Monday, but has now been postponed until March. West Sussex County Council said the full inquest was now likely to be held late 2017, but was "very dependent" on the police investigation. A lawyer representing some of the victims' families described "a measure of frustration" at the news. A vintage hawker hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during an aerobatic stunt at the Shoreham show in August 2015, killing 11 men. The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived the crash and is being investigated for manslaughter. Plans were put in place for the inquest to begin in March, but neither the police investigation nor the full Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report have yet been published. Specialist aviation lawyer James Healey Pratt said the victims' families had full confidence in the coroner and the investigation. He said the pre-inquest hearing was being delayed until March as a decision by the CPS on whether to bring charges was due then. He also revealed the families had been invited to a meeting in Farnborough on 19 December, at which they would be told the results of the AAIB investigation. Sussex Police's report is not expected until the new year at the earliest. West Sussex Senior Coroner Penelope Schofield said the decision to postpone the pre-inquest review was "not taken lightly", particularly as she was anxious to ensure the inquests were dealt with in a timely manner. But it was anticipated little progress could be made with the police and AAIB report still outstanding, she added.	An inquest into the deaths of 11 men at the Shoreham Airshow is not likely for another year, the BBC can reveal.
Sweeney, 20, made 16 appearances for Rovers during a loan spell last season, while Telford, also 20, moved to Stoke from Blackpool in July 2015. "I am now looking forward to playing in League One with Rovers and can't wait to get started," Telford said. "I am really pleased to be coming back to Bristol Rovers," added Sweeney. "I know that there were other clubs interested in taking me on loan, but once I knew that Rovers were interested there was only one club I wanted to join." Sweeney was named as Young Player of the Year at Bristol Rovers last season. Manager Darrell Clarke said: "I am looking forward to working with both of them as the season progresses and would like to thank Mark Cartwright and Mark Hughes at Stoke for allowing Ryan and Dominic to join us." The Gas begin their season on Saturday with a trip to The Valley to face Charlton Athletic. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Bristol Rovers have signed defender Ryan Sweeney and striker Dominic Telford on season-long loan deals from Premier League side Stoke City.
Glamorgan were beaten in under two-and-a-half days against Worcestershire having failed to last two days in their opening loss at Northamptonshire. Rudolph says discussions have been held with the senior players and head coach Robert Croft. "We've had some good, strong conversations," Rudolph said. "I think it's important for the senior players in the team to stand up. "We have a good blend of senior players and a lot of young Welsh talent in the likes of Aneurin Donald and Kiran Carlson. "We've refocused and we're ready for Friday's game against Leicestershire and it will be nice to start off with a win. "I've always been of the belief that in County Cricket as soon as you can gather some momentum you've got to try and carry it on for a long time." Glamorgan were beaten by an innings and 22 runs by Northants in their opening game of the season before an eight-wicket loss at home to Worcestershire. Despite his side's poor start to the season, South African Rudolph still believes Glamorgan can make an impression in Division Two of the County Championship. "If you look at last season we started with three losses and during the season there were about three or four games where we just missed out on winning opportunities," Rudolph told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "If that had happened we would still have finished in the top three or four so it's not all doom and gloom at the moment."	Captain Jacques Rudolph has said Glamorgan's senior players need to "stand up" after the county's poor start to the Championship season.
The four-year-old was in Skegness, Lincolnshire, when a Jack Russell-type dog allegedly bit her a number of times at about 13:45 BST on Saturday. The owner of the animal allegedly refused to provide her details to the parents of the child. Police are treating the incident as an offence of having a dog dangerously out of control in a public place. The dog had allegedly been sitting under the owner's chair at the time and was not on a lead. The girl required hospital treatment following the incident off Grand Parade. Dogs are banned from this area from 1 May to 30 September.	A dog attack on a girl on a beach has led to police releasing a picture of the animal's owner.
The newspaper has been widely boycotted in the city because of its accusations following the Hillsborough disaster. A motion put forward at a meeting on Wednesday night condemned the paper for its "blatant lies" about the tragedy, in which Liverpool 96 fans were killed. The Society of Editors said the council was "stretching towards censorship". Put forward by Labour councillor Mary Rasmussen at Liverpool Town Hall, the motion said: "Due to crowd control mismanagement those fans, whose ages ranged from 10 to 67 years old, had the life crushed out of them. "Contrary to the facts, The S*n published a front page story with the banner headline 'The Truth' which contained blatant lies. "For this reason we call on all retailers and vendors of newspapers in Liverpool to stop selling The S*n," said the motion, which recognised the efforts of the campaign group Total Eclipse of the S*n to "rid" the city of the newspaper. The Sun said it had no comment on the vote, although the newspaper and the editor at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy have previously apologised for the coverage. Relatives of Hillsborough victims attended the full council meeting, where mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said the newspaper would "never, ever be forgiven", and if he could legally do so he "would ban it from shops across the city". However, Bob Satchwell, from the Society of Editors, which represents about 400 media outlets, said: "In a free society people must be free to choose which newspapers they read or sell. "The comments from Joe Anderson demonstrate the danger when he says that if he has his way he would ban The Sun. That is what happens in dictatorships and banana republics." Everton-based newsagent Ronald Butterfield also said it was "wrong for the council to get involved". "I don't sell it but it is up to people to decide." He added: "When I tell people who aren't from Liverpool I don't sell it they look at me like I've got knickers on my head. "One Liverpool man who always bought it for the horses not the news cancelled it because he was worried about the paperboy being seen delivering it." Explaining why a council-backed campaign was necessary in a city where The Sun is widely boycotted, Emily Heywood of the Total Eclipse of the S*n group said that with new newsagents and changing owners some retailers "had started selling it again and it wasn't being questioned". All 96 fans who died as a result of a crush at Hillsborough were unlawfully killed, their inquests concluded in April.	A campaign calling on retailers in Liverpool to stop selling The Sun has received the unanimous backing of city councillors.
AB de Villiers smashed 71 off 29 balls and Hashim Amla an unbeaten 69 off 38 as the hosts chased down 172 with 5.2 overs to spare in Johannesburg. England lost their last seven wickets for 14 runs as they were bowled out for 171 despite Jos Buttler's 28-ball 54. Eoin Morgan made 38 and Joe Root 34, while Chris Morris claimed 3-26. Defeat was England's fifth in succession in limited-overs cricket, and means they ended a tour on which they won the Test series with losses in both the one-day and T20 series. It was their final competitive game before the World Twenty20 in India starts on 8 March, while South Africa face Australia in a three-match T20 campaign on home soil from 4 March. Bayliss: 'It was men against boys' The manner in which England were dismantled by De Villiers and Amla dented the optimism built up during a successful 12 months in the limited-overs format. Captain Morgan said: "It's just a blip - we've had such a good run of things in white-ball cricket. "I honestly think we are on the right track playing a brand of cricket that can win an ICC event, whether it is this one coming up or one in 2017." If England had any hopes of defending an apparently testing total at the Wanderers, they were ended by a riotous 125-run opening stand between De Villiers and Amla spanning 8.2 overs. De Villiers will rightly take the headlines for a remarkable display of hitting, marrying power with placement against an increasingly ill-disciplined attack. He flicked the first ball of the innings from Reece Topley for four and plundered 22 off the next over from Chris Jordan on his way to a 21-ball fifty, the fastest by a South African in T20s. "I really enjoy it up the order," said De Villiers. "You can play normal shots and get value for your strokes. That's where I want to bat." By the time he sliced Adil Rashid to wide long-off, he had scored 60 of his 71 runs in boundaries, and victory was as good as sealed. Such was his dominance that Amla's elegant 27-ball half-century went largely unnoticed, while Faf du Plessis had the luxury of sealing victory with a cover-driven four off Jordan. Jordan's 2.4 overs cost 48 runs, while Topley, whose mistake allowed South Africa to win the first T20 in Cape Town on Friday, leaked 32 from two wicketless overs. As well as De Villiers and Amla batted, England's defeat was arguably founded on their remarkable batting collapse. A slide from 157-3 to 171 all out in 18 deliveries was largely of their own making, hastened by a rash of wild strokes on a reliable surface offering pace and bounce. Only Joe Root, with 34 off 17 balls, Eoin Morgan (38 off 23) and Buttler, who smashed four fours and four sixes, emerged with any credit. This is how the collapse unfolded:	South Africa swept to a comprehensive nine-wicket victory over England in the second Twenty20 to seal a 2-0 series win.
Producers of precious metals were particularly hard hit. Analysts blamed falling prices for gold and silver and adverse currency movements. Fresnillo, which owns the world's biggest silver mine, was down 4.5% and Randgold was down 4.2%. "Gold is in no man's land," said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG Index. He says that investors are concerned that gold could fall below $1,200 dollars an ounce, which would make some gold mines unviable. Gold is currently trading at $1,266 dollars an ounce. In China iron ore prices fell to the lowest level in almost five years, which hit shares in other miners. Rio Tinto fell 0.73% and BHP Billiton was down 0.37%. BP was 2.59% higher. Shares had slumped 6% on Thursday after a US judge found the firm "grossly negligent" over the 2010 oil spill. The ruling has made investors cautious over the firm. "I'm not buying BP here. The ruling opens up the door in the United States to more fines for BP," said Beaufort Securities sales trader Basil Petrides. "The US government has got its knife out for BP and it's sharpening the blade," he said. On the currency markets the euro was trading 0.13% higher, but still below the $1.30 level. It fell below the $1.30 level on Thursday in reaction to a surprise cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank. The Bank also launched a programme to buy private sector debt, in another effort to boost European economies. The pound was down 0.10% against the dollar at $1.6314.	(Close): The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares closed the day down by 0.36% at 6853.40.
Moslemuddin Sarkar, 52, arrived back in Dhaka on Tuesday, a day after being freed from a Pakistani jail with the help of the Red Cross. His family lost contact after Mr Sarkar left for India in search of work in 1989. Years later, he ended up in Pakistan, where he was arrested. He says he was beaten and tortured in his subsequent 15 years in prison. "I requested that embassy officials send me back to Bangladesh but no one listened to me," he told the BBC. "I suffered a lot in the prison and was crying for help. But no-one came to my rescue. Still I don't understand why I was kept in jail for such a long time. At last, I am back with my family and I feel great." There were emotional scenes when Mr Sarkar was welcomed by relatives at Dhaka airport, the BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan reports from Bangladesh. A younger brother, Julhas Uddin, told the AFP news agency that Mr Sarkar's mother "passed out as he hugged her" after returning to his home village. "It was a heartbreaking scene. He could not control his tears for hours," Julhas Uddin said. A dockworker at the port of Chittagong, Mr Sarkar says he illegally crossed the border to India in 1989 in search of better opportunities, without telling his family. "We searched for him for years and finally gave up hope believing he might have drowned in the sea. But our mother always believed that her son would return home one day," Julhas Uddin said. In 1997, he was caught trying to enter Pakistan without valid travel documents, spending the next 15 years in prisons in Lahore and Karachi. He told the BBC he was completely cut off from the world during that time. "I went to Pakistan believing that I would get a better job there. But they caught me at the border," he told AFP. "I wrote dozens of letters to my village address, but did not have any clue that they were never posted. At one stage I lost all hope of returning home." His fate reportedly came to light when Pakistan sent a list of long-serving Bangladeshi prisoners to consular officials, who informed Mr Sarkar's family. They in turn appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross, who facilitated his release.	A Bangladeshi man who went missing for 23 years has been reunited with his family, who had given him up for dead.

President Barack Obama said it was a "step towards a more normal and productive relationship". But he may face a battle in Congress where some Republicans are opposed to his dealings with the communist island. The new ambassador, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, had been working at the new US embassy in Havana, which opened in July last year. President Obama said there was "no better-qualified public servant". President Obama and Cuba's President Raul Castro have begun to reignite the diplomatic relations that were broken off in 1961 after the Caribbean island's communist revolution. What next for Washington and Havana? What is behind the US-Cuba thaw? In pictures: US-Cuban relations Restrictions on flights have been lifted but the US embargo on Cuba remains in place. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, has previously said the improved relations will go "a long way in providing the economic lift that the Castro regime needs to become permanent fixtures in Cuba for generations to come''.	The US has appointed its first ambassador to Cuba in 55 years as relations between the countries thaw.
The treatment isn't offered on the NHS, but it's understood some staff have occasionally put patients in touch with organisations who provide it. Experts say attempting so-called "gay cures" can be "dangerous" and "damaging". Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients. Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them. They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice. The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, "does not endorse or support conversion therapy" and will make this clear to staff. It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it. Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was "really important". "It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling. "We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement." There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen. Amber suggested that an "ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved" rather than staff being "prejudiced against LGB people" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past. "I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past," she said. Newsbeat has spoken to people who said they had experienced conversion therapy. Louise from West Yorkshire said she was blackmailed into receiving "treatment" for being gay in 2007 by her evangelical church. She later attended group sessions of around 20 women near Liverpool. "[Most] were married with children. They were there without the knowledge of their partners or their children. "If I'd been more impressionable I think I could have been really damaged by the process." Brad, from Illinois, lives in the West Midlands. He said he was "scared" when he first discovered he was gay and "wanted to do my very best to change it". He attended group therapy sessions but realised the treatment, which he said encouraged him "to do more stereotypical masculine things" wasn't going to change his feelings. "It's really sad I spent three years of my life trying to do something that was impossible." There are some who suggest it works and insist people should be able to try it. Mike Davidson told Newsbeat he "converted" with therapy over the course of two years and now provides what he calls "support" for people who have "unwanted same-sex attraction" in Northern Ireland. He thinks the service should be allowed but he wasn't able to give an accurate estimate of how widely the treatment was available. He told Newsbeat that gay conversion isn't a "huge industry" and that the people he works with have decided it is something they want to do. "By the time they [clients] get to us, they know what we're about and know what they would like to achieve." Explaining the process, he said: "For some people they want to go as far as controlling their behaviour... they do not want to act out on those issues and we would support them." He also said that he turns people away who appear to have been pressured into taking therapy and admitted that, even when working with someone who wants to change their sexual feelings, a "result" is never guaranteed. The UK Council of Psychotherapy says it intends to expand the agreement to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland soon.

The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) had taken a neutral stance before the 23 June referendum. Members have now met in the wake of the result, and said Brexit was the preferred option. The SFF is due to meet Fisheries Minister Fergus Ewing on Monday for talks about the way forward. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said one of her priorities is to protect Scotland's place in the EU. SFF chief executive Bertie Armstrong said the two standpoints seem to be incompatible. He told BBC Scotland: "There is a gap between the two ambitions. "For the fishing industry it's a complete no brainer - we should be out the EU and out the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)." A Scottish government spokesman said: "As the First Minister has stated, we are intent on pursuing all options to maintain Scotland's EU status. "The first minister also made it clear during questions in parliament yesterday that she is aware of the feelings of the fishing industry and others who did not vote to remain. "Although her priority continues to be the clear majority of people across Scotland who did vote to remain in the EU, she is keen for ministers to engage closely with the industry to listen to their concerns." He added: "We are committed to ensuring Scotland's interests are at the heart of any EU decisions taken on fishing and ministers are continuously engaging in discussions with key stakeholders, this includes meeting with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation again on Monday." The UK voted to leave the EU. The vote north of the border was to remain. A flotilla of fishing boats sailed up the Thames to urge Parliament take back control of British waters last month. The Scottish government said before the result that EU membership was in the "best interests" of Scotland's fishing industry. In 2014, Scotland exported Â£449m of fish and seafood to Europe - 68% of the total value of Scottish food exports into that market. Worldwide, seafood exports are the second largest food and drink export behind whisky, and the industry supports thousands of jobs.	The fishing industry wants out of the EU in the face of Scottish government efforts to keep the country in, ministers are being told.
The Furcast group says the 90-minute podcast went out without its knowledge and it is "deeply sorry". Two Texas stations were among those which broadcast the material, aimed at "furries"- people interested in animals that are given human traits. Broadcasters have been advised to change passwords on the hardware many of them use. Barix streaming boxes are popular with broadcasters and PA professionals. Furcast said that multiple server requests for its content during the incident were in the name of "Barix Streaming Client" and that many of the individual boxes involved were visible on Shodan, a search engine for devices connected via the Internet of Things. The BBC has contacted Barix for comment but the problem appears to be with security settings not being updated by the box owners. "Someone is attacking Barix Boxes," wrote a member of the Alabama Broadcast Association. "Several radio stations and at least one radio network have been compromised. The Barix receiver is pointed to an obscene podcast and its password changed so it can only be reset manually." Furries are people who have a fascination with anthropomorphism and often dress in animal costumes. The furry group Furcast describes itself as "an improv comedy-themed furry podcast with no censor" and denies that its main aim is to create sexual material. "Our content is discovered by individuals who specifically seek what we produce, and they do not normally come into contact with it via public means," they wrote. "We have no interest in being discovered by a mainstream audience." Texas radio station KXAX found itself broadcasting Furcast's podcast on Tuesday. "At about 9am we were notified that a programme was playing on the station that did not originate from this studio," the station wrote on Facebook. "We found out that our equipment had been hacked and was broadcasting a podcast or a stream from an unknown source. "We were able to eventually get the problem resolved. But still want to apologise to anyone who may have heard the programming." KXAX general manager Jason Mclelland told Ars Technica there did not appear to have been a reason for the hack. Another station affected, KIFT, said in a statement that it had only been able to regain control of its output when an engineer physically went to the site of the hacked remote transmitter. "We are working with equipment manufacturers and auditing the security of our own systems to avoid any repeats of this incident," it said.	Several US radio stations played out an explicit podcast to listeners after an apparent hack.
Fifteen-year-old Sarvesh Verma, son of illiterate parents, scored 96.83% in the test and has been widely praised in India for his hard work. In the villages of Uttar Pradesh, the power supply is intermittent and Sarvesh said he mostly had to study under the light of a solar lantern. Although secondary school exams are optional and do not have much significance on their own, they are taken by tens of millions of students every year across India to prepare for the really crucial higher secondary exams. Success stories involving students from poor backgrounds like Sarvesh are not uncommon, but for the moment, Sarvesh and his family are revelling in his success. "My son has brought me immense joy," said his father Swaminath Verma, who owns a tiny plot of land and sells vegetables to supplement his income. "I could not study because of financial problems, so I thought I must send my children to school and wipe out the darkness from their lives," he added. "We knew he will do well, but we didn't know he will be a topper. We never had to ask him to study. He always say he has to study so he can improve our lot," said his mother, Sona Devi. Sarvesh, who lives in Sahsaraav village, has to cycle 10km (6 miles) to reach his school in Haraiyya town. He credits his success to his parents' hard work and co-operation from his teachers. "I got tremendous support from my school teachers," he said. When he grows up, he wants to join the civil service and fight corruption, since the "culture of giving and receiving bribes is a huge problem in our society". "We must think how to eradicate corruption. In my village the public distribution system is in a bad shape. People who deserve subsidised food grains sold through ration shops do not get them. All this must change," he added. In a school competition last year, Sarvesh won a tablet and said he often goes on the internet to see what is going on in the world. But, he added, he is not a fan of social media and is not on Facebook.	The son of a poor Indian farmer who has beaten nearly 3.5 million students to top secondary school exams in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh talks to BBC Hindi about his struggles and ambition.
Fifteen years on, she still is the only black woman to have won the award - and she's not happy about it. Speaking in Cannes last week, the actress said she had been "profoundly hurt" when no black stars were nominated for major acting awards at the 2015 Oscars. Her comments have been followed by the Academy announcing it is inviting 774 new members from 57 countries in an effort to boost diversity. Actors Naomie Harris, Riz Ahmed and Warwick Davis are among those invited to join, with the Oscars organisers saying 39% of the new class are women, boosting the overall female membership to 28%, up three points from 2015. It added that the new membership is also nearly a third non-white, with the number of non-white voters now at 13%, up from 8% two years ago. But Berry said of her Oscar win: "It was probably one of my lowest professional moments." The 50-year-old told Teen Vogue's Elaine Welteroth said she had thought back to the night she won her Academy Award and thought: "Wow, that moment really meant nothing." "I was profoundly hurt by that and saddened by that and it inspired me to try to get involved in other ways," she continued. "Which is why I want to start directing, I want to start producing more [and] I want to start being a part of making more opportunities for people of colour." On the night in question, Berry dedicated her win to "every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance because this door has been opened". Since her victory, though, only four black actresses have been nominated for the best actress Oscar. They include Viola Davis - winner of this year's best supporting actress Oscar - and Ruth Negga, who was nominated this year for Loving. Precious star Gabourey Sidibe and Quvenzhane Wallis, the young lead in Beasts of the Southern Wild, were also shortlisted for the best actress award in 2010 and 2013 respectively. Four nominations in 15 years is hardly something to write home about. Yet it's worth remembering that in the 72 years of Oscar ceremonies before Berry's win, only six black actresses had ever been up for her award. Two of those nominations came in 1973, when Diana Ross and Cicely Tyson - nominated respectively for Lady Sings the Blues and Sounder - lost out to Cabaret's Liza Minnelli. Before that the only black actress to come within touching distance of the statuette was Dorothy Dandridge, who was nominated in 1955 in Carmen Jones. Four black men have won the best actor Oscar since the first ceremony was held in 1929, while nine more have been nominated. The issue of black representation at the Academy Awards became a matter of public concern in 2015 and 2016, years in which no person of colour was nominated for any of the acting prizes. This led to the "OscarsSoWhite" campaign and moves by the Academy to make both its membership and nominations more diverse. So is Berry right to feel aggrieved? We put that question to Sarita Malik, a professor of media, culture and communications at London's Brunel University who specialises in diversity and screen media. "What Halle Berry says reveals the burden of representation that has historically been placed on black actors, films and representations more widely - the idea these have to deal with the persistent problem of under-representation," she told the BBC. "Her disappointment has come to characterise our expectations, where we are led to believe that more and better kinds of diverse representation will follow these rare successes. "The Oscars is a big deal because of its international profile, its legacy and as a barometer of the cultural mood," she continued. "If the Oscars is virtually all-white, as historically it has tended to be, this says something about the kinds of culture we celebrate and support. But it also reveals the kinds of films that are commissioned, funded and made visible through marketing and distribution. "The past couple of years have usefully brought to the fore important public debates about diversity in the film industry and it is a positive step that the Academy's membership is being broadened. "It's important that there is more diversity in leadership but also that, rather than churning out more and more diversity initiatives, the question of why such inequality exists is tackled head-on." Gaylene Gould, writer and head of cinemas and events at BFI Southbank, believes Berry is right to speak out. "She's the only black actress to ever receive a best actress award in the whole history of Oscars so of course she's justified," she told the BBC. "I can totally see why she's depressed." Gould also believes it's significant that while Berry remains the sole best actress winner, seven black actresses have been named best supporting actress. "If a black woman is going to get something it will be best supporting actress," she said. "It rarely goes higher than that." Hattie McDaniel was the first black actress to be named best supporting actress, winning for Gone with the Wind in 1940. The next was Whoopi Goldberg, who won the award for Ghost more than half a century later. "There is a question there about where we position women, where we position black women and how seriously they're taken in cinema," Gould continued. "A lot of what we do at the British Film Institute is all about how you create opportunities and systemically change the fundamental trends within the sector." Last year the BFI launched its Black Star season, a three-month, UK-wide celebration of black screen talent. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The hoard includes red and yellow pigments, shell containers, and the grinding cobbles and bone spatulas to work up a paste - everything an ancient artist might need in their workshop. This extraordinary discovery is reported in the journal Science. It is proof, say researchers, of our early ancestors' complexity of thought. "This is significant because it is pushing back the boundaries of our understanding of when Homo sapiens - people like us - first became modern," said Prof Christopher Henshilwood from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. "These finds indicate that humans were certainly thinking in a modern way, in a way that is cognitively advanced, at least 100,000 years ago," he told BBC News. Blombos Cave on the southern Cape Coast, 300km east of Cape Town, has been giving up remarkable archaeological treasures for more than 20 years. Scientists have been scraping down through its sandy sediments to find all manner of artefacts left by the Middle Stone Age people who occupied the limestone cavity. In 2002, researchers described 70,000-year-old blocks of ochre.  This soft stone contains iron oxides that can be used as a pigment, or colouring agent. But apart from some engravings on the blocks, there was little hard evidence to determine the precise purpose of the Blombos ochre. The new items seem to have had a much more obvious use - as the equipment to process paints. The finds include abalone shells with ochre residues inside. There are tools made of quartzite that were presumably employed to hammer and grind ochre into a powder in the shells. And there is evidence that charcoal and oil from seal bones were being added to the mix. It seems bone implements were also being used to turn and lift the paint pastes. All these artefacts were found together, almost as if someone had put them down intending to retrieve them at a later time, but then never coming back.  Sands blown in through the cave entrance subsequently buried the kits and locked them away until they were excavated in 2008. In the intervening three years, the finds have been subjected to a series of tests and assessments. Ochre can have non-artistic applications such as an additive in glues, but co-researcher Francesco d'Errico from the University of Bordeaux says the analysis of the residues in the shells points strongly to the production of paints. "The absence of a resin or a wax suggests the ochre was not used to make a glue or a mastic. We think it may have been used to make a paint or a design," he explained. Prof Henshilwood added: "It's possible the paint was used to paint bodies, human skin.  It could have been used to paint designs on leather or other objects. It could have been used for paintings on walls, although the surfaces of southern African caves are not ideal for the long-term preservation of rock art." The mere fact though that paints are being manufactured in a systematic way is indicative of a level of advanced thinking. It would have required a high degree of planning to bring together all of the elements of the kits; and if art really was the purpose, it suggests the cave dwellers of Blombos were capable of symbolic thought - the ability to let one thing represent another in the mind. This ability has been posited as the giant leap in human evolution that set our species apart from the rest of the animal world. Understanding when and where this behaviour first emerged is a key quest for scientists studying human origins. Until now, arguably the earliest examples of conceptual thinking were the pieces of shell jewellery discovered at Skhul Cave in Israel and from Oued Djebbana in Algeria. These artefacts have been dated to 90,000-100,000 years ago. The Blombos paint kits now sit alongside these other finds. Prof Chris Stringer from London's Natural History Museum commented: "Twenty or 30 years ago, there was a view that Europe was really the place where all the big action was taking place - wonderful painted caves 30,000-35,000 years ago, and people decorating their bodies. "We now know that this behaviour goes back far further in Africa; it goes back to 100,000 years, perhaps even more than 100,000 years. "People were starting to express social identity in completely new ways.  And there is a view that this behaviour is linked with complex language. So, it may indicate these people were communicating in a fully modern way," he told BBC News.

The motorist received a Â£100 fine and three points on their licence. Dorset Police said when the driver was stopped he said: "I was trying to find that new Sam Smith song on You tube because I didn't have it on my phone." The singer has released the song Writing's On The Wall as the theme to the new James Bond film Spectre. Officers were carrying out checks on traffic offences on Thursday and stopped vehicles which had no insurance as well as others breaking the speed limit. Spectre sees Daniel Craig return as British spy James Bond, aka 007, in a globe-trotting blockbuster named after a sinister criminal syndicate. Two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, French actress Lea Seydoux and Italy's Monica Bellucci also appear in the 24th official entry in the long-running series.	A driver stopped for using his mobile phone told police he was trying to find the new Sam Smith song on YouTube.
They say Argenis Hernandez was shot in the stomach on Friday in the city of Valencia and later died in hospital. Also on Friday, bus driver Wilfredo Rey died after being shot by a group of hooded gunmen in San Cristobal. At least 33 people have now been killed during weeks of protests over the high inflation and basic good shortages. Meanwhile, supporters and opponents of the president staged rival rallies in the capital Caracas on Saturday. This comes a day after riot police in the city  clashed with anti-government demonstrators who were protesting against the arrest of two opposition mayors. The mayors were detained over their alleged role in the unrest. The opposition says the government is violently repressing the protests and trying to silence the administration's critics. President Maduro has blamed the violence on "fascist groups", accusing them of planning a coup against his government. He says he has repeatedly invited them to the presidential palace for talks, but that they have refused to attend. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles said he accepted the invitation but is yet to meet Mr Maduro.	Two people have died from gunshot wounds during protests against President Nicolas Maduro's government, eyewitnesses and local media say.
"Maduro won't be ousted by a referendum because there will be no referendum," Mr Isturiz said. Opposition politicians began the process two weeks ago by handing in a petition signed by 1.85 million people. Meanwhile, the government has published details of the state of emergency it declared on Friday. It said the emergency would last for 60 days and could then be extended for another 60. Mr Isturiz said the opposition had "acted too late" over the recall referendum, had "done it wrong and had committed fraud". The opposition have previously warned the referendum may be hard to push through, as they alleged that the National Electoral Council (CNE) is staffed by government loyalists. Many Venezuelans blame Mr Maduro for the economic crisis the country is experiencing. Its economy contracted by 5.7% last year and is expected to shrink further this year. Inflation is at 180%, according to official figures, and there are shortages of medicines and basic food items. On Friday, President Maduro declared a state of emergency to "denounce, neutralise and overcome the external and foreign aggressions against our country", which he blames for Venezuela's economic problems. In measures published in the government gazette on Monday, the armed forces and local committees will now have powers to distribute and sell food. Authorities will also be allowed to cut the working week in the private sector, as they have done in the public sector, to conserve electricity. The new measures also allow the government to take control of basic goods or services, which analysts say opens the way to the expropriation of companies. On 2 May, opposition politicians handed in 80 boxes containing 1.85 million signatures to the CNE, well above the 1% of voters on the electoral roll needed to kick-start the process. Opposition politicians say the authorities are trying to stall the process and have called on their supporters to march to the offices of the CNE on Wednesday to demand they verify the signatures so the process can go ahead. The timing of a potential recall referendum is key because the outcome could be radically different depending on when it is held. Under Venezuela's constitution, if President Maduro were to be removed by a recall referendum in his last two years in office, he would be replaced by his Vice-President, Mr Isturiz. But if Mr Maduro were to be recalled before that, new elections would be triggered. The opposition sees it as essential to have new elections rather than have Mr Isturiz take power, as he is seen as a loyal member of Mr Maduro's Socialist Unity Party. For new elections to be held, the recall referendum would have to go against Mr Maduro before 10 January 2017.	Venezuela's Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz has ruled out the possibility of a recall referendum being held against President Nicolas Maduro.
He will also answer questions from the audience at the event, which is being held to raise money for charity. The dinner in Edinburgh on 26 May is thought to be one of his first major addresses since his term as president came to an end. The event at the EICC is being organised by The Hunter Foundation. The charity was set up by leading businessman and philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter. Tickets for a table of 10 at the dinner are expected to go on sale for approximately Â£5,000. The Hunter Foundation has previously arranged for US politicians and actors including Bill Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to come to Scotland. Last year, Leonardo DiCaprio travelled to Edinburgh to speak at the Scottish Business Awards at the EICC. He also visited Home, a restaurant in Queensferry Street, which gives its profits to the homeless. Hundreds of fans were waiting for his arrival. Many had queued in the rain for hours. The previous year, George Clooney visited Social Bite in Rose Street. The actor visited the cafe, which donates all its profits to homeless people, leaving $1,000 (about Â£650) for the cause. He stayed at the cafe for around 15 minutes, and greeted the 200-strong crowd who were waiting outside. Mr Clooney shook hands, posed for selfies and chatted with fans. All of the cash raised will be split between children's charities in Scotland and the Obama Foundation, set up by the former president and his wife Michelle. Sir Tom also plans to set aside some seats at the event for local young people. He said: "From the South Side of Chicago to the White House has been an epic, historic journey and it will be a true honour to hear that story from the man who made that journey. "We are both truly proud and delighted to be hosting the 44th president of the United States in Scotland at this event." Sir Tom told the Press Association he is "really chuffed" Mr Obama is coming to Scotland. "We're always looking for really inspiring speakers to come along to Scotland, and really inspire and inform," Sir Tom said. "To be able to get president Obama, we're really chuffed." The entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist also revealed he is planning a special surprise for the 44th US president. He said: "President Obama loves his music, so we're getting some interesting guests." Speaking from New York as she continued her five-day visit to the US, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she was "really excited" about the announcement. Ms Sturgeon added: "Lots of people back home in Scotland will be really looking forward to welcoming President Obama and hearing what he has to say".	Former US president Barack Obama is to make his first visit to Scotland when he addresses business leaders in the capital next month.
The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information said that the social network had not obtained effective approval from WhatsApp's 35 million German users. Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19bn (Â£14.6bn) in 2014 as a way to reach out to a younger audience. It is to appeal against the order. "We will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns," it said in a statement. The data watchdog said that Facebook and WhatsApp were independent companies and should process their users' data as such. "After the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook two years ago, both parties have publicly assured [users] that data will not be shared between them," said commissioner Johannes Caspar in a statement. WhatsApp caused controversy in August when it announced that it was changing its privacy policy to allow its data to be shared with its parent company. It said that better co-ordination with Facebook would help it to fight spam as well as allowing Facebook to offer "better friends suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them". It will share phone numbers and the details of the last time that users signed on to WhatsApp. EU and US regulators reacted with caution, saying that the update needed to be investigated. The UK's Information Commissioner is also looking into the changes.	Facebook has been ordered by a German privacy regulator to stop collecting and storing the data of German users of its messaging app WhatsApp.
The owner of the 1977 Ford Mustang died in August and when his daughter checked his garage in Welwyn Garden City, she found that the car had disappeared. The family last recall seeing the car, registration VTM 648S, in 1995. Hertfordshire Police said: "We have exhausted all lines of inquiry and are waiting for any new information." It is understood the reason the car's disappearance went unnoticed for two decades is the owner was not well enough to visit the garage it was housed in. The force said it was convinced the car was not sold by the owner, as his daughter said she would have been informed, and all of the documentation is still in her late father's house. Police appealed for information about the missing Mustang six months ago but have yet to receive any leads in the case.	Police say they have reached the end of the road in their search for a classic car thought to have been stolen during the last 20 years.
Cosmetic lenses are available to buy on the internet, in novelty stores or at market stalls, close to Hallowe'en. Trading standards officers said the law stated that lenses should be sold with an optician or medic present. Youngsters buying the lenses may wish to recreate the look of the Twilight films and Vampire Diaries TV show. Cosmetic lenses are used to change the colour of the eye, and are also known as plano or zero-powered lenses. Trading standards officers and health experts say young people are known to share them, leading to an increased risk of corneal ulcers and infections. Alistair Bridge, director of strategy at the General Optical Council said: "Opticians make sure that contact lenses fit properly and that wearers receive expert advice on how to wear and store them safely. "They will also offer important advice such as not to sleep in contact lenses and to never share or swap lenses, which can spread eye disease." Leon Livermore, Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive, said: "Cosmetic contact lenses are often made and distributed on a one size fits all basis and not tailored to the wearer's needs which can increase the risk of eye health issues." "We would advise against buying products like these online or from retailers as without professional supervision there are more likely to be health concerns for the individual."	Fans of the Twilight film series have been warned that they could be putting their sight at risk by sharing cosmetic contact lenses bought online.
For the fifth time in six years, it earned the Buckinghamshire golfer a place at the Open Championship - no mean feat for a young man who does not turn 25 until October. Apart from booking a spot at Royal Troon, it earned a place at his first American major - the USPGA at Baltusrol, New Jersey, at the end of July. And his Scottish Open payday of 429,468 euros represents the largest of his five-year professional career. Despite the frustration of seeing so many birdie chances slip away on the back nine to finish a shot behind the victorious Swede Alex Noren, Hatton told BBC Sport: "I'm really happy with that result. "Earlier on in the year, after the start I had, missing a few chances earlier on, there was a good chance my head would have gone down. But my caddie kept me upbeat and positive. "Part of me is slightly disappointed in a way, one short," admitted the Marlow-based former Berks, Bucks and Oxon amateur Hatton, who plays at Harleyford. "But I played well. I tried to stay as patient as I can." Most pertinently, on a day when he secured his fifth top-10 finish in 13 European Tour events in 2016, Hatton particularly showed his nerve with his birdie putt on the final green. There was a lot riding on it. The difference between finishing outright second and in a four-way tie for the runners-up spot amounted to about £150,000. He kept his cool from 10 feet. "That was a huge putt," said Hatton. "I was really happy to see that one drop, and I holed a really good par putt on 17 as well. "Second outright is my best finish on the European Tour. A spot in The Open, as well as securing the PGA Championship - overall, it's been a really good week." His main target at Royal Troon, after missing the cut at his four previous Opens, will be making it through to the weekend. Hatton has a late first-day tee-off time, going out in the penultimate group of the day (16:05 BST) with American Harold Varner III and Swede Oskar Arvidsson. He is due off at 11:04 BST in Friday's second round.	Tyrrell Hatton finished only runner-up at the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart on Sunday - but he still ended up a three-time winner in other respects.
The body will also be responsible for the registration and regulation of youth support workers and work-based learning practitioners. They join more than 75,000 school and further education teachers and learning support staff on the national register. The council's chief executive Hayden Llewellyn said regulating all these groups was a "world-first for Wales". He added it was "a bold and welcome step". "By bringing non-formal and in-work education in line with formal education, we are enhancing the status of the often overlooked professions of youth work and work-based learning and the increasingly important role they play in young people's wellbeing and education," Mr Llewellyn said. Keith Towler, chairman of CWVYS (Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services), said good quality youth work "saves young lives". "The trusted relationship between young people and youth workers and youth support workers is vital for the development of resilience, self-esteem and delivery of professional responses to a huge range of issues," Mr Towler said. "Recognition of informal and non-formal learning in a wider educational context is important and this will support the development of quality youth work provision." Julie James, minister for skills and science, said the new registration system "supports our ambition to achieve the highest possible professional standards throughout the whole education sector and it will provide a vital component in ensuring the people of Wales receive high quality learning throughout their lives".	Wales' youth workers will be regulated by the Education Workforce Council for the first time from 1 April.
Media playback is not supported on this device Real took the lead in the ninth minute through Karim Benzema, but Gaku Shibasaki scored either side of half-time to put Kashima in front. Ronaldo levelled from the penalty spot on the hour mark after Lucas Vazquez was fouled by Shuto Yamamoto. The Ballon d'Or winner put his side ahead in extra time after being played through by Benzema, and completed his hat-trick seven minutes later. Listen: 2016 - the year of Ronaldo? Victory gave Real their second Club World Cup and extended their unbeaten run to 37 games in all competitions. It also means nine of the past 10 winners of the competition have come from Europe. The Champions League winners looked set for a comfortable afternoon when Benzema put them ahead, and they dominated possession in the opening stages. But Kashima - the first Japanese team to reach a Club World Cup final - impressed in an entertaining game, and Shibasaki took both goals well. Indeed, after Ronaldo's equalising penalty, Kashima had the better chances late in normal time. First Keylor Navas saved a long-range strike from Fabricio, then Yasushi Endo shot wide at the back post with the final kick of the 90 minutes. At 3-2 down, Yuma Suzuki hit the bar with a header. The Japanese side also felt Real captain Sergio Ramos should have been sent off in normal time when he appeared to body-check an opponent when on a yellow card. Referees used video replays to review several decisions during the competition, but Janny Sikazwe chose not take a second look at this incident. "The referee lacked courage, which was regrettable," said Kashima coach Masatada Ishii. Victory for Ronaldo capped an impressive year for the forward, coming six days after he won the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best player. He scored the winning penalty in Real's Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in May, before captaining Portugal to Euro 2016 success in the summer. His hat-trick in Yokohama was the first in a Club World Cup final, and he is now the joint-top scorer in the competition's history with five goals. "What a game," said Ronaldo. "We had to suffer, but that's what finals are about. It's a trophy we really wanted to win and we end the year in the best way possible so I'm very happy." Ronaldo has now won the Club World Cup three times, having done so previously with Manchester United in 2008 and Real in 2014. He was already the only player to win the competition with two different clubs. Having taken over as Real coach from Rafael Benitez in January, Zinedine Zidane's first year in management has been remarkable. The Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup have all been won during an unbeaten run stretching back to April. That adds to the former France international's achievements as a player, when he won the World Cup, European Championship, La Liga, Serie A, Champions League, Intertoto Cup, Intercontinental Cup and Uefa Super Cup. Zidane's side, whose last defeat was 2-0 to Wolfsburg in the Champions League, lead La Liga by four points. Match ends, Real Madrid 4, Kashima Antlers 2.

The money for Kingston Maurward College, near Dorchester, will go towards a £3.24m project that includes a new animal sciences building. Weymouth College has also been awarded £0.5m towards its £1.5m project to refurbish two buildings. The grants form part of a £214m investment in 47 colleges in England. Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said of the Enhanced Renewal Grant that it was to "ensure" investment in "first rate facilities". Kingston Maurward principal Clare Davison said she was "thrilled" with the grant. She said the animal science building would include aquatic, reptile and mammal rooms, a laboratory and six teaching classrooms. She added: "This building will help ensure that we continue to deliver high quality teaching and learning to give young people the appropriate skills required to gain employment in animal science-related fields." Construction is planned to start this summer and is expected to be completed by mid-summer 2014. The grants go alongside plans for the government's new skills strategy to "support the majority of good and outstanding colleges" while intervening if colleges are failing.	A further education college in Dorset has received more than £2.88m in government funding to renovate buildings on campus.
The airline had suffered years of financial losses even before it was hit by two major disasters in 2014. Flight MH370 disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and is still missing, while MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Mr Mueller said he was leaving due to "changing personal circumstance." He took up his role in May 2015 to oversee a $1.56bn (Â£1.1bn) turnaround plan which included massive job cuts and dropping unprofitable destinations. "We are very disappointed to lose Christoph as CEO but we fully understand his reasons and respect his need to do this," Malaysian Airlines Chairman Md Nor Yusof said. Mr Mueller will continue to serve until September 2016 and will stay on the board as a non-executive director. The carrier has already begun to look for a new chief executive and says it is considering both internal and external candidates. It said that Mueller had set up a strong management team which would be the foundation for a successful turnaround.	Malaysian Airlines chief executive Christoph Mueller has resigned after less than one year of leading the carrier's reorganising efforts.
Steven Conway died while working at Diamond Wheels (Dundee) Ltd, a firm owned and operated by former Dundee FC director of football Paul Marr. The 33-year-old was sent in to remove debris from a chemical tank with limited protective clothing in August 2011. The firm will be sentenced for health and safety breaches in October. Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Mr Conway sent into the tank containing "volatile" chemicals while wearing only trainers, tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and fleece. The mask he was given did nothing to protect him from the toxic fumes let off by the chemicals, which were used to strip alloy wheels for cars. Co-workers found the father of two unconscious inside the tank, and he was taken to hospital before being pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination found he had suffered chemical burns from contact with hydrofluoric acid. Pathologists concluded he had died from inhaling industrial paint stripper. Prosecutors said the tank Mr Conway was working in was not properly ventilated, the gloves he was given had holes in them and the face mask he was wearing was actually releasing "contaminants" into his air supply. The court also heard that there were no safety protocols in place at the premises, no risk assessment was carried out and there was no safe system of work in place. Defence advocate Gavin Anderson said the company had undertaken extensive efforts to adhere to health and safety standards since Mr Conway's death. He said: "I express publicly in open court that Mr Conway's tragic death is genuinely and deeply regretted by all associated with the company. "He had been a friend of Mr Marr for seven years prior to this and was valued not only as an employee but also as a friend." Diamond Wheels (Dundee) Ltd, registered at Nethergate, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Sheriff Alistair Brown deferred sentence until October for the Crown and defence to make written submissions. Addressing Mr Conway's parents in the public benches, he said: "Nothing that I can say or do will bring him back and I recognise that. "It is certainly not the case in selecting a fine that I will be in any way seeking to put any kind of value on him or his life. "It is important to keep in mind that Mr Conway died as a result of this - he's not to be forgotten in this process."	A Dundee company has admitted health and safety failings after a worker died while cleaning out a chemical tank.
A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is "considering" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: "People just see us as barmaids in the sky. "They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before." In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: "The code of conduct isn't working… We're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem." Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty-free shop to consume on the plane, she was told "officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays "clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. "I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. "Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. "We can't allow it not to change." A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: "We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon." The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, "and will respond in due course". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: "I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly." She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.	Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a Panorama investigation has revealed.
The British Embassy in Rabat said Roger and Mathilde Lamb from Pensham, near Pershore, died in separate falls. A spokeswoman said Mrs Lamb fell from a window of an apartment in the resort of Essaouira while Mr Lamb fell downstairs at a different building a few days later. They both died in hospital. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said the exact circumstances of the deaths were being investigated. The FCO is providing consular assistance to the family. In a statement, the couple's families said they were "deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths". The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira. Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives. He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday. "We heard first of all that he was badly injured. And then on Monday we heard that he had died," he said. Mr Lamb, who was an engineer and a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was working in Christchurch, New Zealand, while his family remained at home in Worcestershire. The families said their main concern was for the couple's children. "Roger and Tilly's families have been deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths while on holiday in Morocco," the statement said. "Our principal concern at the moment is to provide love and support to their four sons who have had to suffer the loss of both a mother and a father in swift succession. "The boys are being well cared for by relatives. "We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the British consular authorities in Morocco for their invaluable assistance." The mayor of Pershore, John Grantham, said people who knew the couple had been saddened by the news. He said: "They're clearly very upset, it's been quite a shock." Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, had relatives in Wiltshire. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police confirmed that her body was being repatriated to the county.	A couple from Worcestershire have died on holiday in Morocco.
That bargain could have backfired in a way that was neither good for his golf nor his social standing. Thankfully for the Spieth family, the lure of the clubs was too strong to resist. Eighteen years on, the obsessive kid has become a record-breaking champion. Ben Crenshaw, another Masters winner schooled in the high winds and heat of Texas, has spoken of looking into the 21-year-old's eyes and seeing the dead-eyed stare of Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp. The final day here at Augusta is often a shoot-out. The pressures of the back nine - greens like glass, fairways steep and narrow, water, water everywhere - have broken older men with far greater experience of these beautiful and brutal yards. Spieth admitted afterwards that he had struggled to sleep on Saturday night, self-effacingly pointing to his prematurely receding hairline as an indication of the stress he has been under. Yet even with so many big guns lurking - world number one Rory McIlroy, three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, major winner Justin Rose - the callow kid never looked like backing down. If it seemed less thrilling a finale than we have come to expect from Augusta, it is worth a reminder of the dramatic context: the second youngest winner in Masters history, the first to go to 19 under (before a bogey on the last), more birdies across his four rounds than any player here has ever made, the first man to win it wire to wire in 39 years. For those who have become desensitised to the scale of his achievement by the very fact that he had led so handsomely throughout, this might help: Rose and Mickelson's score of 14 under for second would have have been the winning tally in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played. Spieth has always been aimed at this day. He won the US Junior Amateur title twice (something only Tiger Woods had ever done before), tied for 16th in the Byron Nelson Championship as a 16-year-old (better than Woods ever managed as an amateur in a PGA Tour event) and became the youngest PGA Tour winner in 82 years when he won the John Deere Classic aged 19 years and 11 months. There is footage of him aged 14 declaring that his ultimate goal in life is to win the Masters. Goals like that are supposed to be good for young sportsmen. They also bring their own burden. Out on the course, beery breath and cigar smoke swirling in the cool breeze, there were groans and gasps when his overnight lead of four strokes was cut to three at only the second hole and again at the seventh. So locked in tradition is Augusta that no radios, phones or tablets are allowed through the gates, which preserves a certain atmosphere but also creates its own strange drama. How was Spieth doing? Was Mickelson closing, was Woods - full of promise of a charge through the front nine - rampaging along as of old? The only indication, for both players and patrons alike, is first when a volley of noise rolls in through the pine trees from a distant hole and then when the large wooden scoreboards are slowly adjusted by a troupe of men climbing up ladders, like stagehands dressing a particularly elaborate set. This sort of information vacuum frays the nerves of those watching, let alone a 21-year-old within touching distance of his greatest ambition. First a hole appears on the board next to the name of the player. Everyone turns and stares. Then, with minimal regard for the anxiety all around, an official will slowly insert a new numbered board. That was how Spieth found out that Mickelson was slipping, that McIlroy was improving too slowly, that Woods - name taken off the board entirely - was not the danger of old. Spieth would not give them a breath of hope. By the 10th - Rose three-putting the ninth - the lead was back to five. In the pine needles on 11, he bumped and ran beautifully to the right of the green before flicking on a wedge that stopped as if he had it on string. The crowds here were willing a Mickelson miracle. No-one is loved in these parts in the same way. Mickelson's avuncular grin, relaxed physique and famed generosity (few waitresses leave Phil's table less than $100 better off) have made him some sort of utopian Everyman for the American golf fan. Spieth's display rendered it instead first a procession and then a coronation. As he slipped on his first Green Jacket, with all the awkwardness that this sometimes painfully corny ceremony can offer, thoughts wandered off already to where he might go next. These debut grand triumphs are a lovely stage for a young sportsman, a point in time where everything seems possible, the future unchecked by the vagaries of injury, form or motivation. Spieth is still young enough to do exactly what his mother tells him - which is a good thing, when she spots you rather lost for words on the 18th green and tells you to congratulate your playing partner and thank the whooping crowd. It is a potent reminder of Woods at the same age, winning his debut Masters by exactly the same score and in the same nerveless fashion. It would take Woods almost two and-a-half years to win his next major. He would reach world number one rather sooner, within two months of his breakthrough at Augusta, and with Spieth already up to second in the rankings that particular piece of history may well repeat. It was easy to pick out what made the young Woods stand out - his huge driving, a power game that would cause even this living museum of golf to be radically altered. Even Spieth has trouble describing the best part of his own game, settling on the rather more prosaic "playing badly well" - what others would call course management and precocious self-control. Crenshaw, poetic in his Masters farewell, spoke of a "jeweller's touch". That does rather better in illustrating how beautifully precise Spieth was in adorning these greens with his short game. The only man who has putted like this at Augusta is Woods. Different characters in different eras, but in their graduation to the wider world with so much to share.	It began early for Jordan Spieth: when he was three years old and ready for potty-training, his mother Chris decided to bribe him out of nappies by hiding his plastic golf clubs on top of the washing machine until he had done what he had to do.
Daly spent two seasons at Ibrox after leaving Tannadice, where he has been training since pre-season. "I would never say never," the 32-year-old said of the possibility of signing for the Scottish Premiership club. "If they came to me and were interested, I would definitely consider it." Daly spent six years at Tannadice and ended as club captain. "I am currently training at Dundee United," he told BBC Scotland. "When pre-season came about and I still hadn't got a club, I rang manager Jackie McNamara and asked if I could go in. "They are a good club with some fantastic young players. "I would never say never, but United would need to want me first." The United States appears to be a possible destination for Daly. "I am probably looking further afield than Scotland," he said. "I'm looking abroad. "At the moment, there are a few clubs interested, but they have their full forum of allocated players so they need to maybe lose one or two of them before they can move. "It is looking like January before the foreign market can come about, so I might need to get something short term until then." Daly had no regrets about his move to Rangers, who helped the Ibrox side win Scotland's third tier before dropping to the bench for much of last season in the Championship. "I was out of contract with Dundee United and at the time they were only prepared to offer a one-year contract," he said. "When I spoke to Ally McCoist, they were prepared to offer two years. "A lot of people say you are dropping down the divisions, which is a fair point, but it is going to a club of Rangers' stature, history, fan base, playing at Ibrox every second week and training at Murray Park every day. "I was just delighted to go to a club like that and play for a man that I really respected in Ally McCoist."	Jon Daly has not ruled out a return to Dundee United, but the striker thinks his future probably lies abroad following his release by Rangers.
After managing to drive down the rate of deforestation for four consecutive years up to 2012, recent figures suggest the forest is being destroyed at a faster pace again. Some of the areas most severely affected are indigenous reserves in the Amazon region. The BBC's Sarah Robbins spoke to a selection of people there about their concerns and the problems they face. Amadeus Cinta Larga is a 25-year-old Cinta Larga tribe member who studies sustainability at the Flower of the Forest village. "We feel like we've been forgotten. The area covered by the reserve is so big that it is tough for us to police it all ourselves. "That's why there are still such problems with illegal logging in the reserve. "And we can't risk our own lives, we have families, too." Siderlei Mason is the director of SM Timber Sawmill, the largest producer of tropical timber in Latin America. "We work with proper certification but the outside world perceives this sector to be one that works mainly illegally. "The forest is rich and beautiful, it benefits people here, and it is beneficial to the world. But I think it should be exploited legally. "We in the logging sector can exploit it in a low-impact way. This is done in various places around the world. "If the government were to give out more concessions in public forests and indigenous areas, it could create a way for people to value the forest more." Lauriano Umbelino Martins is the representative in Matto Grosso state of Funai, the government body responsible for policies relating to Brazil's indigenous peoples. "We don't have enough people working in this area because of budget cuts. "I'm in charge of 11 villages but I can't monitor them all. "There's a lot of wood theft, because of the high value of the wood in the indigenous areas. "And even though the indigenous people know it is wrong, sometimes they help the loggers - because of their poverty. "They need food, they need clothes or medicine, or they want a motorcycle. "But things are getting better, with the help of Ibama [the state-funded institute responsible for environmental protection] and the National Guard and their patrols."	Brazil has been battling deforestation and illegal logging for years.
The women, aged between 18 and 29, have been recruited on social media. Five of them are now living with IS militants in the conflict zones, according to a special investigation by Victoria Police. Concern has been rising since mid-2014 about Australians going to the Middle East to fight for IS. The government will soon introduce legislation allowing it to strip dual citizens fighting in Iraq or Syria of their Australian citizenship. People working in Australia to support militant groups will also be targeted by the changes. Task Force Pax was established in April to monitor Victorians believed to be involved with insurgents. Officials from the task force told local media on Friday that another four Melbourne women made it as far as Turkey before being turned back by authorities. One other was stopped by customs officers in Australia while two remain unaccounted for. The young women are all from Melbourne's northern and south-eastern suburbs. Assistant Commissioner Tracy Linford said two forensic psychologists had been embedded in the task force to help investigators understand why the young women were trying to join IS. "The use of psychologists provides us with a far more comprehensive risk assessment and also assists in identifying early intervention opportunities," she said. "This gives us the chance to focus on identifying those youths most at risk of radicalisation and to engage with them or their families directly." Local media reported that one of the women was 21-year-old Zehra Duman, who allegedly travelled overseas in December to join Mahmoud Abullatif, a Melbourne man believed to be a Islamic extremist. She travelled to Syria without her parent's knowledge, The Age newspaper reported. It is believed Abullatif was killed while fighting with IS in January but Ms Duman has yet to return home. Police said the young women were being sold a romantic view of life with IS, and had lied to their families about their travel plans. Authorities were warning parents and friends of young women about the lure of IS, saying the women could end up in arranged marriages, or forced into sexual servitude in the Middle East. "Our intelligence tells us these women are going over there to meet their partners, to marry somebody in an arranged marriage or be pushed into sexual servitude," Assistant Commissioner Linford told reporters. The Herald Sun newspaper said mother Dullel Kassab was another of the women identified by police. The Australian government believes at least 100 Australians are fighting with militant groups in the Middle East. Another 150 people in Australia are known to be supporting such groups, while Australia's intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), is investigating about 400 high-priority terrorist cases.	As many as 12 young women have tried to leave Melbourne to join the Islamic State (IS) militant group, according to Australian police.
The Care Inspectorate gave Nithsdale House in Pollokshields, Glasgow, a score of one - the lowest possible - across three areas examined. Weaknesses at Drumpellier Lodge in the city's Bargeddie area were also found. The home received the second lowest rating in three areas examined. The inspections took place in February. An unannounced inspection visit was carried out at Nithsdale House, in Shields Road, Pollokshields, on 21 February. The care home, which is run by Lotus Senior Living Ltd, was given a score of one (unsatisfactory) for its quality of care and support; its quality of environment and its quality of staffing. The home's quality of management and leadership received the second lowest score of two (weak). Inspectors also noted that there had been "very little progress" following an earlier inspection which had already highlighted concerns. A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have serious concerns about the quality of care being provided to residents at this service. "Whilst we noted some improvement in some areas following a previous inspection, significant concerns remain over the service's performance in relation to ensuring the health and wellbeing of residents." The spokesman said inspectors had "observed poor practice in relation to administering medication". He added: "We have informed the service of the improvements which it must make to ensure that residents' needs are met and their rights respected. "We will continue to work with them to ensure they improve, but unless we see evidence of significant improvement, we will not hesitate to take further action." An unannounced inspection visit was carried out at Drumpellier Lodge, Coatbridge Road, Bargeddie, on 6 February. The care home, which is run by Clancare Ltd, was given a score of two (weak) for its quality of care and support; its quality of management and leadership and its quality of staffing.Inspectors found that 10 requirements for improvement, made at a previous inspection, were not met. A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have concerns about the quality of care and support being provided at this service and are working closely with them to ensure they meet the standards we expect. "We have told the service the areas it must take urgent action on to improve. "If we are not satisfied that improvement is being made we will not hesitate to take further action."	Inspectors have called for major improvements at two privately-run elderly care homes after finding problems during recent visits.
Evans recorded a time of 55 minutes 40 seconds to take the yellow jersey from Andy Schleck before Sunday's largely ceremonial final stage in Paris. Germany's Tony Martin won the time-trial from Evans, who moved 1:34 ahead of Schleck in the overall standings. Schleck began the day with a 53-second lead in the general classification. The Luxembourger is destined for a third consecutive second place in the Tour after the aggression that secured his stage win over the Galibier on Thursday  appeared to catch up with him. Evans, a general classification runner-up in 2008 and 2009, was visibly emotional as he was presented with the yellow jersey. In the absence of Alberto Contador in 2008, the Australian was widely expected to land his first Grand Tour title but was foiled by Carlos Sastre. "Fortunately this year, we're close to Paris", Evans added after Saturday's dramatic stage. "This is the result of a lot of planning and experience. This is my seventh Tour de France and not having bad luck has been good to me. "In 2008 I suffered so much with my injuries it was the hardest Tour." Evans last wore yellow after stage eight of last year's tour, but his time at the front of the field lasted only a day as Schleck took over in the mountains. Back on the flat in this year's decisive stage, the time-trial specialist, took revenge in ruthless style. The 34-year-old soon eliminated the four-second gap that had separated him from  Schleck's older brother Frank before powering away to register a stage time 2:31 superior to Andy. The Schlecks will have the small consolation of being the first set of brothers to feature in the same Tour de France podium after Frank successfully defended his third place in the overall standings. But barring a freak accident or illness Evans, the road race world champion in 2009, will be crowned Tour de France winner on Sunday. The final 95km run into Paris is traditionally not contested by the general classification contenders as the sprinters take centre stage on the Champs-Elysees. "I really can't quite believe it right now. I have been concentrating on this one event for so long," said Evans, who came within seven seconds of decorating his success with a stage win. Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme added: "This is the victory of a complete rider. It is the consecration of a career." Thomas Voeckler, who held yellow for 10 days before Friday, is fourth in the overall standings after coming 13th on the day with a typically gritty ride. The Frenchman is 37 seconds ahead of Contador, who came third on the day, 1:06 off Tony Martin's winning stage time. After starting in damp conditions earlier in the day, Fabian Cancellara, the world and Olympic time-trial champion and many people's favourite for the stage, was eighth fastest. STAGE 20 RESULT: 1.

Chapman's Ice Cream initially offered to purchase Beavercrest Community School in Markdale for about CA$1m ($741,000; Â£596,000). "This is the community that helped build us to what we are," vice-president Ashley Chapman told the BBC. Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. "Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation," he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. "Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation," he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board. "We all realise that something needs to happen and something needs to change, but whatever happens needs to benefit the students," he said. An alumnus of Beavercrest himself, Mr Chapman said helping isn't just the right thing to do, it's smart business. Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said. The company intends to expand even more, and that means they need to attract people to the small town of Markdale, which has a population of just 1,325. Mr Chapman said he's already struggled to attract people to the area, even after raising wages. "Where are these people going to come from, especially if we don't have an elementary school in this area?" he said.	A Canadian ice cream manufacturer hopes it can give something back to its local community, by keeping an elementary school in Ontario province from shutting down.
The aeroplane is a larger version of its new CSeries aircraft. The Montreal-based plane and train maker is under pressure to bring the CSeries into service after years of cost overruns. The smaller CS100 started testing in 2013. The wings and engine covers of the CS300 jet are made in Belfast. The aerospace company is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. About 5,000 permanent employees and about 1,000 temporary and contract staff work at its Belfast base. Michael Ryan of Bombardier Belfast said: "It is another testament to the skills of our workforce, and our design and manufacturing capabilities, which are helping bring a step change in aircraft wing technology."	Bombardier Inc has launched a test flight of its CS300 jet.

Two armed men wearing masks broke into the 44-year-old victim's house in Meadowbank Terrace at about 00:50. During the assault the men knocked the victim to the ground and hit him repeatedly with a blunt object before fleeing the property. Police Scotland have appealed for witnesses. The first attacker was white with a pale complexion, in his early 20s, 5ft 10ins tall and had dark hair growth on his face, brown eyes and dark unkempt hair. He was of skinny build and was wearing a light grey cotton zip-up tracksuit with the hood up, grey gloves, white Reebok classics-style trainers with air holes and a grey scarf. The second attacker is in his early to mid 20s, between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 8ins tall and of skinny build. He spoke with a local accent. He was wearing an old, black, waist-length outdoor jacket with a dark scarf covering his face and his hood up. He was wearing dark gloves. Det Insp Alan O' Brien, of Police Scotland, said "This is a particularly vicious attack on a disabled man in his own home and we would ask anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Meadowbank Terrace area in the early hours of Monday morning is asked to contact police immediately. "In addition, anyone with any information that can help us with our inquiries and assist in tracing the men responsible should also get in touch."	A disabled man has been left with serious injuries after being attacked in his own home in Edinburgh.
Now, none of her albums are available on the music-streaming service, after the singer removed her entire back catalogue. So far there's been no word from Swift on why she's taken the tracks down. Spotify meanwhile has released a statement saying that the company hopes "she'll change her mind" and return to the site. If you're really desperate for some Taylor Swift - Newsbeat has managed to find two tracks on Spotify that seem to have been left behind. Love Story still features on a compilation called Heart Breakers and The Hunger Games soundtrack has Safe & Sound on it - but there's no guarantee they'll be on there for long. "We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more - nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she's on over 19 million playlists," said Spotify. "We hope she'll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone." They added, in reference to one of her hits, Stay Stay Stay: "PS - Taylor, we were both young when we first saw you, but now there's more than 40 million of us who want you to stay, stay, stay. It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes." Representatives for Swift have yet to return a request for comment. The 24-year-old's fifth album, 1989, was released last week and has topped the album charts in the UK. It sold 90,000 copies, making it the fastest-selling album of the year by a female artist, but it was not put on Spotify. Swift has been outspoken in the past about music piracy and in an article in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, she described how the business models used by some artists have devalued music. "Piracy, file-sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently," she said. "In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. "My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meetâ€¦ is that they all realize their worth and ask for it." Spotify claims that its business model, in which revenue is shared with the "music community", helps to tackle the issue of piracy. "We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy," it said. "That's why we pay nearly 70% of our revenue back to the music community." The site has compiled two playlists in response to her departure, one of which is called What to Play While Taylor's Away. The other - A Little Playlist Poetry for Taylor Swift - features tracks whose titles when read in order say: "Hey Taylor We Wanted to Play Your Amazing Love Songs And They're Not Here Right Now." Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	For the last few weeks, Taylor Swift's Shake it Off has been one of the most streamed tracks on Spotify in the UK.
The 31-year-old has been without a club since leaving English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, where he spent nine years. He did not play at all for Tottenham in the 2014-15 season and spent the previous season on loan with Queens Park Rangers. "Officially at St Etienne so happy - back in football," he wrote on Twitter. Assou-Ekotto has not played for Cameroon since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil when he was involved in an argument with his team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo and even appeared to headbutt him.	Cameroon defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has signed a one-year deal with French Ligue 1 side St Etienne.
Birmingham academies Park View and Nansen Primary - rated inadequate by Ofsted - will have their funding agreements terminated. Park View Educational Trust said it may be removed from running the schools. Oldknow Academy and Golden Hillock School, also rated inadequate, were warned they could lose funding unless concerns were addressed. A head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools said parents tried to undermine her authority and descended on the school during an Ofsted inspection. The head teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she heard parents speaking to an inspector about her. She said she came close to quitting her job on a number of occasions but everything "fell into place" when news of the Trojan Horse letter broke. "From 2012 I felt alone," she said. "I did not know it was happening to other heads. If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed. "I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'" On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover. Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate. 'Islamic-themed assemblies' Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board. In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were "deep concerns" about the way Park View School was run. The letter said: "I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement." Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote "spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils". "I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations," he said. A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated. Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July. A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels. They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools. "What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education," they said. In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement. "Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction," it said. Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July. These included ending "less favourable" treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more "broad and balanced" curriculum. Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash. A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said "a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip" in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an "organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology". 'Own agendas' The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate. It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies. Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating. Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools. He said there had been "upset" among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating. "This is all about moving forward, what happens next," he said. "Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching. "When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding." Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias. Health professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  "alien" to his child's experience at Park View. "â€ŽInspectors came with loaded questions," he said. "People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas." He said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted's findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them.	Two schools at the centre of the Trojan Horse inquiry are to lose their government funding.
The biggest is a $47.5bn (Â£38.6bn) civil claim brought by Brazil's federal prosecutors, the companies said. Under the deal, the firms will provide an initial $681m in compensation. The collapse of the dam, containing waste from an iron ore mine, killed 19 people and created a river of millions of tonnes of toxic waste. It killed 19 people and is Brazil's worst ever mine disaster. The agreement, between the companies and prosecutors, will see experts appointed to advise the federal prosecutors on the impacts of the dam disaster and any changes that might be needed to social and environmental remediation programs agreed last May. It does not cover the potential size of the final liabilities to be agreed by the end of June. BHP spokesman, Paul Hitchins, said the settlement simplified matters: "This spells out how and when we are going to settle this with the prosecutors. "Up until this time we had all these different courts hearing the case. This consolidates all that." The companies said they still had not agreed how and when the mine would be able to re-open. They said any restart was subject to separate negotiations and would only happen once it was safe to do so and economically viable. It also needed the support of the devastated local community.	BHP Billiton and Vale have agreed a deadline of 30 June to consolidate and settle claims resulting from Brazil's Samarco dam disaster in 2015.
Judge Thomas Lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in Steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge Lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The Ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in West Virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last August. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group Anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 March.	An Ohio judge has ruled that the rape trial of two high school football players will take place in the county where the alleged attack happened.
Media playback is not supported on this device Former world player of the year Messi, 27, has inspired Argentina in Brazil. The Barcelona forward has scored in all three games and is one goal shy of Maradona's 1986 five-goal haul, but Mehmedi says it is not all about Messi. "With all due respect for his qualities and class, I think too much is talked about just Messi," said Mehmedi, 23. Media playback is not supported on this device "He is exceptional, no question, but that is not all, he has very good players around him. We will not neglect the preparation nor in the game itself," the Freiburg striker said ahead of their last-16 clash. Argentina are unbeaten in their six previous games against Switzerland but Mehmedi says his side are not heading into the game at Corinthians Arena just to make up the numbers against one of the pre-tournament favourites. "Swap jerseys with Messi? I'm not here as a tourist," he said. "Switzerland is in the second round of a World Cup." Mehmedi knows if his side can defeat Argentina in Sao Paulo they will cause one of the biggest shocks of the 2014 tournament in Brazil. "I know the quality and potential of this team," he continued. "If we defeat Argentina, we write a piece of World Cup history and many people in Switzerland will be proud of the team. "I even think such success would see the world take notice, but we are not naive. "It will take an absolutely top performance of each one of us. And I assure you, everyone will do everything we can to provide these and tearing for Switzerland."	Lionel Messi is not the only threat in the Argentina team, according to Switzerland's Admir Mehmedi ahead of Tuesday's last-16 World Cup clash.
A former Spanish colony, it was annexed by Morocco in 1975. Since then it has been the subject of a long-running territorial dispute between Morocco and its indigenous Saharawi people, led by the Polisario Front. A 16-year-long insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence which has yet to take place. Although under the de facto administrative control of Morocco, the status and sovereignty of Western Sahara remain unresolved and numerous direct talks have failed to break the political deadlock. The Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), declared by the Polisario Front in 1976, is now recognised by many governments and is a full member of the African Union. Home to phosphate reserves and rich fishing grounds off its coast, Western Sahara is also believed to have as yet untapped offshore oil deposits.

Brahim Ghali was elected leader of the Polisario Front and president of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in July 2016 following the death of long-term president Mohamed Abdelaziz Ezzedine. A seasoned military leader, described both as a "hard-line supporter" and "historic figure", he was one of Polisario's founding members in 1973 and led the first raids against the occupying Spanish forces that sparked the armed struggle for Western Saharan independence. In 2008 he left his post as ambassador to Spain with unresolved charges against him alleging inhumane treatment and the torture of Saharan prisoners, and became the ambassador to Algeria. Morocco's state broadcaster RTM operates radio and TV services from Laayoune. On the other side of the political divide, a Polisario-backed mediumwave (AM) radio station is on the air. Radio Television News agency Some key dates in the history of Western Sahara: 1884 - Spain colonises Western Sahara, an area formerly populated by Berber tribes. 1934 - Becomes a Spanish province known as Spanish Sahara. 1957 - Newly-independent Morocco lays centuries-old claim to Western Sahara. 1965 - The UN calls for the decolonisation of Western Sahara. 1973 - Polisario Front, the indigenous Saharawi independence movement, is founded. 1975 - Morocco's King Hassan defies a Hague ruling in favour of Saharawi rights to self-determination and stages the "Green March" of 350,000 Moroccans into Western Sahara. Spain transfers administrative control to Morocco and Mauritania. 1975-91 - Polisario Front fights a 16-year-long guerrilla war against Moroccan forces, which ends with a UN-brokered cease-fire. 1975-76 - Morocco annexes two-thirds of Western Sahara after colonial power Spain withdraws. Polisario guerrillas declare the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), with a government-in-exile in Algeria. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees flee to western Algeria to set up camps near the town of Tindouf. 1979 - Mauritania renounces all claims to Western Sahara leaving Morocco to annex its share of the territory. 1991-2000s - UN brokered cease-fire ends war but Morocco has yet to hold an agreed referendum on independence. Numerous UN-sponsored talks have failed to yield a breakthrough. 2016 - Long-term leader Mohamed Abdelaziz Ezzedine dies.

Lucio Barani was said to have gestured in the direction of Barbara Lezzi from the opposition Five Star Movement (M5S) on Friday. Vincenzo D'Anna is thought to have repeated the gesture. Female senators from various parties responded, demanding that Mr Barani apologise. The Senate speaker suspended Friday's debate on Italy's constitutional reform bill in the subsequent pandemonium. The two centre-right senators insisted their actions were misunderstood, but were nonetheless suspended by the speaker's council on Monday. The speaker said the incidents were "so serious they offended persons and senators, and undermined the credibility of the institutions," news agency Ansa reported. M5S Senator Alberto Airola was also suspended for a day for insulting members of government.	Two Italian senators have been suspended for five days after allegedly making obscene gestures at female colleagues during a senate debate.
The 24-year-old ex-Manchester United forward will stay at the City Ground until the end of the season. Macheda has not started a Championship match this season, with all but one of his eight appearances for the Bluebirds coming as a substitute. Meanwhile, Forest midfielder David Vaughan has signed a one-year contract until the summer of 2017. But Andre Moritz, who Forest were chasing, will not be joining the club. The deal for midfielder Moritz fell through because of complications getting him released from his contract with Thai Premier League side Buriram United. Macheda began his career at Old Trafford and played for QPR, Stuttgart, Doncaster Rovers and Birmingham City on loan before joining Cardiff in May 2014. He has only started 13 league games for the Welsh side and boss Russell Slade said they wanted him to "go and get a few games" - but confirmed there would be a 24-hour recall clause in any deal.

Monarchs are the only insects to migrate such a vast distance. So, by teaming up with biologists, mathematicians set out to recreate the internal compass they use to navigate on that journey. The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports. Lead researcher Prof Eli Shlizerman, from the University of Washington, explained that, as a mathematician, he wants to know how neurobiological systems are wired and what rules we can learn from them. "Monarch butterflies [complete their journey] in such an optimal, predetermined way," he told BBC News. "They end up in a particular location in Central Mexico after two months of flight, saving energy and only using a few cues." Prof Shlizerman worked with biologist colleagues, including Steven Reppert at the University of Massachusetts, to record directly from neurons in the butterflies' antennae and eyes. "We identified that the input cues depend entirely on the Sun," explained Prof Shlizerman. "One is the horizontal position of the Sun and the other is keeping the time of day. "This gives [the insects] an internal Sun compass for travelling southerly throughout the day." Having worked out the inputs for this internal compass, Prof Shlizerman then created a model system to simulate it. This consisted of two control mechanisms - one based on the timekeeping "clock" neurons in the butterflies' antennae and the other from what are called azimuth neurons in their eyes. These monitor the position of the Sun. "The circuit gets those two signals then matches them, according to how it's wired, to control signals that tell the system if a correction is needed to stay on the correct course," explained Prof Shlizerman. "For me this is very exciting - it shows how a behaviour is produced by the integration of signals," he added. "We can take these concepts to produce robotic versions of these systems - something [that is] powered by and that navigates by the Sun." Prof Shlizerman said that one of his team's goals was to build a robotic monarch butterfly that could follow the insects and track their entire migration. "It's a very interesting application that could follow the butterflies and even help maintain them. "Their numbers are decreasing, so we want to keep this insect - the only one that migrates these huge distances - with us for many years." Prof Matthew Cobb from the University of Manchester told BBC News that the study showed that "something as astounding as the monarch migration can be understood in terms of cellular circuitry". "Our current robots are far cruder than even the simplest nervous system," he added.

The images were taken by photographer Nick Hedges in the 1960s and 1970s for housing charity Shelter in some of the country's biggest cities. He said the conditions some families lived in "shocked me to the core". An exhibition will be held later this year in Sheffield, Birmingham and Manchester to mark Shelter's 50th year. The images were taken in Birmingham, Manchester, Salford, Newcastle, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, London and Liverpool. Mr Hedges said: "It would be wonderful to meet the children I photographed all those years ago and for them to be able to tell their stories. "I often wonder what happened to them, if they went on to lead happy and healthy lives." "When I was commissioned by Shelter to take these photographs, I never imagined that decades later they would still have such impact," said Mr Hedges. "The poverty and terrible conditions I witnessed shocked me to the core. "I hope that all these years later, by reconnecting with some of those I photographed, I am able to hear good news of what happened to the families." Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive, said: "We would love to hear the stories of the people behind these iconic pictures to help us mark 50 years of fighting bad housing and homelessness. "I'd encourage anyone who recognises themselves, or family members and friends, to get in touch and let us know what happened after they were taken." "These photographs are a sobering piece of history not only for Shelter, but the nation as a whole, and it's important to preserve the stories behind them. "They show us how far we have come, but also that we must do more for the tens of thousands of families and individuals still desperate for a safe, secure and affordable home." The charity is asking anyone who recognises themselves or anyone else in the images to email: stories@shelter.org.uk or call: 020 7505 2032. For a full gallery of images go to click here.	An appeal has been launched to trace the families featured in a series of pictures taken in some of England's poorest and most deprived areas.
Profits fell to £14m compared with £32m a year earlier. That fall is partly due to the costs of last year's serious cyber attack,  which cost the company £42m. Dido Harding, TalkTalk chief executive told the BBC: "We have significantly increased our spending on security. We take this extremely seriously." Talktalk lost 101,000 subscribers in its third quarter after the attack, which resulted in the personal data of nearly 160,000 people being accessed. The data haul netted email addresses, names and phone numbers. 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes were accessed in the attack. There have been six arrests in the UK connected with the hacking, all of them of individuals under 21 years old. Ms Harding said: "I am actually very encouraged by the way the business has bounced back so strongly in the last quarter. "The customer base has really stabilised and this is testimony to the fact that our customers really appreciated our open and honest approach and how we tried to look after them through the cyber attack." She added that Talktalk's customer "churn" - the turnover of customers - has been the lowest in TalkTalk's history, suggesting customers are satisfied with the company's service. TalkTalk says total revenues grew 2.4% to £1.83bn in the 12 months to 31 March.	Telephone and broadband provider Talktalk saw profits more than halve following a hack attack on its systems last October.

Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: "It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points. "In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball. "But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to. "I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving."

Lee Gregory could have put the Lions ahead, but shot over from close range. Visting goalkeeper Jordan Archer made a fine save to deny Elliot Lee before Gregory and Chris Taylor both missed chances at the other end. Taylor almost sealed three points for Millwall late on but his defected effort hit the post, meaning the Londoners drop to sixth in the table. They are four points ahead of Barnsley, who have a game in hand, while Colchester remain in 23rd place, still seven points adrift of safety. Millwall boss Neil Harris told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "I don't think we were really quite as clinical as we have been. "I thought we were very lacklustre in the first half and never really imposed our tempo on the game. "I think we can focus on the fact that it's a really good clean sheet, it's another point gained. "Having said that, I'm obviously disappointed. I thought we should have come here and won today."	League One strugglers Colchester United had to settle for a point against play-off chasing Millwall.
Ian Stewart, 56, denies murdering Helen Bailey at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, in April. Her body was found in July, dumped in a cesspit under the garage. St Albans Crown Court heard Mr Stewart told a psychiatric nurse he had thought about taking his own life. Follow updates on this story and other Hertfordshire news The nurse Sarah Tooley told the jury she had spoken with Mr Stewart on the phone in May. He had been to visit Broadstairs in Kent where Ms Bailey had a holiday cottage. "He'd had thoughts of jumping off a cliff while he was down there," said Ms Tooley. Earlier, the court was told Mr Stewart had tried to divert a police search of the garage. According to a statement from Det Con Hollie Daines, read to the court, Mr Stewart said: "If searches are going to take place, you wouldn't find anything in the garage." When they arrived, DC Daines said Mr Stewart told her he had considered suicide. She said: "He appeared to be anxious and uncomfortable with what we were asking of him." On the day of Ms Bailey's disappearance, Mr Stewart claimed he found a note from the Electra Brown author saying she had gone to the holiday cottage in Broadstairs. According to a statement read to the court, he told police: "If Helen does come back, I don't think I want to be with her any more." Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, denies charges of murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.	The fiancÃ© of a children's author considered throwing himself off a cliff two months before he was charged with the killing her, a court has heard.
Police and the Ambulance Service received reports that a grey Toyota Rav4 had left the road and collided with a sign just after 14:00. The northbound lanes of the A90 were closed while an air ambulance attended, however, the driver died at the scene. A woman who was a passenger in the car was not injured. Anyone with information should contact police.	A 60-year-old man has died following a crash on the A90 just north of Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire.
But the co-founder and chief executive of UK chocolate shop chain Hotel Chocolat says he was actually inspired to set up his own business after seeing the success of his father's other company - a printing firm. Since the first Hotel Chocolat store opened in 2004 the company has gone on to grow into a multi-million pound empire, with 81 shops, eight cafes, two restaurants, and a hotel. As soon as Mr Thirlwell, 51, starts talking, there's no mistaking what drove the firm's evolution. He speaks about chocolate with such evangelical zeal he is bouncing up and down in his chair. Talking wistfully about the 18th Century, when chocolate houses were all the rage in London, Mr Thirlwell admits that his fantasy is to "make cocoa the hero" again - educating people to recognise and appreciate the higher cocoa content in the chocolate Hotel Chocolat produces compared to some of the best-known brands. "We want consumers to be having the same debate about the flavours of different cocoa beans as wine," he says. Mr Thirlwell's desire to educate extends to leaving chocolates he thinks people should like on the shelves even when they're not selling. The firm's 100% dark chocolate products, for example, took five years to become profitable. Yet using large amounts of cocoa doesn't come cheap, and the firm's "Signature Cabinet", which has three drawers full of chocolates, costs a whopping £160. But Mr Thirlwell says the pricing makes sense if you look at the cost of the cocoa hit, as well as the packaging. He points out that by contrast, the firm's entry level "Selector" range starts from £3.75. "It's very important to us that we're accessible," he adds. Such a wide-ranging pricing structure seems to work with customers, as the company enjoyed sales of £70m in the year to the end of June 2013. And it is continuing to expand apace. Hotel Chocolat's rapid development has been helped by the creation of innovative chocolate bonds, through which it has raised around £5m from investors, to whom it pays "interest" in chocolate. Mr Thirlwell picked up the business bug working for his father's printing firm in his school holidays. He says it gave him a strong sense that running a company was "exciting". Nonetheless, he "didn't have a clue" what he wanted to do with life until he got a job at a French hi-tech firm as part of his French and economics degree. The lure of business was so strong, he dropped out of his course altogether, staying on in France to help the company export its products. It was on his return to the UK that Mr Thirlwell met Hotel Chocolat's co-founder Peter Harris, who interviewed him for a sales and marketing job at another tech firm. They hit it off so well that just 10 months later, they left together and in 1987 set up Hotel Chocolat's forerunner - The Mint Marketing Company (MMC), which sold packaged mints branded with company logos. Mr Thirlwell got the idea for the business after his father told him that the most successful promotion the printing company had been involved with was for such a product. To fund MMC Mr Thirlwell and Mr Harris both took out £5,000 personal loans. Unfortunately, the wrapping machine they'd bought didn't work, and they had to hand wrap 20,000 packs to make their first order. Mr Thirlwell admits many people would have seen this as a sign that it wasn't meant to be, but he says that this is "rubbish". "Lots of businesses have some early setbacks," he says. "You've just got to overcome them somehow. "These things happen all the time even when you're established. You just swat them away more easily." MMC evolved into Choc Express when their customers asked if they had anything beyond mints, and they started selling chocolates online in 1993, becoming one of the UK's earliest e-retailers. Then in 2004 they opened their first store in Watford, after changing the name of the business to Hotel Chocolat. But why would a retail business wish to call itself a hotel? Mr Thirlwell says: "It was aspirational. I was trying to come up with something that expressed the power that chocolate has to lift you out of your current mood and take you to a better place." "Everyone agreed 'chocolat' sounded better than chocolate. It's almost onomatopoeia, and suggests how the chocolate melts in your mouth." A decade later, the business does own a hotel, which it built in Saint Lucia beside its own cocoa plantation, which provides some of the cocoa for its chocolates. The company also now has two restaurants, one in London and one in Leeds, serving sweet and savoury dishes that include cocoa. Plus it has stores in Copenhagen. And from originally outsourcing production of its chocolates, Hotel Chocolat now makes them all itself at its own factory in Cambridgeshire. Despite Hotel Chocolat's expansion, not a single part of the range gets onto the shelves without first being approved by Mr Thirlwell. He chairs a tasting session every Wednesday, where they try new recipes and combinations, and calls this the "triage" of the brand quality. "It's the beginning of the product, so if I let anything past there that I'm not happy with - it could affect the brand." Customers can also get in on the act via the firm's Tasting Club - a monthly box of new chocolates which members test and score. The club now has 100,000 members who have given the business a vast range of data on the public's tastes. A chocolate containing thyme oil has so far scored worst, generating "sackfuls of mail". "But if you get bull's-eyes for all of them you almost think you're not pushing the boundaries enough," says Mr Thirlwell. He admits pushing boundaries is also part of "future proofing" the business. "If you're specialist you've got to be absolutely specialist. There's a lot of competition and we want to be in the driving seat."	As the son of the man who helped build the Mr Whippy ice-cream brand, it may seem that Angus Thirlwell was destined for a career in confectionery.
Cafodd Cerys Yemm ei lladd gan Matthew Williams, 34, ym mis Tachwedd 2014 yng ngwesty'r Sirhowy Arms yn Argoed, Sir Caerffili. Cafodd Mr Williams ei saethu gyda gwn Taser gan yr heddlu a bu farw'n ddiweddarach. PC Kelda Griffiths oedd y cyntaf i gyrraedd y llety, a'r ail i fynd fyny'r grisiau ac i mewn i'r ystafell. Dywedodd wrth y rheithgor nad oedd Mr Williams "yn ymddangos yn ddynol" a'i fod yn "ddiafolaidd". "Roedd e fel rhywbeth byddech chi'n ei weld ar y teledu, nid rhywbeth 'dych chi'n disgwyl ei weld mewn bywyd go iawn," meddai. Dywedodd ei bod yn gorffen ei sifft yng ngorsaf heddlu'r Coed Duon pan glywodd ar y radio bod llofruddiaeth wedi digwydd. Wrthi iddi fynd i'r Sirhowy Arms, clywodd mai Mr Williams oedd y dyn dan amheuaeth. Oherwydd hynny, meddai, penderfynodd aros am ragor o gefnogaeth cyn mynd i mewn. Roedd hi wedi delio â Mr Williams yn y gorffennol ac yn ymwybodol o adegau eraill pan gafodd ei saethu yn aneffeithiol â gwn Taser. Pan aeth hi a swyddogion eraill i fyny'r grisiau, dywedodd ei bod yn gallu clywed "chwyrnu, sŵn ysgyrnygu, rhuo". Dywedodd ei bod eisoes wedi tynnu ei gwn Taser allan yn barod i'w ddefnyddio pan aeth hi mewn i'r ystafell, ond yn y diwedd ni wnaeth hi ei ddefnyddio. Roedd swyddog arall eisoes wedi defnyddio Taser ar Mr Williams, ond dywedodd PC Griffiths nad oedd hi'n siŵr a fyddai'n cael effaith oherwydd y man y cafodd ei saethu a'r ffaith ei fod wedi cael ei saethu gyda Taser yn y gorffennol. Fe wnaeth hi a swyddog arall fynd ati i rwystro Mr Williams gyda gefynnau a rhwymau tra bod PC Alan Cotterell yno'n barod i'w saethu gyda Taser eto os oedd yn parhau i'w gwrthsefyll. "Roedd e'n hynod o gryf," meddai PC Griffiths. "Roedd e'n brwydro, yn straffaglu, doedd dim modd ei reoli." Dywedodd y byddai'n tawelu bob tro roedd yn cael ei saethu, cyn dechrau straffaglu a brathu unwaith eto ychydig eiliadau'n ddiweddarach - ond ar ôl iddo gael ei saethu am y tro olaf fe aeth yn llonydd. Roedd hi'n "ymwybodol iddo gael ei saethu gyda Taser hyd at dair gwaith", meddai - ond roedd hi'n bendant nad oedd hi'n un o'r swyddogion wnaeth ei saethu. Dywedodd Lloyd Williams QC, ar ran teulu Ms Yemm, bod mam Ms Yemm wedi ei "phoenydio" gan y syniad y gallai oedi cyn i'r swyddogion fynd i mewn i'r ystafell fod wedi arwain at farwolaeth ei merch. Honnodd bod PC Griffiths wedi aros am dri munud cyn mynd i mewn i'r ystafell, a'i bod wedi cael pedwar cyfarwyddyd i fynd i mewn yn y cyfnod yna. Ychwanegodd bod PC Griffiths wedi "gwrthod" bob tro. Dywedodd PC Griffiths nad oedd hi wedi aros am fwy na munud cyn i swyddogion eraill gyrraedd, a'i bod wedi oedi oherwydd pryder am ddiogelwch ei hun, pobl eraill yn y gwesty a swyddogion eraill. Dywedodd wrth y cwest: "Doeddwn i ddim yn gwybod pa arfau oedd ganddo [Matthew Williams]. Er mwyn diogelwch swyddogion eraill fe wnes i asesu'r risg." Ychwanegodd: "Doeddwn i ddim yn credu ei fod yn ddiogel i fi na nhw fynd i mewn ar ben ein hunain." Mae'r cwest yn parhau.	Mae swyddog heddlu aeth i'r gwesty ble cafodd dynes 22 oed ei lladd wedi dweud wrth gwest nad oedd hi'n siŵr os fyddai hi'n goroesi pan aeth hi mewn i'r 'stafell.
MSC Oscar is shorter in length than the previous holder the CSCL Globe, which docked in Felixstowe in January, but can carry 124 more containers. It is 396m (1,300ft) long and has a capacity of 19,224 standard containers. Clemence Cheng, chief executive of Port of Felixstowe, said it was a "very happy day" for the port. More than 200 people lined the beach between the public viewing platform and Landguard Point to welcome the ship's arrival, although the ship was not carrying a full load. Barrie Bridle, 57, from Southampton, was spending the week in Felixstowe to see the ship. "I work in the marine industry and we get a lot of shipping in Southampton, but it's always nice to see something different and we don't get them that big in our port," he said. "She'll be just as impressive going out, hopefully with a few more boxes on her." Graham Meadows, 60, from Ipswich, said he had a "fascination" with its size. "I missed the Globe in January because I was away, so I got down here early this morning," he said. "I've just finished a night-shift, so I'm tired and I want to go to bed, but I also hope to come down at night and photograph it before I go to work. "My partner understands my interest in photography, so she accepts it whether it's wildlife or anything else." Source: MSC The MSC Oscar had sailed from Wilhelmshaven in Germany and will leave Felixstowe on Tuesday before heading to Rotterdam in The Netherlands and then on to China via Algeciras in Spain and the Suez Canal. Mr Cheng said MSC had worked with the port for the past 30 years and that its continued business, despite the added option of London Gateway, was a "seal of approval". "We're giving them the service that they want," he said. "It's good for the port, good for Suffolk and good for the country." The size of a container ship is defined in terms of its load capacity.	The newly-crowned largest container ship in the world has arrived at Felixstowe for its first visit to the UK.
The Gold Hill Cheese Run sees entrants run up the cobbled Shaftesbury street with a 55lb (25kg) cheese. The event, based on activities of cheese traders in years gone by, began in 2012 as part of the town's food festival. Barnaby Cox, 18, who has won the race twice, has put his success down to "technique and power". Organiser Charlie Turnbull said the event was a tribute to a millennia of cheese making in the Blackmore Vale, with "slightly mad" participants racing with the locally-made cheeses which are 35cm (14") in diameter. "Each one takes up to 500 pints of milk - that's a lot of effort from a lot of cows. But they are not very convenient to carry up a hill." The street was made famous when it was used in a Hovis bread television advertisement filmed by Ridley Scott in 1973. It depicted a boy struggling to get up the street on his bicycle to deliver bread to the sounds of Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony.	A cheese-carrying race up a famous Dorset street is due to take place later.
Two other injured men were taken to hospital, where a 25-year-old with knife wounds is in a critical condition, West Midlands police said. A 22-year-old is being treated for gunshot injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening. Four of the arrested men are suspected of violent disorder, and the fifth man of possessing a class-A drug. The dead man has been named locally as Ikram Elahi. One witness claimed "about 200 to 300 lads" had gathered in the area around Stratford Road in Sparkbrook prior to the killing on Wednesday evening. 'Pool of blood' The A34 Stratford Road was closed throughout Thursday morning but reopened at lunchtime. Farm Road and Grantham Road remain sealed off as part of the police investigation. Supt Bas Javid, from Birmingham East Police, said it was unsettling for communities when guns or knives are used. "There is nothing to suggest there will be any further issues," he said. "We would encourage people not to speculate and I would reiterate that there is nothing to suggest this will spark any further disorder." Following a private meeting held for residents at the Christ Church centre on Sampson Road,  Mohammed Ashraf, a member of the Sparkbrook Faith Forum, said: "We urge all families to look carefully into their hearts in this holy month of Ramadan and hand in any information they have. "Any individuals involved in this, could they please report to the police." One shopkeeper, who did not want to be named, said he had been leaving the area on a bus when he spotted the scene. "I saw a man lying in a pool of blood by the side of the road," he said. "People were surrounding him and trying to help. I didn't understand what I was seeing, whether he had been shot or stabbed. "It has made me scared. I'm worried about my shop." Ann Taylor, who lives locally, said she also was worried about the area: "I'm not surprised what happened here really, it's not very nice. "I'm not very happy now. I feel like I can't go out at night any more. " A second shopkeeper, who also did not want to give his name, said he had been locking up for the day at about 19:20 when he saw a "large group" had gathered. "There were about 200 to 300 lads hanging around, it was a large number," he said. "Then after that lots of police came down. He added: "It does happen around here, groups fighting among themselves. "You do see large groups of young lads hanging around, but it doesn't usually escalate to this kind of violence." Birmingham City Councillor Mariam Khan said: "Any loss of life is a waste, especially young life." She said, as chair of the social cohesion and community safety committee on the council, she would look closely at issues around gun and knife crime and "focus on what makes young people turn to violence". Parish priest of the Small Heath area of Birmingham, Father Oliver Coss, offered his condolences and said: "The only thing we harvest from the guns and knives on our streets is another generation of orphans and widows." A post-mortem examination will take place in due course to determine the cause of death, officers said.	Five men remain in police custody in connection with the fatal shooting of a 28-year-old man in Birmingham.
Robin Hood, also known as Tim Pollard, appropriately met Sally Chappell at a banquet at the city's former Sheriff's Lodge venue. The couple now have a two-year-old daughter called Scarlett. Instead of wedding presents they have asked for donations towards a relaxing space for Ms Chapell, who has incurable breast cancer. Mr Pollard, 52, said: "I think one of the first times I met her, I threw axes at her as part of the show. "I can't say that will work as dating advice for everyone, but it did for me." Speaking about his fiancÃ©e's cancer diagnosis, he said: "We both had a bit of a weep and now we are just carrying on anyway. "We were planning on getting married, so that's what we're doing." Mr Pollard has been playing Nottingham's famous outlaw for more than two decades. He was in need of a Maid Marian so he asked Ms Chappell, who was also into re-enactments. "It's the best chat-up line in the world really - 'Will you be my Maid Marian?'," said Mr Pollard. "Except it wasn't a chat-up line. We worked together as Robin and Maid Marian for years just as friends and neither of us thought about going out with each other. "And then five years ago, we just kind of went 'You know this pretending to be in love thing that we're doing? I quite like you' and we got together." Ms Chappell, 39, is also a lecturer and researcher in human molecular genetics at the University of Nottingham. "You can't pull the wool over her eyes about the seriousness of her condition because of her work but she has just been amazing with it," said Mr Pollard. Ms Chappell said: "We've been a couple for several years now and even have a beautiful two-and-a-half-year-old baby daughter, Scarlett, so maybe it's time for me to make an honest man of Robin." The couple are getting married later this month in Buxton, Derbyshire. Guests will include the Pied Piper of Hamelin, from Germany. Even Robin Hood's arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham, has wished the couple well on their big day. Jackie Morris, who holds the ceremonial role of the Sheriff, said: "I'm delighted the legendary love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, better known locally as Tim and Sally, is going to be celebrated on their wedding day. "Tim dubbed me the 'nice' Sheriff, but even so I will leave him in peace on his wedding day. I'm sure family, friends, their daughter Scarlett and the Merry Men will help them celebrate in style. "Myself and the whole of Nottingham will be celebrating with them in spirit and we wish them all the best for a happy wedding day."	Nottingham's official Robin Hood is to marry Maid Marian after they fell in love while playing the famous couple.
That was a 20% increase on the same period last year. The profit was achieved on turnover of £152m, up from £117m the previous year. First Derivatives makes financial analysis software used by investment banks all over the world and the firm now employs more than 1,750 people. They also provide consultancy services and are diversifying into new markets, primarily marketing technology and utilities. Chairman Seamus Keating said they have made an encouraging start to the current financial year. "We are engaged in numerous discussions across industries and believe our products and services are well placed competitively. "Consequently we anticipate another year of strong growth," he said. The firm was founded by Brian Conlon in 1996 and floated on the stock market in 2002. At that time, it had just 26 employees and a turnover of less than £2m. It is understood that the company is planning to develop a significant amount of new office space close to its existing headquarters in Newry. That will be largely to accommodate the growth in its managed services business	First Derivatives, the financial technology firm based in Newry, County Down, made £12.5m profit before tax for the year to the end of February.
Sergeant Randy Johnson, 34, was killed in an explosion near Baghdad in 2007, Woolwich Crown Court heard. The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: "This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq. "The Crown's case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. "As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times." He explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs "were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent". They were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device (IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire-fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and his current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court, "involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a  "joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others". "That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson," he said. The prosecution made clear that this was an "unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq." Nevertheless it is, according to them, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because he is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told they were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in his London home which suggested he already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic. The US-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It sparked years of violent conflict with different groups competing for power. British forces ended combat operations in 2009 and the US did so the following year. A total of 179 UK service personnel and nearly 4,500 US soldiers were killed during the conflict.	A British man worked on bombs planted in Iraq that claimed the life of a US soldier, a court has heard.
The mural, called Slave Labour, disappeared from a wall in Wood Green, north London, in February and appeared in a Miami sale. But it was removed from the lot after protests by Haringey Council. It is now up for auction in June in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group. A local councillor and the local Trades Union Congress have attacked the sale. The mural, which depicts a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the side of a Poundland store last May, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. A spokesman for the auctioneers Sincura said the mural "has been sensitively restored under a cloak of secrecy", and will go on show alongside pieces by Damien Hirst, Andy Warhol, Mario Testino and Russell Young. But Wood Green councillor Alan Strickland said: "This is a piece of art given to the community for public enjoyment, and people will find it galling that you can only view this work at an expensive champagne reception, when it belongs with the people of north London, not a private owner. "We saw the level of public anger last time, as the story went around the world, and I expect the same this time." And Keith Flett, secretary of the Haringey Trades Union Congress, said: "The Slave Labour Banksy belongs to the people of Haringey not to a wealthy private client." When the mural was up for auction in Miami, it was expected to fetch up to Â£450,000. There was suspicion it had been stolen when it disappeared but the Metropolitan Police said there were "no reports of any theft". Slave Labour will go on sale at the London Film Museum on 2 June.	A Banksy artwork which had been withdrawn from an auction in the US has been put up for sale again.
Leading by 37.2 seconds heading into the last stage, the Briton narrowly missed parked cars as he went off the road with under one kilometre left. However, he managed to quickly regroup as he finished 13.8 seconds ahead of world champion Sebastien Ogier. "I'm a lucky boy. I got caught out on a bump," said Citroen driver Meeke, 37. "Certainly one way to finish a rally." Hyundai driver Thierry Neuville finished third, 45.9 seconds behind Ford's Ogier. Leading by 30.9 seconds after bossing the first two days, Meeke won Sunday's penultimate stage to extend his lead to 37.2 seconds. That left him having to negotiate the final 21.94km stage around Derramadero. The county Tyrone man's late mishap left him only seventh fastest on the final stage but it proved enough to clinch a crucial victory following his disappointing performances in the opening two events of the season. After being strongly fancied to contend for this year's title, Meeke crashed out in Monte Carlo and could only finish 12th in Sweden after another mistake. Meeke, who competed in the championship for the first time in 2011, earned his first WRC win at Rally Argentina in 2015 and took further victories in Portugal and Finland last year. The Northern Irishman's gamble of opting for hard compound tyres on Saturday's nine stages despite the threat of rain was crucial to his victory as he extended his lead to take firm control of the event.	Northern Ireland's Kris Meeke survived a late scare at Rally Mexico to clinch his fourth win in a World Rally Championship event.
The summertime routes were due to end in late September but due to poor seat sales, the airline is stopping the service at the end of August. The airline said it had reallocated its planes to "routes with greater demand". It said it would offer a "full refund or alternative flights" to customers who were booked to fly in September "We apologise sincerely for the inconvenience caused," said an Aer Lingus statement.	Aer Lingus has apologised to customers after it cancelled all its September flights from Belfast to Majorca and from Belfast to Alicante, Spain.
Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a "home" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: "The players' allocation of 'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground. "The club is outraged by this development." The BBC contacted Fryston Warriors, who have declined to comment at this time.	Keighley want the Rugby Football League to consider amateur video footage when they review a brawl during the club's Challenge Cup tie against Fryston, which left a player with a broken jaw.
The ex-deputy prime minister, who is campaigning for Remain, said he feared Mr Johnson's "judgement is going". It marked a further escalation of a war of words between Tories over the EU. Mr Johnson earlier said it was a "bit too much" for David Cameron to say so-called IS would welcome an Out vote. And in response to Lord Heseltine's comments a spokesman for Mr Johnson said it was "the arguments that matter". In other EU developments ahead of the 23 June referendum: On Sunday Mr Johnson, the former London mayor, compared the EU's aims in creating a "single authority" in Europe with Napoleon's and Hitler's. He also suggested on Tuesday that David Cameron was "colluding" with business in the run-up to the 23 June referendum after a leaked letter from the boss of outsourcing firm Serco to the prime minister raised the question of business backing for the UK's EU membership as well as the further privatisation of the prison system. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Heseltine said the "strain" of the referendum campaign was "beginning to tell" on Mr Johnson and he had begun to make "preposterous obscene political remarks". "He is behaving now irresponsibly, recklessly and I fear that his judgement is going," he said. As Boris Johnson might say: "Cripes!" But that doesn't quite begin to cover it. This criticism will sting because even though Boris Johnson insists it is not the case, many of his Tory colleagues believe his calculation to join the Out campaign was entirely because he wants to be the next leader of his party. For Lord Heseltine, who of course had similar ambitions but was thwarted in the end, to suggest his decision and subsequent behaviour will in fact kill his chances will really hurt. Read more from Laura Asked if Mr Johnson could lead the Conservative Party one day, Lord Heseltine said: "I'd be very surprised." He added: "I think that every time he makes one of these extraordinary utterances, people in the Conservative Party will question whether he now has the judgement for that role." Asked about the historical parallels that Mr Johnson had drawn between the EU and the Nazis, Lord Heseltine - whose challenge helped trigger Margaret Thatcher's departure from Downing Street - said his generation had lived through the war and "knew what Hitler was about". "When he (Boris Johnson) starts invoking the memories of Hitler, that has crossed the bounds of domestic debate," he said. "It was about the most manic nationalist aggressive destruction on a scale unprecedented in human history. It was about the persecution of the Jews. A calculated decision to persecute the Jews on a massive scale - that was what he wanted to do. He believed in it. "The idea that a serious British politician can in any way invoke that memory, I find, frankly, I had better contain my language." Lord Heseltine also accused Mr Johnson of making a "near-racist remark" about US President Barack Obama after he referred in a newspaper article last month to Mr Obama's "part-Kenyan" ancestry and questioned whether this had influenced his attitude to the UK. In response, a spokesman for Mr Johnson said: "What matters here are the arguments. The British people want to hear debate - they aren't interested in personality politics or personal attacks. Let's get on and discuss the issues." Lord Heseltine is one of the most prominent pro-European voices in the Conservative Party, having argued for the UK to ditch the pound and adopt the euro. The Conservative peer rejected claims that both sides were equally guilty of making hyperbolic claims - such as David Cameron's recent suggestion that EU exit could threaten peace in Europe. It was not scaremongering, he suggested, to tell people what the UK's friends and partners around the world were saying.	Lord Heseltine has said he would be "very surprised" if Boris Johnson became prime minister after his "preposterous, obscene" remarks during the European Union referendum campaign.
Rose Morelli, 17, said it was "hugely distressing" to see the photo of Alex Elliot on the leaflet by the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia. Gay rights activist group Arcigay alerted her after she posted it online. Fratelli d'Italia tweeted an apology for its "improper" use of the photo. Ms Morelli took the photo as part of an art project. She and Alex Elliot chose the image after being moved by the case of US teenager Leelah Alcorn who took her own life in December. Leelah was born a boy but wanted to live her life as a girl. She is now taking legal action after her lawyer said Alex's image had been "misrepresented" and may have breached copyright issues. Mr Elliot, 17, said: "After the tragedy of Leelah Alcorn we wanted to get out the message, 'that can't happen again', and that what happened, was in my opinion, so horribly grotesquely moving." Ms Morelli said: "It struck me as hugely ironic at first but after I got over that initial sense of irony, it was hugely distressing. "The last thing we ever wanted to do was inflict harm on the members of the LGBT community. "To find out it was being used against them in such a malicious way was horrible." Italian law does not currently legislate against crimes motivated by the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victims. On its website, the Trentino branch of the Italian gay rights group, Arcigay, described Fratelli d'Italia's use of Ms Morelli's photo as "an insult". Ms Morelli's Italian lawyer, Alexander Schuster, said he planned to bring a civil action against Fratelli d'Italia and claim for damages. In a message on Twitter, Fratelli d'Italia said the use of the photo had been "improper". It said: "We did not want to offend the memory of Leelah." However, the party maintained that "it is right to campaign against gender teaching in school". Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) is currently opposing a civil partnership bill being debated by the Italian parliament. It is also known for its anti-immigration stance.	A student from Bristol is taking legal action after a picture of her friend was "misrepresented" by an Italian political party campaigning against transgender education in schools.
The council has launched an appeal to raise Â£150,000 for a bronze sculpture in the Barkers Pool area. Former steelworker Kathleen Roberts said: "It breaks my heart that we haven't been recognised and everyone else has been." The planned sculpture has been designed by artist Martin Jennings. Mrs Roberts said: "Times were tough in 1941, as a country we had our backs against the wall. We worked flat out for the war effort and we were just young girls. "I think the Sheffield industry could give more because they give so freely to others." Sheffield City Council put up a commemorative plaque to the women in 2011, while plans for the sculpture were already under way. Leader of Sheffield City Council, Julie Dore, said: "We all owe it to these amazing women to make the statue a reality."	A woman who "gave up her youth" to work in Sheffield's steel factories during World War II has said the city's "women of steel" need proper recognition.
Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed "Big Loz", said: "He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win." The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. "I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me," he said. "There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event." Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads "as many times as possible" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. "My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me," he said. "I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good."	Game of Thrones star "The Mountain" has been beaten to Europe's Strongest Man title by a man from Swindon.
We asked some of those taking part in the Online Influence Conference 2015  for their thoughts on what's going on - and what's next. You can follow too on Twitter at #Oi15 @OiConf John Watton, EMEA marketing director at Adobe Marketing Cloud who is returning to his home city for the conference; Amanda Neylon, head of digital at Macmillan Cancer Support, whose career has included Vauxhall Motors and the Met Police; Dr Jonathan Deacon, reader in marketing and entrepreneurship at University of South Wales, with a background in business, and Andrew Grill, global partner social business at IBM and previously CEO of Kred. Marketing on social media - is it about big bucks or can even the smallest business do it well? John Watton, EMEA marketing director at Adobe Marketing Cloud, @jwatton: "What I love right now is that the old barriers to marketing - money and technology - no longer exist. Marketing is accessible to everyone and it has become more about a company's willingness to do these things and their understanding how it can help to meet your business goals. Saying that, if you are able to invest in social media marketing you will be able to go far beyond just the likes and follows, and tie every piece of data to your bottom line." Amanda Neylon, head of digital at Macmillan Cancer Support, @amandaneylon: "I believe with the right insight driving the decisions anyone can do great social media marketing on any budget. Many of our social media marketing successes have been around amplifying amazing user-generated content rather than creating specific assets, because that is where the powerful stories are. For example, promoting  tips from The Source - our site designed to help us reach friends, colleagues, neighbours who may want to help someone with cancer but don't necessarily know what to do or say - has been a powerful way to reach new audiences." Dr Jonathan Deacon, reader in marketing and entrepreneurship at University of South Wales, @UniSouthWales: "No, like a lot of things in life the more cash you throw at something does not mean that it will get better. Social media is about three key things in my mind. Who you want to talk with, what you want to say and what you want them to do once you have said it. "Firstly, do you know your audience? Not just bland agglomerations of 'people' but an in-depth understanding of the individuals that make up an audience. What type of content do they read/share and why? How is it written? "Secondly, what do you want to say to this audience? What are you trying to achieve? Writing content is critical. Will the content that you share have meaning to the audience you want to communicate with and will they respond? "And thirdly, do you want someone to share your content, act upon it or perhaps just be amused by it? "If you take a closer look at these three things you will probably see that small firms are just as able as large firms to achieve a meaningful outcome with social media. I always think that small firms are better able as they have an intimate knowledge of the audience - they may even be part of the audience themselves." Andrew Grill, global partner social business at IBM, @AndrewGrill: "Just as 12 years or so ago when the internet first appeared, smaller companies that took advantage of this new tool could appear much larger than existing companies. "With social media, even the smallest company can have a global presence. I've seen companies of all sizes become successful with social media because they take the time to understand the language of social and engage authentically with their customers and fans. "My tip is don't treat social as a marketing channel, treat it as a conversation you would have with someone at the conference. You need to have something of value to exchange with your audience and not just interrupt a conversation. "I often challenge conference participants to go up to two other people at a networking break and see how long it takes to be invited into the conversation. If by listening closely you see where what you might say will add real value to the conversation, you will be welcomed in. If you just want to sell something you will be waved away. This is the same with social." People are already saying, 'ads are spoiling my social media experience' - are there lessons for brands/businesses to learn? JW: "A big learning for brands is that just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Even with all this new technology, not a lot has really changed and the basic principles of marketing remain - understand your customers, what they want and when they want it. Online marketing is all about the right time, right place and right message. If it doesn't deliver on this, it could have a negative impact on your brand." AM: "I think relevance is the key here. We as brands have access to so much data about our customers these days and it's important we use that when making marketing decisions. Personalised ads then have the capacity to become more useful additions to our customers' experience rather than intrusive." JD: "Yes, if the audience is dissatisfied with the content then you should listen and do something else. Social media is just that, social and therefore conversational, informal and individualistic. Advertising belongs in the age of mass market and mass communication - in the past." AG: "As I will explain during my Oi keynote [speech], social media is just like real life. My fear is that many companies see social as just 'another channel' and they try and push products on to people without understanding that they are interrupting existing conversations. We may never get away from 'ads' of some form. However, with social now being such a powerful tool, companies cannot simply reformat a marketing message for a social network. The lessons to learn are that companies that choose to engage with consumers and fans rather than advertise to them will be more successful in the longer term in my opinion." What's the best example of a good campaign on social media you've seen recently? JW: "Each year Adobe runs a digital marketing summit in the US and here in EMEA. While we work really hard to put together a great physical event, we make sure the experience starts long before and after the summit has taken place through our social channels. It's a great example of how a traditional marketing channel has been given a new lease of life through digital technology." JD: "For the very best execution of how to use social media take a look at Hiut Denim. They understand their audience, what they are trying to say and what they want people to do." AG: "Too many to choose from - but those that work across multiple platforms with a credible call to action get my attention." What's your favourite social media and how often do you use it? JW: "Twitter is the first thing I fire up when I get up in the morning. I probably use it every hour for news and sharing content I find interesting with my network." AM: "I still use Twitter a lot, mostly listening to keep up on what's new in digital (and the world) but I do try and tweet something useful at least once a day." JD: "LinkedIn - every day." AG: "Twitter! I wouldn't be at the Oi conference without Twitter - famously my "one tweet" in January 2011 lead me to working for IBM. I tweet whenever I have some downtime, in between meetings or walking home." When you eat, is your phone/tablet switched off? JW: "When I'm on my own, no. When I'm with my family, yes. It's a rule to never bring our phones to the table." AM: "Nope I tend to be always connected - though I don't take photos of my food." JD: "Mine is, but my wife keeps hers on, although she only answers once we have eaten." AG: "#SocialNeverSleeps" What's the last non-work related app you downloaded? JW: "This was the new Apple watch game 'Rules!' I'm expecting my new wearable to arrive anytime soon." AM: "My Apple watch has just been delivered so I'm spending quite a bit of time right now playing with all the apps I can have on it." JD: "A tilt-shift photo app which makes everything in your photos look miniature - very clever." AG: "WhatsApp - I'm one of the 700 million people sending 30 billion WhatsApps each day." What's the next big thing? JW: "One of the problems with social has long been proving its ROI (return on investment). We are now starting to think of social as a data-driven science, which is a great first step in helping to prove its value and starting to have meaningful conversations with other data-driven marketing teams." AM: "Data! I'm genuinely excited about data, or rather ways of using it. I think that we need to really develop the ways that we use all the data available to us to personalise customer experience across digital channels. Whether that's gathered from our social activity or newer areas like ibeacons or wearables, we can gather so much valuable data to make online experiences more impactful. Making connections between our online social interactions and all the offline data we're gathering about our lives will enable truly personalised, useful and interesting digital experiences." JD: "I see a lot of developments around 'EdTech' and I'm pretty sure that some of that will be successful when taken to market. I also think that the very smart and probably small firms will begin to better integrate social media with personalised communication. I can foresee firms mixing high-end social media with low-end hard copy, with great effect. For example, Twitter feeds backed up with occasional and highly personalised written letters, cards and the like - authoritative and authentic." AG: "Corporate Social Networks - we've only just scratched the surface of how companies can collaborate using social techniques and allow employees to be more productive, and more satisfied at work because they can share in the corporate wisdom of hundreds and even thousands of colleagues around the world. While this will be huge, it requires a massive cultural change, and will become the #NewWayToWork. This is something that clients are keeping me and my team at IBM very busy."	It's the "social" social media event of the year in Wales - hundreds of people involved in digital marketing are in Cardiff to hear insights from the likes of Google, Twitter, YouTube, and IBM.
Glamis Hall hosted a lunch club, including a three-course meal and activities, at its Wellingborough home. The hall was transferred to the control of community group Glamis Hall for All at the end of last year. Wellingborough Borough Council had planned to close it saying the hall was "no longer fit for purpose". Graham Campbell, whose father had been going to Glamis Hall for 20 years since he suffered a stroke, called the re-opening "just brilliant". He said: "The people we have spoken to are so pleased. That is what makes it all worthwhile." About 180 people use the hall's facilities regularly, but the borough council decided in June that the 40-year-old building was no longer fit for purpose and needed extensive refurbishment. It was deemed too expensive to run and had been supported using discretionary funding that was no longer available. The council decided to close Glamis Hall at the end of the year sparking a protests from users, their carers and community groups. Glamis Hall for All was set up in response and raised a 10,000-signature petition to save the centre. Freehold of the building was granted to the group after it presented a business plan to run it as a community amenity. The borough council also confirmed the group would be given a one-off capital grant of up to Â£250,000 to help repair and refurbish the building. Mr Campbell said the group would need plenty of volunteers and would have to apply for more funding. He said: "We can work on that. No-one thought we would get that far."	A day centre for older people which had been threatened with closure has opened for the first time under the control of the group which saved it.
It's clearly not the results. Beat Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday and they will have matched New Zealand's all-time tier one record for consecutive victories. It's not the way they finish games; under coach Eddie Jones, they have scored a cumulative 102 more points in the final quarter of matches than their opponents. It's what's been happening at the other end of the games that is raising eyebrows among critics and hopes among their opponents. Scoreless at home against Italy after 20 minutes, struggling to kick from hand, giving away set-piece penalties; 9-3 down to France, with a man in the sin bin; 10-0 down to Australia last autumn after 17 minutes, their opponents with 97% of the territory and 87% of the possession. It goes further back. Down against South Africa earlier in the autumn, six penalties conceded in the first 21 minutes. Two tries conceded in the first 20 minutes in the third of the summer Tests against the Wallabies, 10-0 down after 15 minutes of the first. You might say it doesn't matter. All those games were won. Against Wales in Cardiff England led 8-3 after the first quarter, with 74% of the possession. How could anyone complain when England have won their past 10 Six Nations matches, and are about to take on a team who haven't won in south-west London in 34 years? Jones, all those years of international coaching with four different nations whirring away in his brain, thinks otherwise. Part of that is about standards. This is a team he wants to win the next World Cup in 2019. Give the All Blacks a head-start and you are unlikely to catch them. Part of it is much more short-term: Scotland's revival in Vern Cotter's last year in charge is genuine. They are outsiders once again this weekend, but seldom in those 34 barren years have they travelled in such form. "Mate, if I knew I'd fix it," Jones said when asked this week if he had worked out what was going wrong in those opening exchanges. "And I haven't been able to fix it, so I don't know." "It's something we have been mentioning over the last few weeks," winger Jack Nowell told BBC Sport. "We've got ourselves out of jail a few times now - it is about a fast start, and putting our game on them first." Media playback is not supported on this device England's replacements - the finishers, as Jones likes to call them - have done that jail-breaking to perfection. According to Opta, the men off the bench have created more tries than those of any other nation (three scored, two assisted), made more carries, conceded the fewest turnovers and shipped only one penalty (Scotland's replacements have conceded six, France's seven). It's a wonderful asset for the coach to have. With a bench on Saturday that includes both Vunipola brothers, Jamie George, the returning Anthony Watson and the thundering Ben Te'o, it could be decisive once again this week. It does not mean the starters cannot be expected to match those same standards. Dig a hole often enough, and one day you might not be able to climb out of it. "It becomes a case of, are you riding your luck?" says Paul Grayson, the former England fly-half who is part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at Twickenham this weekend. "The Italy game was as bad an opening quarter as we've seen from an England team under Jones - and that was nothing to do with 'ruckgate' (when Italy's tactic of not committing to rucks befuddled England). They were just nowhere near it mentally. "Maybe that's a timely wake-up call, because when winning becomes supposedly routine, even if you get away with a couple, you've still got to find a way to motivate yourself. If England are not quite there mentally, they look ordinary, and at some point soon they will lose." "England need to start fast," former British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye told 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast this week. "They need to get the crowd on their side - three points, six, nine, score a try, shut out Scotland, and put a seed of doubt into their minds. "Scotland come down here with their fanfare and the bagpipes and their confidence, and everyone is aware of their threat, and if it's a close game you might just have the Twickenham crowd turning on their players a little bit." Jones has been in ornery form this week, irascible in his media conferences, hard-nosed with his players on the Pennyhill Park training pitches. "We're preparing to start well," he said irritably when announcing his selection. "We're not preparing not to start well. "It's an 80-minute game. We've got to be ahead at the 80-minute mark, and that's what we're aiming to be against Scotland. "It's like starting a 100m race. You can be ahead at the 10m mark, but you've got to be ahead at the 100m mark." Jones, a self-confessed cricket nut, might enjoy another analogy: a pair of opening batsmen playing and missing on the first morning of a Test match, the opposition fast bowler fired up and the new ball seaming and bouncing past the outside edge. What does it matter if they are 80-3 at lunch if by the close they have put on 300 for the loss of only one more wicket? "Ian McGeechan, when he was coaching Northampton and telling us how he wanted us to play, brought up the example of Wigan's very successful rugby league team," remembers Grayson. "Every team that played Wigan wanted to beat them. They would be totally up for it, and they would go toe-to-toe with them. They got to half-time, and it would be 10-8, or 6-6, or they would only be four points down. "Then they would get into the second half, and as that effort left them tired and weakened, they would roll over and Wigan would score 40 points. "I used to think, what does a game look like after 20 minutes? If I can get some points on the board, great; if they've thrown a few shots and we've had to defend for a while and they haven't got much out of it, no problem, we'll see you in the last 10 minutes of the first half and the last 15 minutes of the contest. "The opposition are always going to be at their most obstinate and most up for it in that period. Yet, barring the Wales game, England haven't had too much flow in attack in the early part of their games. It's always difficult, but if you're the best side in the world, you do it. The All Blacks always manage to come out of the blocks." Such has been the impact of England's replacements that the impression is that Jones has enviable strength in depth. He does - at prop and hooker, at scrum-half, on the wings. With first-choice lock George Kruis out injured and his preferred partner Maro Itoje shifted to six, stand-in second rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes have arguably been England's most effective players. But it is not true throughout the team. England's Test cricket team often find themselves early wickets down because they have struggled to replace Andrew Strauss alongside Alastair Cook. They can struggle on turning pitches because no-one who has come into the team has been able to match the impact of world-class spinner Graeme Swann. "Nathan Hughes looks like the Billy Vunipola of three years ago," says Grayson. "Likely to last 50 minutes or do 30 minutes off the bench, do two or three good things but also disappear for a while. "And that makes a massive difference. Take Lawrence Dallaglio out of England's World Cup-winning team and put in another number eight, and what do they look like? They're just not quite as big or powerful or dominant or vocal. "When Dallaglio wasn't playing, England weren't quite the same. And I think that Vunipola is at that point. He's an 80-minute player heading to world class. And they just haven't got that otherwise. "Billy has been out and with Chris Robshaw being out, that's two-thirds of your first-choice back row. That's a huge loss to England, because they don't have that many great back-row players."	It might sound a curiously mealy-mouthed thing to say about a team that have won their past 17 matches and sit atop the Six Nations table with consecutive Grand Slams a genuine possibility, but England's rugby team might have a problem.
Kjell Lindgren played Amazing Grace on the pipes after recording a message about research scientist Victor Hurst, who was involved in astronaut training. It is thought to be the first time that bagpipes have been played in space. They were made for Mr Lindgren by McCallum Bagpipes at the company's factory in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. Kenny Macleod, who works at McCallum Bagpipes, told BBC Scotland the 42-year-old astronaut had got in touch two years ago to say he was going to the space station and wanted to play the pipes while he was there. "He wondered if it was feasible to play bagpipes," he said. "They're made of plastic - they're just easier to keep clean and to make sure they're not contaminated. They're also lighter." In the video, Mr Lindgren is seen to give the pipes a punch before he starts playing. Mr Macleod said it was normal for pipers to massage the bag to get the air flowing, "but not quite as vigorously as that". "The thing about bagpipes is that they're very difficult to play at high altitude because the air is that bit thinner. They're quite hard to blow so he's done well," he added. There are six astronauts currently in space on the 45th expedition to the International Space Centre. In a video recorded in the last few days, Mr Lindgren said all of them had come into contact with Dr Hurst during their training and were "shocked and saddened" to hear about his death. Dr Hurst worked for US engineering company Wyle Science as a research scientist and instructor. He died suddenly in October, aged 48. Nasa flight engineer Mr Lindgren said: "He always had a quick smile, a kind word. I don't know if anyone was more enthusiastic and professional about being involved in human space flight."	A US astronaut has played a set of Scottish-made bagpipes on the International Space Station to pay tribute to a colleague who died.
Joseph Fox photographed the mudlarkers who comb the shore of London's River Thames. Originally a term for the city's poor who scraped a meagre living by scavenging in the river's mud, it has been adopted by a new breed of treasure hunters, often armed with metal detectors. These men and women show off their favourite finds, and discuss the joys of mudlarking. Dave Hiddleston, Limehouse Long fascinated by history and collecting, Dave first discovered mudlarking while he was working on Cannon Street and saw people on the foreshore in wellington boots. His favourite find is an English community cloth seal, which he believes was used to stamp cloth bags coming through London in about 1618.   It was inside a lump of burnt cinder. Dave said: "I am always encouraging others to go mudlarking. It is a great escape from the humdrum of modern life, and interesting doing research on your finds. "Plus you get to meet some really interesting like-minded people." Edward Sandling, Vauxhall Ted discovered mudlarking by chance. "I was walking along South Bank," he said, "and I just hopped over a gate and came down to the foreshore. You get a sense of quietude and the perspectives on the city are so different, just by that small change of level." He then noticed the objects at his feet, such as this pipe stem shaped like a horse's hoof. He said: "I have finds that are older and perhaps more beautiful, but this is the one that set it all off. "It's absolutely beautiful. To hold it and know that someone else was smoking it 150 to 200 years ago is amazing." Ted believes that London's beauty lies in the fact that it hasn't all been embanked, and its tides allow these things to be found on the beaches: "It churns up discoveries every day. Every tide there are new things to be found." The one item he is holding out for is a Bartmann jug, decorated stoneware from Germany that was used to transport food, drink and goods. For Ted, "they inspire thoughts of darkly forested mountains". Andrea Smith, Rotherhithe Although she began only in October last year, Andrea makes time to go to the shore up to six times a week. She uses a metal detector, alongside her eyes and a trowel, to find shards of pottery such as this, painted with a willow pattern. Andrea said: "It does not happen often that a shard contains both doves. "I have found great joy, serenity and peace with my soulmate and best friend, my husband Iain.  This shard represents this to me." Sara Cannizzaro, Vauxhall It's the unexpectedness of mudlarking that drew Sara to it, in contrast to the routine of London life. "I feel the excitement when I'm walking along the bank," she said. "It's a way of making order out of chaos." Sara has managed to find a piece of Bartmann jug, which - from the splashes of cobalt blue glaze - she has dated to 1600-20, made in Frechen. She said: "The face that was impressed on the neck of these jugs is a prized find from all mudlarkers - everyone wants to find one!" Mark Smalley, Rotherhithe Mark picks the shore in Rotherhithe because of the area's history as the place where pilgrims sailed to America, making him believe it is easier to find trader tokens and hammered coins. He uses a metal detector, explaining: "You're looking for the black areas where there's a lot of erosion - that's hopefully where your history will be. The hard pack underneath holds the history." His favourite find is a potted ham jar lid, which despite being only Victorian, is very rare as it is intact. The peacefulness of mudlarking is what appeals to Mark. "The whole world is buzzing above you and you're just out of it completely," he said. "You're just in your own world."	All photographs taken by Joseph Fox.
Apple was sued in 2014 for allegedly using a technology developed by a professor and his students in its iPhone chips without the University of Wisconsin-Madison's permission. Apple was ordered to pay about $234m (Â£179m) when it lost the patent case. That sum has now been more than doubled because it continued to use the tech. The judge said that additional damages and interest brought the sum owed to $506m. However, Apple still hopes to overthrow the fine by appealing against the original jury verdict. The penalty is still less than the $862m the university had originally sought in damages. That is because Apple was found not to have deliberately infringed the university's microchip technology. The patent in question outlined a way to boost computing performance by predicting how processors are about to be used. The original case covered Apple's use of the invention in its A7, A8 and A8X processors, which are found in devices including the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air 2. Apple did not re-engineer the chips after losing the dispute in 2015 nor pull the relevant products from sale, and thus became liable for the additional payout. The university is also seeking further compensation for Apple's continued infringement of the patent in its A9 and A9X chips, which power its iPhone 6S and iPad Pro models. However, the follow-up legal action has been put on hold until Apple's appeal has been considered.	A US judge has ordered Apple to pay more than half a billion dollars to a university after the tech firm failed to abide by an earlier court ruling.
The ex-Lib Dem MP and ex-wife Vicky Pryce were both jailed after she took his speeding points in 2003. Some 360 former MPs were granted passes for the Parliamentary estate, according to the Press Association's FOI request. Labour MP John Mann said Huhne should not have been given the pass. Mr Mann said: "I do not think someone who has committed a criminal offence that has meant they went to prison should get privileged access to the Houses of Parliament. "Let them queue with the general public if they want to get in." Huhne and Pryce both served two months of an eight-month sentence. Huhne had quit the Cabinet and stood down as Eastleigh MP after pleading guilty. Speaking after his release, he said prison had been "a humbling and sobering experience". Also on the passholders list was ex-Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, and Derek Conway, who had the Conservative whip withdrawn and then stepped down as an MP after his employment of his son was heavily criticised.	Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne - who was jailed for perverting the course of justice in 2013 - has been granted a Commons pass, a Freedom of Information Act request has revealed.
Kleptomaniac Theo, from Ipswich, first hit the headlines in 2013 for stealing Christmas decorations. Recently he has been stealing toy food, including a pineapple and an aubergine. "We are deeply ashamed of our cat, especially as he had convinced us that he had changed his criminal ways," his owner wrote to neighbours. Rachael Drouet created a leaflet for her neighbours in a bid to reunite the stolen items with their rightful owners. "This year has been relatively quiet, save for some Bettaware catalogues and the odd flat balloon," the leaflet read. "Until a few days ago when he started bring home toy food. "So far we have cheese, a green pepper, fish, a pineapple, an aubergine, and a felt basket to put them all in." Theo, a five-year-old Siamese cross, also managed to bring home a child's body warmer. Earlier this year, he stole a catalogue from a house down the street owned by a policeman, which Ms Drouet said "wasn't ideal". Among the items stolen in the last couple of years are muslin cloths, fluffy pens, a USB phone charger cable and a child's piece of art. Theo also took to stealing Christmas decorations from neighbours' trees. Ms Drouet said this year she managed to reunite items from Theo's haul with their rightful owners before too long. "I wrote the flyers and then luckily managed to find out who all the things belonged to," Ms Drouet said. "You get tired of knocking on neighbours' doors and saying 'me again'".	A pet cat with a track record for stealing has slipped back into his criminal ways despite convincing his owner he was a reformed character.
Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are "urgently" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to "open their hearts and homes" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. "Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life," she said. "I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. "They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. "They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman." The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: "As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. "We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. "In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. "A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members." Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. "We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living."	Teenagers in foster care in Scotland are being moved too often, according to a campaign group.
Matthew Daley, 35, killed Donald Lock, on the A24 in Findon, near Worthing, last July after the 79-year-old ran into the back of his vehicle. He was convicted of manslaughter after he admitted stabbing Mr Lock to death, claiming diminished responsibility. Daley was told he would initially serve his time in a secure mental hospital. Lewes Crown Court heard Daley was a paranoid schizophrenic whose mother, Lynda, had pleaded with mental health experts to have him sectioned. She told the court the day she heard Mr Lock had been killed was "the day that all your nightmares came true". Daley was charged with murder, but never denied killing Mr Lock on 16 July last year. Daley will be held in Hellingly medium-secure psychiatric hospital in East Sussex under the Mental Health Act. Should his health improve, he will then be transferred to prison. Mr Justice Singh said the killing was a "violent, unprovoked attack" in front of members of the public, aggravated partly by Mr Lock's age and the use of a weapon. "It's clear from the verdict that the defendant's responsibility for the homicide was substantially impaired," he said. "It does not follow that it was completely extinguished." Prior to the start of the trial, Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised for not doing more. It has since announced an independent review into 10 killings involving patients known to the Trust, including the case of Matthew Daley. Mr Lock's son Andrew said the sentencing of Daley did not did not remove from the family's memories the horror of what happened. "However, at least we can move on knowing that the public are properly protected from a man who, whilst badly treated by the NHS by a catalogue of failures, is a danger to the public if not properly supervised and medicated," he said. "It is important to note Mr Justice Singh's observation this was not a public inquiry into the failings of the NHS. "But it is now up to the NHS that the systematic arrogance that exists in the medical world changes for good and that they wake up to the fact that we all deserve to be listened to."	A man who stabbed a retired solicitor 39 times after a crash between their cars has been given life and will serve at least 10 years.
Starting under the Redheugh Bridge and finishing past the Millennium Bridge, the 1500m race first began in 1997 but stopped in 2010 due to funding issues. The competition sees rowers from Durham University go head-to-head with those from Newcastle University. Tim Clarke, president of Newcastle University Boat Club, said he was "very hungry" for victory on the River Tyne. Durham captain James Styles said it was always good to have a "one-on-one" with their rivals.	The Boat Race of the North is returning to the Newcastle-Gateshead Quayside following a five-year absence.
Last year serious floods hit north and mid Wales, and one woman died. Environment Minister John Griffiths announced that the Welsh government plans to spend £47m in 2013/14 on schemes to protect 1,000 homes. However, that is likely to be less than the amount spent on flood defences and dealing with coastal erosion in the previous two years. "We know our climate is changing and that as a result we are set to see, and have already seen, an increase in rainfall and storms," Mr Griffiths said. By working together and sharing knowledge "we can vastly improve our resilience to flooding in Wales", he said. Outlining his plans, Mr Griffiths said: "Continued investment in flood and coastal erosion risk management is a vital part of our work to manage flood risk, and in spite of a reduction in our overall budget from the UK government the Welsh government has maintained its level of investment in this area. "In 2013/14 I am investing £47m in flood and coastal erosion risk management which will pay for major flood defence schemes in some of our most vulnerable communities including Swansea vale, Fairbourne, Corwen and Coldbrook, Barry. This would protect 1,000 homes and businesses currently at risk of flooding. Although the Welsh government's "baseline" spending on flood defences is growing slightly, other sources of funding have been cut. The £47.2m earmarked for the next financial year compares to £52.7m this year and £51.9m the previous year. In the past extra funding has become available during the year, meaning the amount that is eventually spent could rise if the same happens again. Mr Griffiths added: "It is so important that we effectively target our funding for flood defence.. "That is why my national strategy includes a commitment to developing a national funding policy as well as a method for prioritising investment. "A group has been set up to progress this work and once completed the national programme of investment will enable areas of Wales to be ranked according to risk from all sources of flooding and coastal erosion." Last year was a disastrous one for flooding in Wales. In June, a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours in Ceredigion, hitting Aberystwyth and surrounding villages, trapping people in their homes and flooding caravan parks. In November, a 91-year-old woman died and more than 1,000 people had to leave their homes after the River Elwy burst its banks in St Asaph, Denbighshire. In December, heavy flooding hit the Vale of Glamorgan while homes in Ystalyfera in the Swansea Valley were evacuated after landslips brought thousands of tonnes of soil down onto a road. Monday's summit in Cardiff unites the Welsh government, local authorities, the Met Office, Environment Agency Wales, Welsh Water, and other organisations. It coincides with climate change campaign Climate Week. Emyr Roberts of Natural Resources Wales, a new agency that will take over responsibility for Environment Agency Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission next month, said he thought Wales had the right approach to flooding in the past. "Obviously in many areas the answer is to raise flood defences, but increasingly we're putting more emphasis on communities - raising awareness about what the flooding risks are and what individuals can do about it," he said. "Obviously, we're working very closely with the emergency services, but I think the summit... will be looking at longer term issues and ways in which we might use the natural environment to alleviate the problems of flooding." Local Government Minister Carl Sargeant said the role of the local community was also important in tackling the challenges caused by severe weather. Communities which develop a flood plan can act more quickly and effectively when flooding happens. "It is vital that services comes together and work hard to save lives, protect property and help communities recover," said Mr Sargeant. "This was demonstrated in serious flood incidents last year and we owe our emergency services a debt of gratitude for their professionalism, commitment and dedication."	A summit is considering how Wales can respond to the growing threat posed by flooding.
Costco store manager Roger Cooper, 41, and ex-soldier David Cooper, 39, both deny killing Sameena Imam, 34. Her body was found buried at an allotment in Leicester in January after allegedly been killed with chloroform. Ms Imam had been having a two-year affair with Roger Cooper and issued him with an ultimatum to leave his partner. Roger Cooper, of Coventry, denies murdering his colleague after driving her from Coventry to Leicester on December 24, claiming he dropped her off at a supermarket following an argument. His brother, of Leicester, has admitted burying Ms Imam's body but denies doing anything to cause her death. The prosecution claim Roger Cooper wanted Ms Imam out of his life as he conducted three relationships, and enlisted the help of his brother to "plan and execute" the alleged murder. A trial at Birmingham Crown Court, which began in August, was told by a toxicologist that several metallic elements were found in the body of Ms Imam. She had worked at Costco outlets in Cardiff, Coventry, Southampton and Bristol.	A jury trying two brothers accused of murdering a cash-and-carry manager from Cardiff has retired to consider its verdicts at Birmingham Crown Court.
Winger Young won the last of his 30 caps against Ukraine in September 2013. But his form under Van Gaal has led to suggestions England coach Roy Hodgson might end that exile when he names his squad on 19 March for the games against Lithuania and Italy. "The manager has been fantastic," said Young. "He gives you the confidence to play and confidence helps massively." He added:  "I can only repay him with my performances on the pitch. That is what I have shown this season." Young has been used as a full-back and at wing-back this season. Van Gaal picked the 29-year-old former Watford and Aston Villa player in a more orthodox wide position in the 3-0 win over Tottenham. Hodgson was at Old Trafford to watch one of United's best performances of the season - and a player who was an ever present at Euro 2012. "Fingers crossed I can get myself back into the England team," said Young, speaking at a bwin event. "I have always said I want to represent my country. It is an honour to play for England and hopefully I have done enough to get myself back into the squad. "But I am concentrating on events at my club and we will just have to wait and see."	Ashley Young says Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has helped revive his hopes of an England recall.
Talk in Europe today moved swiftly from Brexit to possible Frexit (France voting to leave the EU), Swexit (that's Sweden) and more. Leaders of Europe's increasingly influential Eurosceptic parties queued up today to crow over the British vote and make political capital out of it. "It's now a reality for everyone. It is possible to leave the EU," proclaimed Marine Le Pen of France's National Front (FN), a leading contender in next year's presidential election. The mood in Brussels is resentful and despondent, while governments across Europe are scared. They feel the heat from angry electorates who share many of the criticisms of the EU highlighted during the UK's referendum campaign. That's why you've been hearing the words "EU" and "reform" of late from the nervous mouths of some you'd least expect, such as Germany's Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk, the Brussels-based President of the European Council. Because they're so worried, the EU is preparing to get tough with Britain over the terms and timing of a new trade relationship. This is not about punishment - well, not much. It's more a desire for the process to be painful to put others off exiting, while Europe's leadership tries to re-group and, perhaps, reform. But there are divisions here too that threaten to drive the EU even further apart. France rather relishes the idea of making an example of Britain. And Paris will flex its muscles far more now that the UK has voted itself out of having a voice at the EU table. But the countries of Central and Eastern Europe aren't keen to alienate the UK. They rely on Britain to support them in maintaining tough sanctions against Russia. And Poland in particular also worries about its 800,000 citizens living in the UK. Germany is somewhere inbetween. Mrs Merkel urged fellow EU leaders not to rush to conclusions about the Brexit vote as that "would only divide Europe more". She is a devoted European but she doesn't relish the idea of a resurgent France. She'll miss the UK's competitive approach to the single market, its loathing of EU protectionism and the British sense of humour she's said to be so fond of. Of course, until the UK formally notifies EU leaders of the intent to leave (which, to their irritation, could take months) everything stays the same. In theory. But next week's summit of EU leaders will be a very awkward one for David Cameron. Nothing has changed on paper yet in Brussels. But the EU has been turned upside down.	In all the years I've covered European politics, I've never seen this continent so Eurosceptic or the future of the European Union so uncertain.
The politics is also apparent in the newspaper sales figures for the first half of the year. Out this week, they show the average decline at more than 10% since the first half of last year, continuing the industry's painful downward trajectory. Scotland on Sunday saw print sales fall more than 20%. It now has an average weekly sale of less than 25,000. It doesn't have its own staff any more, relying on a journalism pool shared with its stablemate, The Scotsman. "SoS" is now being beaten by the only weekly "regional" paper to register a rise in print sales, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sunday Herald looked to be on its last legs, but found a niche by backing the independence cause. Approving "Yes" campaigners backed it, with a big lift in the back half of last year, from which it's fallen back, but still retained an average 29,000 weekly sales. Its publisher, Newsquest, also saw a gap in the daily market for pro-independence readers. Although the figures aren't audited, we're told they're selling nearly 17,000 a day. These are small numbers when set alongside the total sale of newspapers. The constitutional debate may have polarised opinion and changed some buying behaviour, but it can be overstated. The decline of sales in Scotland has recently been steeper than those for the rest of the UK, but the trends are similar. Meanwhile, publishers point out there's a rise in online readership. But that's not making them enough money to sustain their cost bases. In the case of the Scotsman's figures, daily online readers are down 33% since a busy referendum period. Those news publishers are competing with broadcasters for online readers. We've just got half year figures for STV which show  it aiming to achieve its turnaround by the end of next year. A high priority is the desire to find a new earner from making drama series, as royalties from Taggart re-runs fade to black. It's finding the transition and investing in new services can be expensive, with an Â£800,000 half-year loss on its two city stations, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh. They're being watched by 900,000 people in the average month which, we're told, is 30% of the potential audience. The Glasgow channel is being aimed at break-even by the end of this year. STV also lost a wad of cash by having to bail out Mirriad, a digital advertising firm in which it invested. It may have failed to raise the finance needed without the bail-out, but it's clever stuff, "advertising to the skip generation", with personalised product placement embedded in video content. For instance, a music video might have a street scene, in which a background billboard has ads which differ, depending on who is viewing. Advertising is not part of the BBC debate. Not yet anyway. But as the future of the licence fee is discussed, they are a sort of subliminal presence on the background billboards. A project, financed by the BBC and published this week, sought to find out how small groups of people responded to living without the corporation's TV, radio and online content for a few days. It concluded the group who resented having to pay the annual Â£145.50 missed it more than they expected, and some were despairing at the impact of adverts on their viewing of commercial channels. Commissioning that research is part of the BBC's fight for its very existence, at least if you believe some of the interpretation of the government's green paper on how the next 10-year charter is going to change things. The charter is due to start from the end of next year. We're half way through the consultation on that, and so far the UK government appears to have retreated from the early briefings to delighted print rivals that Auntie might as well be put in a retirement home, her funding clipped, with a remit to leave popular entertainment to the commercial market-place. Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has been in Edinburgh for its International TV Festival this week, making reassuringly supportive comments about the BBC. He'll be aware that it has a lot of fans mobilised to defend it, including some formidable cultural celebrities. Some, including Armando Ianucci and Sue Perkins, used the Festival platform to sound off. The context of the debate on the BBC's future in Scotland is, of course, rather different. The broadcaster's fans have not rushed forward to argue the case for it. The independence referendum seems to have left a bruised legacy of reluctance to engage. It also left a legacy of a starkly changed political landscape, to which the BBC has to respond, even if Mr Whittingdale's green paper didn't make much of it. The document only noted the Smith Commission's agreement that the BBC should be answerable to Holyrood on a similar basis to its accountability at Westminster (note that it's accountable for its management and use of resources, rather than its output and journalism). On the pro-independence side, there's some tacit awareness that the broadcasting section was hardly the most compelling part of the Scottish government white paper. It proposed a new Scottish broadcaster while somehow ensuring that all the popular BBC stuff was retained. Less tacit are vociferous critics of the BBC's political coverage, including pro-independence websites and bloggers, some threatening mass non-payment of the licence fee. Having mobilised protests outside the BBC last year, that element continues to be fired up by Alex Salmond, in his newspaper column and promoting his book, with ever stronger condemnations of the BBC's referendum coverage. The body set up to represent viewers, listeners and readers, the Audience Council of Scotland, took 10 months to produce a report that reflected on the referendum. When it did, it was both supportive and quite challenging of the corporation's coverage. It said online was of "exceptional quality" (including something called "expert economic analysis" - though if there was, I missed it). But it also said coverage failed to respond to the change in campaigning style, as grass roots and social media played such a significant role. The Council pointed to "an opportunity to review issues in the light of experience in the referendum", though it stopped short of explicitly calling for one. So that was the complex background to Alex Salmond's successor, previously with little to say on the subject, setting out her thoughts on broadcasting, and the BBC in particular, with a speech at the TV festival. Nicola Sturgeon said she approached the subject with trepidation. Her speech was very carefully worded. It's hard to believe this was anything like the speech Alex Salmond would have delivered. Criticism of the BBC's campaign coverage last year was measured. The first minister said she saw no "institutional bias", and praised at least some BBC Scotland journalism. She went on to argue that there was a failure to strike the right balance between holding independence plans up to scrutiny on a parallel basis with the prospects for remaining within the UK. "The status quo and the consequences of voting 'No' were not really analysed at all," she claimed, voicing the irritation of those who feel there wasn't a level playing field. And she cited the Audience Council in support of her view that London-based journalists had failed to catch the mood of Scots audiences. Their broad brush reports jarred, it was argued, with the detailed scrutiny of issues that had long been debated at every level of Scottish society. BBC management responded to her speech with a statement beginning: "We believe our coverage of the referendum was rigorously impartial and in line with our guidelines on fairness and impartiality". The Sturgeon speech then turned its focus on the future. For her followers, it's worth noting a change of direction - no longer talk of a Scottish Broadcasting Service splitting from the BBC, but a federal structure. The design appears to allow for either devolution or independence. That way, it helps to disarm Ms Sturgeon's constitutional opponents in their claims that an independent Scotland would be deprived of Eastenders, Strictly Come Dancing and Sir David Attenborough. The governance requires a Scottish board of overseers, she said, while the output requires a Scottish TV channel (in addition to BBC Alba in Gaelic), and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland. Her most forthright criticism was of the BBC's past attempts to avoid becoming a leader of constitutional change by refusing the pressure to split its flagship network news coverage, at 6 and 10 o'clock, for a different perspective from Scotland for Scots. "The criticism that should be levied at the BBC is not that it has tried to lead constitutional change," said the first minister. "It is that it has totally failed to follow it. "The UK has changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters are still catching up with its consequences. And although that poses questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue is maybe most acute with the BBC." The message was aimed at Mr Whittingdale to some extent, but more so at the BBC. So how will it respond? Last month, the official answer to concerns about a lack of trust was to point to large audiences for the flagship news programme, Reporting Scotland. And even last month, these were "early days" for a debate about changes to governance. Not any longer. Not with a BBC Trust survey finding that only 48% of Scots think that the corporation reflects their lives. That's lower than other parts of the UK. That BBC spokesman's reaction to the first minister's speech continued: "We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in charter review. "The BBC's funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC. "We will have to balance our investment on pan-UK services with dedicated services in the Nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). We will aim to protect spending in the Nations so that content investment is cut less than in other parts of the BBC." Expect more on that from the Beeb next month. With the first minister's speech, an important debate on the future of the media in Scotland has only (at last) just begun.	Scotland's media landscape is being bulldozed - transformed by digital technology, burgeoning choice, and quite a bit of politics - particularly as the future of the BBC is now in play.
The former Nova Centre in Prestatyn will be given a new gym, cafe and pool-side changing rooms as part of the Â£4.2m revamp. Three promenade-side retail units and a soft play facility will also be built. The centre shut last February after the trust running it had its funding pulled by Denbighshire council. The work, starting on Monday, is expected to be finished by July.	A multi-million pound refurbishment of a Denbighshire leisure centre which was closed because of council cutbacks is due to start.
Jill Campbell has run the Isis Boutique in Malvern, Worcestershire, for seven years. But she said people have been linking the store to Islamic State, which has killed hostages including British aid agency worker David Haines. She said some comments have been "quite upsetting". Some "very unpleasant" posts have also been made on social media about the shop, which is named after the river in Ms Campbell's home city, Oxford. "I'm now in the position of thinking do I change the name or do I stick it out?" she said. "It's an unsettling time." Ms Campbell plans to open a second boutique elsewhere in the country, but said she would "probably not" use the Isis name. "I have absolutely no sympathy with these monsters in Syria and it is for very innocent reasons that we chose the name," she said.	A woman says she is considering rebranding her business because it shares its name with a Middle East extremist group.
The Microscope and its Revelations, by Dr William B Carpenter, was borrowed by former pupil Professor Arthur Boycott, who attended Hereford Cathedral School between 1886 and 1894. It was discovered by his granddaughter Alice Gillett. The school has promised to waive any fines - which based on the rate at Hereford Library of 17p a day, would have amounted to a staggering Â£7,446. See more stories from Herefordshire and Worcestershire here Mrs Gillett discovered the book while she was sorting through a collection of 6,000 books following the death of her husband earlier this year. On discovering the HCS library stamp inside the book, Mrs Gillett, who lives near Taunton, decided to return it. "I can't imagine how the school has managed without it," she said. The book would have been of good use to young Boycott as he eventually graduated with first class honours in Natural Science and became a distinguished naturalist and pathologist.	An overdue school library book has finally been returned - 120 years late.
Norah Boyle, 85, suffered a head injury as Sabrina Duncan and Benter Ouma put her to bed at The Green Nursing Home in Kings Norton. She died 23 days later. The workers delayed calling 999 and pretended Mrs Boyle knocked her head on the head board. They must do 160 hours' unpaid work and pay Â£500 court costs each. The pair were not prosecuted for being responsible for the fall, but for being "grossly negligent in their response". Mrs Boyle died in hospital after developing pneumonia. In sentencing, judge Mark Wall said it was impossible to say whether reporting the incident any earlier would have made any difference to Mrs Boyle's eventual death. Her daughter, Ellen Boyle, said: "I'm appalled that that's what they got for what happened to my mum. "I'm appalled that my mother's life is only worth 12 months of a community order." Speaking after the court hearing Det Sgt Victoria Lee said the pair had delayed calling an ambulance while they came up with a cover story. "While [Duncan and Ouma] plotted, Mrs Boyle laid in bed with a serious head injury, her head bleeding onto the pillow," she said. "Most of us have relatives who are frail, disabled or vulnerableâ€¦ we expect them to be cared for professionally and compassionately." Duncan, 40, of Shartlands Close, Cotteridge, and Ouma, 31, of Summerfield Crescent, Edgbaston, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court to neglect and ill-treatment.	Two care workers who admitted neglect after a pensioner fell from a hoist at a Birmingham care home have been sentenced to 12-month community orders.
Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint reportedly includes a 37% spending cut for the State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID). He will set out to convince Congress of his proposal in his first address to a joint session on Tuesday night. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said his plan is "dead on arrival". "It's not going to happen. It would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table then you're never going to win the war," Senator Graham said. Soft power is an American term that refers to diplomatic tools such as foreign aid and humanitarian relief. "What's most disturbing about the cut to the State Department's budget is it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war," Senator Graham continued. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said Mr Trump's reported deep cuts to the State Department would "probably not" pass Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending. To the White House, foreign aid might seem like an easy target for cuts, but those who protect the country think otherwise. In their letter to lawmakers more than 120 former military officers quoted the Defence Secretary James Mattis from his days as a field commander: "If you don't fully fund the State Department then I need to buy more ammunition." They argued that strengthening diplomacy and development were critical to preventing conflict. International assistance in the State Department budget does more than respond to humanitarian needs, it also supports policy goals. For example, it supplements the military fight against the so-called Islamic State through programmes to disrupt the group's financing and recruitment, and to stabilise communities where IS has been driven out. There's money to address the underlying causes of migration from Central America, and to strengthen allies such as Afghanistan and Ukraine. The former Secretary of State John Kerry was known to make a strong case for increasing the department's financing, (which at $50bn makes up just 1% of the entire budget). The new Secretary Rex Tillerson will have to fight simply to keep what he has, or the State Department will be marginalised in an administration focused on the military. The president released a budget proposal on Monday calling for a $54bn (Â£43bn) boost to military spending. This would be paid for, according to the plan, by gutting other programmes including foreign aid and the environmental agency. The White House also plans to reduce spending for the State Department and USAID,  say US media reports, which together received an estimated $50.1bn during the current fiscal year, or a little more than 1% of the total federal budget. More than 120 retired generals have signed a letter urging Congress not to cut funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. The letter said: "As you and your colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018, we write as retired three and four star flag and general officers from all branches of the armed services to share our strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe." Development assistance would probably be hardest hit while staff reductions would see fewer security contractors at diplomatic missions abroad, the AP reported, citing officials familiar with the proposal. The Office of Management and Budget has not yet said where overall reductions would occur. The Republican pushback over Mr Trump's reported plan comes as the president is set to deliver his first major speech to Congress since taking office. An address to Congress is a different kind of presidential speech. Will the American public see a different Donald Trump? If history is any guide, that seems unlikely. Every time there has been talk of a pivot or shift of focus for candidate Trump, or president-elect Trump, or President Trump, the end result has been the same Donald Trump as always - blustering and belligerent, unvarnished and unapologetic. Mr Trump would be well-served to take a different tack tonight, however. While he's spent his first month in office in a blizzard of activity, issuing executive orders and squelching controversies, there's been little progress with his agenda in Congress. Top-line items like tax cuts and healthcare reform will be heavy legislative lifts with a baulky conservative caucus in the House and a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, requiring presidential leadership of a kind not yet demonstrated by Mr Trump. Recent opinion polls have shown the president's standing with the public improving after a dismal first few weeks, but any progress can quickly evaporate if his "man of action" bravado runs headfirst into congressional obstinance. Tuesday night's speech is the president's first major opportunity to avoid that outcome. He is expected to set out in greater detail his plans to cut spending and boost the economy as well as offer an "optimistic vision" about the "renewal of the American spirit", a senior White House official told the BBC. At least one Democrat has said he would refuse to shake Mr Trump's hand before the speech, bucking a longstanding bipartisan tradition in presidential first addresses to Congress. Representative Eliot Engel, a top New York Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would not shake Mr Trump's hand as he enters the chamber, citing the president's attacks on media and refusal to work with Congress. It will be the first time Mr Engel has not sought a centre aisle seat to shake the president's hand in his 29 years serving in the House.	Republicans are lining up against President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts to the State Department, hours before his address to Congress.
Steve Morgan said the planning system was the biggest barrier to new houses. The suggestion that housebuilders were sitting on landbanks in order to maximise profits was "completely incorrect", he told Radio 4's Today. Mr Morgan was speaking after Redrow revealed strong half-year results. The company reported that completed house sales were up 13% in the six months to December 2016 to 2,459 compared with the same period last year and pre-tax profits were up 35% to £140m. Redrow and other big builders have enjoyed big growth in profits for the last three years, but Mr Morgan said the industry was rebuilding its profitability after suffering heavy losses in the financial crisis. "Profits are growing, but this is a return to normal levels from a nil start," he said. The planning problem stemmed from difficulties in moving from outline permission - where a council says land is OK for housing - to detailed permission, when the builder can start work. "This can take normally one year, but up to two years," Mr Morgan said. Redrow has just short of 26,000 plots in its landbank. "At one-third of them, we just can't get on site." The planning process was also inhibiting supply by dissuading smaller builders from doing more. "It's not so bad for the big builders like us, but small companies face a wall of bureaucracy. If I was starting out today, I could not build up Redrow as I did." The housing White Paper proposed forcing housebuilders to surrender land if construction had not started two years after planning permission was granted. The current rule is three years. Mr Morgan said that if the time was counted from the grant of outline permission, it would make many projects "impossible". He said references in the White Paper to a "broken" market were "a bit disappointing" and added: "Actually, a lot has been done to increase output in the last few years, but of course, there is more to be done."	The chairman of one of the UK's top housebuilders, Redrow, has rejected accusations of land hoarding by the industry and called the government's housing White Paper "disappointing".
The retailer has been refurbishing the 160,000 sq ft store since last year, as work continues on a £1bn redevelopment of the shopping centre. It is creating an additional shopping floor, a new cafe and a tech product area as part of the revamp. The redevelopment includes a new entrance on Leith Street and parking spaces outside the shop. The layout of the premises is also being reconfigured, as the store prepares to be reconnected to the redeveloped St James Centre ahead of its scheduled opening in 2020. John Lewis said it expected most of the changes to be completed by the end of this month, with the final touches due to be completed by August. Barry Blamire, head of branch at John Lewis Edinburgh, said: "This is one of the biggest refurbishments the shop has seen in its 43 years and an incredibly exciting moment in our history."	John Lewis has unveiled details of the £24m revamp of its anchor store at the St James Centre in Edinburgh.
The Nigeria international has been on loan at Qatari club Al Ain this season. "I'm very happy and very excited that I'm here," 28-year-old Emenike told the club's website. "I have always known West Ham as a great club. I have known [manager Slaven] Bilic for years and thank God we are here together." Bilic previously managed Besiktas, based in Istanbul, Turkey - the city rivals of Fenerbahce. Emenike, who has scored nine goals in 37 international appearances, becomes the club's second signing of the January transfer window, after Leeds defender Sam Byram.

Ms Yellen said current valuations were "quite high", but added she did not see any bubbles forming. Chinese shares saw the biggest falls in the region with the Shanghai Composite closing down 2.8% at 4,112.21 - marking a third day of declines. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.3% at 27,289.97 - falling for the sixth day. Several companies on the mainland have announced share offerings through the week, leading investors to pull funds from other stocks. Investors were also worried about reported new moves by regulators to cool China's market, such as capping the size of margin financing and limiting the type of stocks investors can buy with borrowed money. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 1.23% at 19,291.99 after being closed all week for a holiday. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed down 0.82% at 5,645.70. Shares in Australia had suffered their biggest one-day fall in more than two years on Wednesday following disappointing results from Australia's biggest banks. Investors are concerned about the country's big four banks facing slower growth. National Australia Bank (NAB), the last of the big banks to announce their results this week, reported a 5.4% rise in cash profit for the six months to March. It also announced a 5.5bn Australian dollar ($4.4bn; Â£2.8bn) capital-raising exercise which will involve the selling of new shares. NAB wants to demerge and float its troubled British bank, Clydesdale, and shore up its balance sheet. The lender's capital-raising announcement has been reported by some of Australia's media as being the largest in the country's corporate history. Also weighing on investor confidence were the latest figures on Australia's unemployment rate, which showed a slight rise to 6.2% in April. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index closed down 0.65% at 2,091.00.	Asian shares fell on Thursday, tracking losses seen on US markets after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen expressed concerns over share valuations.
The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: "Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York." This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a "whinge-o-rama". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was "normal" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as "probably... my closest international partner these eight years". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: "Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate." So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. "For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States," he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.	In the arc of history, Britain has rarely flourished when it has had to choose between Europe and the United States.
The concept will be known as Vulcan, and it is expected to start operations in 2019. United Launch Alliance - the joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin - currently flies the Atlas and Delta rockets. These are routinely used to loft Nasa science probes, spy satellites and other US national security missions. In time, both vehicles will be retired as the new Vulcan components come on stream. The first element to be introduced will be the first-stage booster, which will feature an all-new, all-American liquid-fuelled engine. This will enable ULA to end its use of Russian-made RD-180 rocket motors – something Congress has mandated. Politicians on Capitol Hill dislike the fact that American national security missions are launched with the aid of Russian propulsion technology. ULA's preference is to incorporate a liquid methane-oxygen power unit currently being developed by Blue Origin, the space company run by Amazon entrepreneur Jeff Bezos. When the new Vulcan booster makes its debut, it will initially be married to the current Centaur upper-stage of the Atlas. But early in the 2020s, this too will be replaced by a bespoke upper-stage that should give the new rocket a performance that allows it to exceed even the Delta IV Heavy – the biggest, most powerful rocket in the world today, capable of putting upwards of 25 tonnes in a low-Earth orbit. Critically, though, the Vulcan will be substantially cheaper to build and operate. "A Delta IV Heavy at today’s launch rates costs about $400m, give or take, depending on the mission and its complexity. I fully expect the Next Generation Launch System to be less than half that," said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance. Some cost savings will be made by recovering and reusing the engines on the first-stage booster following a flight. The idea is that after separation from the upper-stage, the engines would detach from the propellant tanks and fall back to Earth, deploying an inflatable shield to protect them from burning up on re-entry into the atmosphere. Parachutes would then deploy and a helicopter would swoop in to pluck the engines out of the air and return them safely to the ground for servicing and re-integration into a new booster. ULA will not say how much the Vulcan development programme is costing, but it will run into the billions of dollars. ULA has to modernise, however. The priority status it has enjoyed with government contracts is coming to an end, and it is facing increasingly stiff competition – at home, from a bullish SpaceX company, whose low-cost rockets are winning favour with Nasa and commercial satellite operators; and abroad, where Europe and Russia are both moving to new-generation rocket systems that aim to reduce their launch prices also.	The company that conducts most of America's rocket launches has released details of its next generation vehicle.
In an interview with newspaper Die Zeit, Hitzlsperger said he was coming out to advance discussion of a topic that was "simply ignored" in German football. He is the most prominent footballer to publicly reveal his homosexuality and his former team-mates were quick to praise his announcement. Arsenal and Germany forward Lukas Podolski wrote on Twitter: "Respect to Thomas Hitzlsperger! That was a courageous and correct decision and an important step." And retired defender Arne Friedrich, who played with Hitzlsperger at Euro 2008, wrote: "Proud of you Thomas. A good decision and in my opinion the right time." There was also support for Hitzlsperger from leading figures in German football administration. "Finally, a footballer has the courage to make his sexuality public," said Theo Zwanziger, the former president of the German Football Association. Bundesliga president Reinhard Rauball said in a statement: "The decision of Thomas Hitzlsperger to be the first prominent footballer to make public his homosexuality is - even after his active career - a huge and courageous step, and surely leads the way in the fight against homophobia." Gary Lineker ‏@GaryLineker Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger on bravely being the first player to have played in the PL to 'come out' Joseph Barton ‏@Joey7Barton 15m Thomas Hitzlsperger has shown a lot of courage today. Sad times when people have to wait till they retire from their chosen profession... ...before the feel other people will judge them solely on who the human being is. Shame on all of us as a society. John Amaechi OBE ‏@JohnAmaechi Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger - welcome to the club! Bayern Munich, the club where Hitzlsperger began his career as a junior, also tweeted their support for the midfielder's "brave step". Hitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football. Zwanziger admitted that football was "now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted". Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality. "I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out," he wrote at the time. "I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay]." The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public. "It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him," Seibert told a media briefing. "We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance. "We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger." Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same. "I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo," he said. "It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same]." And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football. He said: "I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all."	German football has rallied around Thomas Hitzlsperger after the former international midfielder revealed he was gay.
Coleraine's Peter Chambers and Englishman Will Fletcher are into the semi-finals of the men's lightweight double sculls. Holly Nixon, Joel Cassells and Rebecca Shorten have all moved straight into Sunday's finals of their respective boat classes. Chambers and Fletcher began the quest for a lightweight double sculls European title fresh from their gold medal winning performance in the first World Cup regatta in Belgrade earlier this month. However they were forced to qualify for Saturday's semi-finals through the repechage after finishing behind Germany in their heat with only the winners progressing directly. The duo regrouped and in the afternoon session held off the fast finishing Greek boat to take first place. Ireland's Rio Olympics silver medal winning brothers, Gary and Paul O'Donovan, who are defending their European title won in Brandenburg twelve months ago, had to follow the same path as Chambers and Fletcher. They were beaten by Poland in their heat but won their repechage ahead of Ukraine. Enniskillen's Holly Nixon and her team mates Jess Leyden, Bethany Bryan and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne moved up from fourth place to second behind the Netherlands to claim an automatic qualifying place in Sunday's women's quadruple sculls final. With only five entrants in the women's eight an exhibition race took place to decide the lane draw for Sunday's final with Great Britain finishing second behind Romania. The GB crew includes Belfast's Rebecca Shorten who is making her senior international debut. Likewise Coleraine's Joel Cassells and partner Sam Scrimgeour were fourth in their lightweight pairs exhibition race behind winners Mark O'Donovan and Shane O'Driscoll from Ireland. Cassells is aiming for a third European gold medal in consecutive years.	Four rowers from Northern Ireland in the Great Britain squad have advanced from the heats at the European Championships in Racice, Czech Republic.
The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run. He is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf. All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him. The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities: Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a "Sam's Club Republican" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart). Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media. He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for "cap and trade" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time. His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response. Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008. John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004. The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the "trenches" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school. He served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.	US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is expected to name his vice-presidential running mate soon - possibly within days.
But this was far from the first time bungling contractors have been left with red faces. BBC News rounds up some of the gaffes that have hit the headlines. When a misspelt road marking appeared outside a school in Chester, the finger of blame was as usual pointed at hapless contractors. The lettering outside Highfield Community Primary School, in Blacon, was "claer" evidence that spelling was not the forte of the person who painted it. The marking was hastily corrected, at no cost to the council, after it appeared in February 2014. At least the simplest of fixes was possible when blundering workmen misspelled the word "minutes" as "minuites" at an NCP car park at Cambridge's railway station. Although it was two years before anything was done about the gaffe, eventually an NCP boss harnessed an inner Mick Jagger and gave the order: "I want it painted black." Thus the offending "I" was covered up to restore basic literacy to this corner of Cambridge. NCP said those responsible for the cock-up were "committed to playing Scrabble in their lunchtimes as spelling revision". A set of double yellow lines that appeared in Cardiff last summer couldn't be faulted in terms of execution - but the location chosen for the markings led to the city council being widely mocked. That's because the road on which the lines were painted is barely 5ft (1.5m) wide and too narrow for anything but a toy car. Despite the markings being branded "ridiculous" and a "waste of money", the beleaguered council stuck to its guns, arguing the double yellows were necessary to "deter anti-social parking on the narrow access lane". Motorists using a supermarket petrol station in Doncaster were amused to find themselves being directed towards a species of low-flying seabird. The word "petrel" was painted in 3ft letters, next to the flawlessly spelt word "exit" and some perfectly drawn arrows, on the approach to the pumps at the Sainsbury's Edenthorpe store in September 2016. In a light-hearted response, Sainsbury's said it was "correcting the misteke". Not wanting to let anything as inconvenient as a parked car get in their way, slapdash council contractors tasked with painting double yellow lines in a suburb of Leeds simply daubed the markings around the vehicle. However, once the car's owner returned and drove away, the lines were left sticking out from the kerb. Leeds City Council branded the markings in Hyde Terrace, Clarendon, as "ridiculous" and said it would remind contractors "to use common sense" in future. The lines were later repainted. Welsh-speaking drivers in Swansea were bemused to encounter a road sign that informed them: "I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated." Above the baffling statement on the dual-language sign was the correct wording in English: "No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only". The howler came about because a non-Welsh speaking council employee emailed the authority's in-house translation service, and took the response received as the translation being sought for the new road sign. Brensiach!	A wonky cycle path sign that appeared in the Lincolnshire market town of Sleaford last weekend caused much mirth among local residents, who described it as looking like a penny farthing - albeit one with angular wheels.
They want England, Wales and Northern Ireland brought in line with Scotland. The bill proposes amending the 1988 Road Traffic Act to lower the blood-alcohol concentration limit from 80mg alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg. The government said the current limit struck a balance between safety and personal freedom. The bill, which will be debated in the Lords on Friday, also proposes lowering the limits for alcohol in breath and urine when driving a vehicle. Because everyone has a different susceptibility to alcohol, health experts say it is difficult to quantify exactly how many units can be drunk before reaching the proposed new limit. For the average man, it would be just under a pint of beer or a large glass of wine and for women, half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine. In a letter to the Times, the Alcohol Health Alliance said the move would save lives and improve road safety. The alliance, which is made up of organisations including the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association and Alcohol Concern, said that at the current limit, drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident than those who have not drunk any alcohol. It said a vote in favour of the bill would signal to the government that "now is the time time to lower the drink-driving limit". Scotland lowered its drink-driving limit to the proposed new level in December 2014 and police figures show that drink-drive offences there fell by 17% in the first three months of 2015. Northern Ireland is currently consulting on whether to lower its limit. At present, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have one of the highest drink-driving limits in Europe. The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 50mg/100ml. Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance and honorary professor in clinical science at the University of Liverpool, said the overriding reason for lowering the limit was that "several hundreds of lives could be saved in England each year". And he said the scientific evidence for the change was strong. "There is a wealth of published, peer-reviewed, high quality research on the impact of alcohol on psychomotor skills and judgement. "While even low levels have an effect on these critical functions, the deterioration in performance moving from a blood level of 50 to 80mg per 100ml are striking." Prof Gilmore said there was public support for a lowering of the legal drink-drive limit at a time when drink-driving appears to be on the rise. The Local Government Association recently estimated that lowering the current limit would also save nearly Â£300m a year by reducing police and ambulance call-outs and hospital admissions. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: "The drink-driving limit for England and Wales strikes an important balance between safety and personal freedom. "By having our limit, we are not criminalising those who drink a small amount a long time before driving, but our advice remains unchanged: don't take the risk by driving after you have had a drink." People who have served road bans in England and Wales for serious drink-driving offences have to pass a medical examination before they can regain their licence.	A group of doctors and health experts is urging the House of Lords to support a bill to lower the drink-driving limit across the whole of the UK.
Dwindling domestic gas and coal supplies mean the nation would become dependent on volatile imports, it adds. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics for RenewableUK, said wind power saved the UK Â£579 million in fossil fuel costs in 2013. The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. "One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels," explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. "This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically." She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40% increase in gas prices by 30%, electricity prices would increase by 8%. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4%. "For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience," Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix "encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies". It observed: "Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met." In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were "not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets". He told BBC News: "The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. "What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments." Mr Norris said he advocated a "rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket". He added: "If you have different technologies, including renewables, competing against each other then the cost is driven down for the consumer."	Installing more wind turbines will make the UK's energy market more resilient to global fossil fuel price shocks, an independent report has concluded.
It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law. Under the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could "destroy, alter or subvert state institutions" or "damage national integrity or independence". This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison. The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise "whistle-blowing" under the crime of "espionage" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified. Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision. But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was "totalitarian" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law. US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have "undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism". With most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio. Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin. Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites. In recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public. Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium. Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity. The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest. In an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to "insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion". Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud. The editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal. "The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed," she told the BBC. Sizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down. "This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across." she said. However, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda. Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime. But following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square. According to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests. They were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people. A spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted "criminally" and the police force was within its rights to respond. "What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate," Ms Cutaia said. Although small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA. "The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations," Ms Cutaia says. "All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change. "Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard."	In a rare climbdown, the Angolan government has withdrawn controversial legislation severely restricting how people use the internet.
The 37-year-old, the fifth highest Test run-scorer in history, was given a guard of honour by India's fielders in the second Test in Colombo. He hit three fours before edging Ravichandran Ashwin to gully, leaving Sri Lanka 33-2 in pursuit of 413. Sangakkara ends his 134-Test career with 12,400 runs at an average of 57.40, with 38 centuries. The left-hander also played 404 one-day internationals and 56 Twenty20 internationals and also appeared in English county cricket for Warwickshire, Durham and Surrey, who he joined on a two-year contract in January. After breaking into the Sri Lanka side in 2000 as a wicketkeeper-batsman, he eventually relinquished the wicketkeeping gloves in Test cricket in 2008. He gave the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord's in 2011. Sri Lanka ended day four at the P Sara Oval on 72-2, with captain Angelo Mathews unbeaten on 23. England coach Trevor Bayliss, former coach of Sri Lanka, on BBC Test Match Special: "He's one of the legends of the game. He's one of those local heroes that a lot of people in Sri Lanka look up to, and he's been a great role model. He's had so many great innings over a period of time. The poise and time that he's got at the crease has been one of his hallmarks." Ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on BBC Test Match Special: "Sangakkara has been a beautiful player; a stylish, excellent batsman. Nearly all the great players have footwork and he has it. And I don't think there's any doubt he could carry on for two or three years. But you get tired mentally."	Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara made 18 in his final international innings before retirement.
Mancini said a fully-fit Tevez could wear the sky blue shirt again, despite previously asserting that the Argentina international was "finished" at City. Tevez remains at City after interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain failed to turn into a transfer. "If he comes back - and he is fit - it is possible," conceded Mancini. I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition Tevez, 27, remains in Argentina and, as yet, there has been no indication when the striker may return. "Carlos is not an option at the moment but it is possible in the future if he comes back," added Mancini. "I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition. "There is only one thing on my mind, the Barclays Premier League." Mancini has confirmed Owen Hargreaves remains available but has struggled to gain any consistent form during his time at City, triggering the deadline-day loan deal that saw David Pizarro move from Roma. "Owen always has these little problems," said Mancini. "When he came to us in the summer we took a gamble because he had not played for two years. "We thought we could try and get him fit in two or three months and then he would be able to play. "But, like any player who hasn't played for two years, when they start to train, every day there is a problem, with his knee or his hamstring. "I hope for him he eventually is able to play all the time. He deserves to." Club captain Vincent Kompany has insisted City have the mental strength to keep their title challenge on course. City have had a mixed set of results in January, allowing Manchester United to draw level with them on points at the top of the Premier League table. If people want to underestimate us, then please do so But Kompany expects his team-mates to thrive on the pressure as they aim for a first top-flight title since 1968. He said: "If anything it will give us a boost to carry on and if people want to underestimate us, then please do so." The pressure has increased on City in recent weeks, with their 1-0 league defeat at Everton on Tuesday night coming at the end of a period which included cup defeats by Liverpool and neighbours Manchester United. The Goodison Park defeat marked Kompany's return to the City team after a four-game suspension following his red card in the 3-2 FA Cup third round loss to United in January. And he says he expects City to bounce back from the disappointment against Everton with a win against Fulham at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. "There is no shame in going under at Everton," he said. "It wasn't enjoyable, but we believe we can go back to our best football and win the games that are left to play."	Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has named Carlos Tevez in his 25-man squad for the remainder of the season - and admitted he could pick him again.
The world number one, 32, beat Waters 11-2 11-5 11-4 in just 24 minutes at the National Squash Centre to secure a first national title since 2012. "I am really happy that I played well all week to win the title again," she told the tournament website. In the men's event, Nick Matthew beat James Willstrop 11-2 6-11 11-3 11-3 to win his eighth British title. World number three Matthew, 35, lost his first set of the week but recovered to win the final in 50 minutes.	Laura Massaro won her third British title with a straight-set final victory over Alison Waters in Manchester.
Eight-year-old Garfield, who makes the trip to Sainsbury's in Ely in Cambridgeshire on a daily basis, has his own Facebook page created by fans. Owner David Willers posted a message asking shoppers to lay off the treats as a vet found Garfield, who weighs 6.6kg (one stone), was overweight. "Everyone loves him," Mr Willers said. "The other day when it was cold and he stayed indoors, a member of Sainsbury's staff messaged me to ask where he was, which was very sweet. "He brings more customers into the shop - people tell me they go and shop there just to see him." Garfield's Facebook page was set up last summer by a couple who had spotted him in the shop, and is now run by Mr Willers. "We worry about him crossing the road, but we don't really get any negative comments about his habits," he said. "We live about a four-minute walk away from Sainsbury's but Garfield knows all the shortcuts so can get there quicker than that."	The owner of a cat which visits a supermarket every day, has had to ask people to stop feeding his pet because he was putting on weight.
Shopper Cornelius Price, 40, threw the six-pint bottle in a temper, Llandrindod Wells Magistrates' Court heard. It was claimed he was verbally abusive and escorted off the premises. Admitting criminal damage, Price said he threw the milk towards the store manager saying "catch it" but it accidentally spilt. "He was told to return the milk he was holding and leave the store and he threw it at the floor in temper," said Julie Sullivan, prosecuting. "£1.50 compensation is requested for the milk." Phil Sherrard, defending, said: "This is minor criminal damage. He knows he should have been more careful with the milk." Price was told to pay £1.50 compensation to Tesco, fined £75, ordered to pay £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs. The money will be deducted from his benefits at £10 a fortnight.	Supermarket giant Tesco has won £1.50 compensation from a customer who spilt a bottle of milk in one of its stores.
Official results by the Electoral Commission show that Mr Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) obtained more than 50% plus one vote required to beat his main rival, President John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress. The president-elect will be sworn in on January 7 after a one-month transition period. Mr Akufo-Addo had lost previous elections in 2008 and 2012 but the way he handled those losses resonated with many people. He is credited with preventing possible violence in 2012 by not rejecting the outcome - a loss by 300,000 votes to current President John Mahama - and calling for mass protests. Instead, he sought legal redress and accepted defeat after the Supreme Court upheld the result. The 72-year-old son of former chief justice and ceremonial President Edward Akufo-Addo retained his 2012 electoral promise to provide free high-school education. But the former lawyer, attorney general and foreign minister's main campaign promise was a "one district, one factory" policy that he says will industrialise the country. The plan is to establish factories in each of Ghana's 216 districts. "The time has come for us to move our industrial development forward," the presidential candidate told a rally in eastern Ghana. "There must be jobs in our country. The lack of jobs, which is the case under this government, poses a threat to the future stability of our country." In the north, Mr Akufo-Addo said there would be a functioning dam "in every village" to support agriculture. His critics, mainly from the NDC, have dismissed his promises as impossible to fulfil - but Mr Akufo-Addo insists they are not just gimmicks. Mr Akufo-Addo's wife Rebecca was part of his campaign. She told a TV show that he was a "very loving" family man. "He is also passionate about his politics. He's always cared about Ghana and wanted to do his bit for his country," she added. Mr Akufo-Addo is credited with helping to build up the NPP, which first contested an election in 1992 when Ghana returned to multiparty democracy after years of military rule. His political career spans more than four decades and he was active in political movements in his early 30s, when he criticised the military government of the time. He studied in both Ghana and the UK before working as a lawyer in France and served as an MP for the Abuakwa South constituency in eastern Ghana between 1996 and 2008.	Nana Akufo-Addo has been elected Ghana's next president at the third time of asking.
Englishwoman Evans, 29, is a 10-time ladies' champion. Doherty, 45, won the tournament in 1997, but the world number 43 has not reached the third round since 2006. The winner must make it through two more qualifying rounds to reach the main draw, which starts on 18 April. The tournament has increased this year from 128 to 144 players. The top 16 seeds automatically qualify for the first round, with all non-seeded players starting in the first of three qualifying rounds which run from 8-15 April. Evans received an invitation to the qualifying draw from snooker's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Six-time world champion Steve Davis is also attempting to qualify. He faces Jamie Cope in the first round of qualifying. Jimmy White, six times a runner-up at the Crucible, meets Thailand's James Wattana, while 2006 world champion Graeme Dott has been drawn against Mark Owens. Defending champion Mark Selby is the top seed, with five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan seeded second - the two met in last year's final.	Reanne Evans will face former world champion Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying as she bids to become the first woman to appear in the main stages of the World Championship.
"I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling." Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination. "I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness," she says, "Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis." But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. "Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five," he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: "One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some "age-memory" might be transferred into the next generation. "That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect," says Prof Sinclair. "A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age." The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down. But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones. "We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky", recalled Prof Sinclair, "or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals." Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans. Prof Sinclair said: "We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities." The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health. Follow Tom on Twitter.	Scientists are studying Dolly the sheep's "siblings" in order to study the health of cloned animals - and resolve a puzzle over whether they age normally.
Lasse Vibe netted a first-half double for the Bees which followed a Nico Yennaris close-range finish to make the result all but secure by half-time. Zach Clough scored a second-half consolation from the penalty spot for the Trotters after Alan McCormack was penalised for a foul. Bolton are 17 points from safety with six games remaining in the season. Defeat for Bolton extended their dreadful sequence of no away wins in a year and means defeat at Derby at the weekend will spell relegation for Wanderers. A second win in as many games for Brentford lifted them 12 points clear of the bottom three. Alan Judge was the creator of the home side's first chance when he almost looped a cross from the right over Ben Amos, but struck the bar. The midfielder provided a pinpoint cross from Vibe's second goal with a header, which was the Denmark striker's third goal in two games. Brentford manager Dean Smith: Media playback is not supported on this device "If you'd said to me three weeks ago that we'd have two wins on the spin at Nottingham Forest and again here, I'd have bitten your hand off. "It means we can go to Ipswich on Saturday and try to make it three wins in a row and then we can be looking at a top 10 finish. "I wanted more goals but with the run of form we've been on I wanted a result and that was the most important thing." Bolton caretaker manager Jimmy Phillips: Media playback is not supported on this device "We have to give the supporters something to cheer about rather than give them the kind of displays we gave in the first half tonight. "In the second half we were more competitive and we always say we have to compete before we can play. "Before the break we were nowhere near as competitive as we needed to be."	Bolton could be relegated to League One on Saturday after they were beaten by Brentford at Griffin Park.
The UK's economy grew by an estimated 0.7% in the April to June period, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. That compared with growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of the year. Output in the economy during the second quarter was 2.6% higher than the same period a year earlier, the ONS said. "After a slowdown in the first quarter of 2015, overall GDP growth has returned to that typical of the previous two years," said ONS chief economist Joe Grice. He added, however, that Tuesday's economic growth figure showed GDP per capita - economic growth as shared out among each member of the population - was back to "broadly level with its pre-economic downturn peak in 2008". The economy has now seen 10 quarters of sustained economic growth. The ONS said manufacturing output experienced its first fall in two years with output dropping 0.3% in the quarter. However, a surge in North Sea oil and gas production lifted overall industrial output by 1% - the biggest increase since late 2010. The "mining and quarrying" component of the industrial output figures, which includes oil and gas extraction, rose by 7.8% in the quarter, the biggest increase since 1989. The ONS said the increase, which came despite falling oil prices, was driven by tax cuts in March designed to support the sector. Construction was flat in the period, the ONS said, recovering from a slight fall the previous quarter. The UK's dominant services sector recorded growth of 0.7%, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous three months. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, as wages rise and with the temporary effects of low inflation boosting consumer spending. The ONS said there were also signs that businesses were finally increasing investment. The first estimate of GDP is based on about 40% of the economic data used in the final output estimate and is subject to revision.  The second estimate is due in about a month's time. Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC the figures showed that the UK was "motoring ahead". "Our economy [is] producing as much per person as ever before. But there are clear risks out there in the world economy from the eurozone to what's happening in the world's stock markets, and so its vital that we stay on the road that we've set out on," he added. But Labour's shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, told the BBC that Mr Osborne was "being very complacent". "Our economic growth really should be much stronger than this, especially with some of the mounting instability in the European economies, China, worldwide. We haven't seen the rebalancing of the recovery that we should have seen by now," he said. The latest growth figures come amid mounting pressure for a rise in interest rates following five years of rates sitting at the historic low of 0.5%. They also come a fortnight after Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested households should prepare for a rate rise towards the beginning of next year. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers and a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), pointed out that in five of the past six quarters, the UK economy had grown by 0.7% or more, suggesting the economic recovery was "well-established". Mr Sentence, who said recently that he would have voted to raise interest rates, were he still a member of the MPC, added that the UK was on course to grow by 2.6% in 2015 . "Against this background, higher interest rates should be firmly on the MPC agenda in the second half of this year," he said. Anna Leach, head of economic analysis at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), forecast that growth would remain "decent" through the rest of the year, helped by lower oil price and inflation, which she said would drive consumer spending and business activity. But she warned: "Performance is mixed across sectors, with UK manufacturers going through a tough time as the stronger pound hits sales into the eurozone. Meanwhile, the eurozone is still grappling with uncertainty over the Greek bailout."	UK economic growth accelerated in the second quarter of the year, helped by a big jump in oil and gas production, official figures have shown.
World number 127 Figueiredo was struggling at 4-1 down, but then took four frames to leave Ding clinging on. Ding, ranked fifth in the world, rallied to take the 10th frame and won a tense decider with a break of 74. The two-time UK Championship winner said: "I missed some easy shots." The 29-year-old, runner-up at this year's World Championship, added: "He played well and made a few 50 breaks. But at 5-4 down I told myself to carry on and I knew that pressure would come so I was confident in the last two frames." Barry Hawkins, another former Crucible runner-up, whitewashed Welshman David John 6-0. Marco Fu saw off Ireland's Josh Boileau 6-2 but the ever-popular Jimmy White was on the wrong end of the same scoreline against Wales' Ryan Day. White, the winner of 10 ranking events including the 1992 UK Championship, drew level at 2-2 but could not maintain his form after the interval. The 2011 champion Judd Trump, world number 13 Kyren Wilson, and Scotland's Anthony McGill are all in action in the evening session.	China's Ding Junhui survived a first-round scare to beat Brazilian outsider Igor Figueiredo 6-5 in a thrilling UK Championship match at the York Barbican.
The Ulster Gazette carries the story of a Portadown man who was stopped on his way back from a Bulgarian 'lad's holiday' with a knuckle duster, stun device, extendable baton and pepper spray. Conor Seeley, 23, of Charlestown Road, contested eight charges against him, but a district judge found him guilty of all the offences. He said: "When people come back from Spain they bring sombreros and donkeys, you brought back pepper spray." A border force officer giving evidence in the case told the court that "lots" of offensive weapons are brought in from Bulgaria and flights from the area were "high profile" for that reason. Also in the paper is "utter devastation" in Armagh following the death of 55-year-old Barry Toal in a house fire last week. The Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Gareth Keating, said: "This is a tight-knit community and we will do what we can to support those affected by this tragedy." In the Antrim Guardian, a former lifeguard is hailed a hero after he rescued a man from drowning in the Six Mile Water river in the town. Graham Vaughan, 22, raced from his home through the centre of Antrim to the opposite side of the bank of the river in the early hours of last Tuesday after he heard screaming. "I looked outside and I could see a woman on the banks and a taxi," he told the paper. "She was shouting for help and pointing and I could see someone in the river. "I just ran, I wasn't even thinking, I was still in my shorts." Mr Vaughan said his lifeguard training came in handy even after the man was dragged from the water. "Just the little things like checking for ID, talking to him and checking his eyes and pulse are important," he said. Thankfully, the police said the man would make a full recovery from his ordeal. Inside the paper we go from a hero to a villain as South Antrim MP Danny Kinahan recalls being just yards away from the Westminster attack last Wednesday. Mr Kinahan told the paper he was about to go into the chamber to take part in a vote when he heard the commotion outside. "There was a lot of screaming and shouting and shouts and 'get downs' - word spread very quickly," he said. "Business was suspended and we were told we were in lockdown. "We had all been aware there had been training exercises for this sort of thing so when the dreadful day finally came it swung into action." In the Lurgan Mail is a celebration of Special Olympian Caolán McConville. The Aghagallan lad won a silver and a bronze medal at the World Winter Games in Austria and also led Team Ireland out at the official opening ceremony. His picture is given pride of place on the paper's front page along with his granny, Margaret. The skier was welcomed back to his home town last Saturday by friends and family and given a "hero's welcome" as he proudly displayed his medals. He said: "I went down the Giant Slalom and it was hard, I fell over but I picked myself up again and went really fast." The paper also reports on the court case of a learner driver who was caught speeding when he overtook a police car. Jason Stephen Lavery, of Brownlow Terrace in Lisburn had been driving at 98mph when he was caught with no license or insurance in October last year. The Coleraine Times reports on a "backlash" over a book of condolences for former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. The book was opened in the council offices in Coleraine follwing his death last Tuesday. TUV councillors Boyd Douglas, William Blair and Alderman Sharon McKillop said in a joint statement that the book was "an insult to victims". "The decision of the SDLP mayor to open a book of condolences to self-confessed IRA commander McGuinness is an unnecessarily divisive act. "It is insulting to many victims of IRA violence who have had to listen to nauseating praise of someone whose wicked terrorist organisation visited death and destruction on many families in Ulster." But the front page of the paper has a much more positive vibe - with a declaration that the town has "a new lease of life" now that a £220k rejuvenation scheme has come to an end. The investment involved about 70 businesses and has given a new look to some of the town's streets. The Impartial Reporter leads with a story about a Fermanagh man who they report was detained in Boston after he outstayed his visa for five years. The "undocumented immigrant" recently married an American and faces an anxious wait as President Trump continues to crack down on illegal immigrants. The man's Boston-based lawyer said: "Just by his tone Mr Trump has "unleashed the dogs in the system and is taking a much harsher, blunter approach. "It has already got more serious." Also on the front page of the paper is local actor-turned-author, Ciarán McMenamin, who has released his first book - Skintown. The story follows Vinny Duffy, trapped working in a takeaway as the wider world falls in to the drug-driven dawn of rave culture. A random act of kindness leads Vinny to the most unlikely business opportunity. The novel is described as "a supercharged debut, zinging with confidence and intelligence" in a review by novelist Joseph O'Connor. In the Ulster Herald there's a warning about farm safety from the son of a man who died after a bull attack. Raymond McClinchey's father Alex was 75 and on the family farm near Omagh on Tuesday when the incident happened. Mr McClinchey said: "I just hope that this is the last death like this, but know that unfortunately it probably won't be. "Maybe my father's death will save another life by making farmers act on the need for safety. "Please don't take chances." Also in the paper is an investigation which is ongoing after a major slurry spill near Omagh which forced the closure of the main A5 route on Monday. According to the paper there are fears that the spill could pollute the area's waterways. The Environment Agency confirmed to the paper that the slurry had entered a local stream. It is not known, however, what impact that will have.	'Man on 11-day booze binge caught with deadly weapons at airport' - well, that'll get the weekly paper review started.
In August, Scott initiated the investigation into a "disappointing" Olympic campaign that produced three medals from a target of five to seven. A key finding of the report required Australia-based Scott to relocate to Britain, something he was unable to do. Scott, who has been performance director since 2007, will step aside at the end of the month. The Australian's removal allows British swimming to begin the search for a new performance director as attention turns to the next Olympics in Rio in four years' time. "I respect this conclusion from the performance review I initiated following our results in London," Scott said. "I wanted to make sure we left no stone unturned in understanding why we didn't achieve our goals. "One of the key findings of the review requires a change to my current working practice by being based in Britain. However, for personal and family reasons, I'm unable to meet this recommendation and therefore offered my resignation."	British Swimming's performance director Michael Scott has resigned following a review into results at London 2012.
West Yorkshire Police said the arrests were made between 30 May and 8 June by targeting known offenders and encouraging people to report abuse. The force said the campaign was prompted by the "worryingly high volume of calls" it received during previous major football tournaments. During Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup domestic abuse calls rose by a third. The force said it received around 110 calls reporting abuse during each of England's games in those tournaments. England's first match in Euro 2016 is against Russia in Marseilles on Saturday evening. Det Supt Darren Minton said: "With a kick off at 20:00 we expect that many people will be drinking ahead of that time and whilst we want everyone to enjoy the football, we are also aware that during previous tournaments we have seen an increase in domestic abuse. "Inflamed passions and excess alcohol on a match day or any other day is no excuse for aggressive, controlling or violent behaviour. And any forms of abuse will be met by the full force of the law."	More than 400 people have been arrested for domestic abuse offences ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament.
The Mariners, back in League Two after a six-year absence, looked nervy early on and former England striker Darren Bent twice went close for the Rams. Derby made the breakthrough when captain Keogh stooped at the far post to head home Craig Bryson's cross. Shaun Pearson saw his header saved for Grimsby and Kayden Jackson's shot was cleared off the line in injury time. Match ends, Derby County 1, Grimsby Town 0.

However, it said the girls abducted from a school in Chibok in April 2014 were not among them. The military said the girls and women were freed during major operations ending in the seizure of four Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest. A military spokesman said they were now being interviewed. Weapons were also seized at the camps taken in the latest operation, the military said. In recent months Nigerian security forces have taken back most of the territory previously under the control of Boko Haram, the BBC's Tomi Oladipo reports from Lagos. Gen Chris Olukolade said the hostages were freed as part of a major, ongoing operation. He said accurate intelligence had helped the military locate the camps, which had been attacked from all directions by ground and air forces. Last October, the government said it had secured an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of the girls taken from Chibok, but Boko Haram subsequently denied this. The abduction of the girls in Chibok sparked global outrage with many joining a campaign online to free them using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Several nations including the US and China vowed to help find them and there have been reported sightings of the girls, but none has been found to date. Meanwhile, the government of neighbouring Niger gave more details about fighting between its troops and Boko Haram on an island in Lake Chad over the weekend. It says 28 civilians died when Boko Haram attacked Karamga island and that 46 of its troops died in the battle for the island, along with more than 150 militants. Reports in local media have given a much higher death toll for government forces. Boko Haram's insurgency, and the army campaign against it, have killed more than 15,500 people since 2012. The violence has recently spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon.	The Nigerian military says it has rescued 200 girls and 93 women from an area where the Islamist militant group Boko Haram is active.
In September the 20-year-old opted to play for England over the Republic of Ireland and has been awaiting clearance from Fifa. Grealish played for the Republic at under-21s level but turned down a call-up to the senior squad for a friendly against England in June. Birmingham-born Grealish qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents. After an impressive first full year for Villa, Grealish has struggled this season, making only 17 appearances and scoring once. He has been struggling with an ankle problem and has not featured since coming on as a substitute against Manchester City in the FA Cup on 30 January.	Fifa has given Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish permission to play for England.
The rock is an eroded volcano that lies 260 miles (418km) west of the Western Isles and is only 30m (100ft) wide and 21m (70ft) high above the sea. The Nato documents report how the UK claimed Rockall in 1955. The government feared that it could be used by "hostile agents" as a place to monitor the Hebrides Rocket Range. A small team of military personnel was taken to Rockall by the Royal Navy in September 1955 to claim as UK territory. A Union Flag was raised and a plaque installed on the rock. In the documents, it says: "This decision of the UK government was connected with the fact that the UK government had recently decided to set up a guided missile range in South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides. "The island of Rockall was uninhabited but this government wished to guard against the possibility of hostile agents installing themselves on the island in order to observe the effects of the tests on the South Uist range." People have stayed on Rockall, though only temporarily, in the past, including in 1997 when three campaigners from Greenpeace managed to climb on to the rock. They lived on Rockall for 42 days and renamed it Waveland in protest at exploration of new oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabed. In 2014, a Scots adventurer broke the record for occupying the remote North Atlantic rock. Adventurer Nick Hancock survived on there for 43 days, beating the previous record held by three Greenpeace campaigners who lived there for 42 days. The time also beat the previous solo record of 40 days set by Tom McClean in 1985. Mr Hancock celebrated achieving the solo record by popping a small bottle of champagne while also sending a tweet with a message to veteran adventurer Mr McClean, of Morar in the west Highlands. His message was simply: "Sorry Tom."	Declassified documents reveal concerns of the UK government 60 years ago that Rockall could become a base for spying on a missile test site.
State department officials and Mr Bae's sister were quoted as saying the 45-year-old had been returned from a hospital to the camp on 20 January. Mr Bae, a Korean-American, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May. North Korea says he used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government. He was taken to hospital last year after suffering dramatic weight loss. His family say he has several health complaints including diabetes and liver problems. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Washington had learned about Mr Bae's transfer to the camp from representatives of the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which acts on behalf of the US in North Korea. Ms Psaki said the Swedish diplomats "have met Mr Bae 10 times since his detention, most recently on 7 February in a labour camp". She added: "We continue to urge DPRK (North Korean) authorities to grant Mr Bae special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds". Ms Psaki did not specify when Mr Bae had been forced back to the camp. However, a US state department official and Mr Bae's sister confirmed the 20 January date. "He's back to eight-hours-a-day, six-days-a-week hard labour," Terri Chung, Mr Bae's sister, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. Pyongyang has so far made no official comment on the reports. On Thursday, US President Barack Obama used the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington to say: "We pray for Kenneth Bae, a Christian missionary who has been left in North Korea for 15 months." "His family wants him home, and the United States will continue to do everything in our power to secure his release because Kenneth Bae deserves to be free." If the details of his transfer are confirmed, it would mean Mr Bae was returned to the camp on the same day as he spoke to foreign media in North Korea under heavy prison guard - his first "press conference" since the detention. Mr Bae denied media reports that he had been badly treated and called for US "co-operation" to secure his release. Correspondents say he may have been speaking under strict editorial control. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytising. They were released after visits to Pyongyang by high-profile officials, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.	A US citizen held for more than a year in North Korea has been moved back to a labour camp, US officials say.
The match was due to take place on Thursday but was rescheduled due to a frozen pitch at Stade des Alpes. Davies started ahead of Biggar at fly-half in their Pro12 win against Edinburgh on Friday, 2 December. Veteran Paul James comes in for Nicky Smith at loose-head prop and Dmitri Arhip is at tight-head for Ma'afu Fia. Wales hooker Scott Baldwin is undergoing a head injury assessment and is omitted from the Ospreys' line-up. In midfield, centre Ashley Beck makes way for Kieron Fonotia while prop Fia has a shoulder injury that has put him out of contention. Ospreys are playing in the second-tier European tournament for the first time and have a 100% record after wins over Newcastle Falcons and Lyon. Grenoble lost heavily when they played the same teams. The two teams meet again on Saturday, 17 December. Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy told BBC Radio Wales: "It's pretty poor and disappointing. We came down to the ground at 3pm and the ground was hard. The blowers and a little bit of hot air has gone on it to try and rectify it but I think it was too little too late. "It's bitterly disappointing, it affects preparations. Now we've got to stay out here. It's not as if it's an anomaly where you come here and there's a big blizzard. "There's definitely been a lack of preparation and thought gone into it and for such a big game for us, we're bitterly disappointed we haven't played the game tonight." Grenoble: Armand Batlle; Pierre Mignot,Clement Gelin, Nigel Hunt, Tino Nemani; Gilles Bosch, David Mele;  Alexandre Dardet, tienne Fourcade, Walter Desmaison, Mickael Capelli,  Mathias Marie, Kevin Kornath, Steven Setephano, Dylan Hayes.

The animal, thought to be a juvenile minke whale, is about 4m long. It was first seen on Thursday morning and seems to be healthy and content. Minke whales are one of the most common in our waters. It is thought it may have swum in in pursuit of fish in the channel. A fully-grown minke can grow to 9m in length. The harbour authorities are liaising with experts in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, and are expected to monitor the animal for several days in the hope it returns to open water. There are no immediate grounds for concern over the animal's health, said the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA). "Minke whales frequent the waters around the mouth of Belfast Lough, but young or inquisitive animals will, on occasion, come closer inshore," said a spokesperson. "However, our Marine and Fisheries team will continue to monitor the whale's behaviour in conjunction with colleagues from Belfast Harbour Commissioners. "The animal is currently in a well-regulated area within Belfast Harbour where there is no risk of disturbance. "The whale is not in an area that is easily viewable by the public, however, as a marine-protected species, people are advised to enjoy any views they are fortunate to have of this remarkable animal but not to approach or do anything to disturb it," the statement added.	A whale has been spotted in Belfast Harbour.
The 27-year-old Polish man was discovered at a property in Brothertoft Road, Boston, on Saturday. Three men, who were arrested on Saturday in Larkspur Croft, where a firearm was recovered, were bailed on Monday. Chf Insp Paul Timmins, of Lincolnshire Police, said the shooting may have been planned. "The investigation is at an early stage, however the incident does not appear to have been a random offence and I can now confirm that two outstanding suspects have been located and arrested," he said. The man has been treated at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.	Two more arrests have been made after a man was found with gunshot wounds in Lincolnshire.
Ravindra Gaikwad said he "hit him 25 times with my sandal" for "arrogance" after failing to get a business class seat on an Air India flight. Air India, which filed a complaint on Thursday, said Mr Gaikwad was banned on all flights operated by the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA). Members of the FIA include IndiGo, Go Air, Spice Jet and Jet Airways. All the airlines are dominant players in India's domestic aviation industry. In a statement, the FIA also called for "strict action" against Mr Gaikwad by law enforcement agencies. "We believe that an assault on any one of our employees is an assault on all of us and on ordinary law-abiding citizens of our country who work hard to earn a living," the statement said. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association has also issued a statement, saying that it has asked its member pilots not to operate any flight on which Mr Gaikwad is a passenger. The MP had been told he could not fly business class on the Pune to Delhi flight because it was an all-economy flight, reports say. The altercation happened when the duty manager was called after the plane landed in Delhi and the MP refused to get off. The MP told the media: "I am not a BJP MP. I am a Shiv Sena MP and will not tolerate any insult. Let the employee complain. I will complain to the Speaker and other authorities." On Friday he continued to insist that he would not apologise to the employee, identified as a 60-year-old man. The airline staff member told Asian News International that the MP had broken his glasses in the attack. "When I told him what he was asking wasn't possible, he became abusive and started using foul language," he said. "God save our country if this is the culture and behaviour of our MPs." The story was the top trending topic on Twitter in India on Thursday. Ashok Ganapathi Raju, the civil aviation minister, told reporters at parliament on Thursday: "No citizen will behave like this. Physical assault won't be encouraged and will always be condemned." Last year an Indian MP was arrested for alleging slapping an airline official at an airport in Andhra Pradesh after being told he could not board a flight with his family after the gate had closed. The Shiv Sena party is a junior coalition partner in the Maharashtra state government, which is ruled by India's governing BJP. Over time, it has acquired a reputation for promoting religious and ethnic chauvinism, and has resorted to physical attacks against those its members and supporters oppose. In 2015, Shiv Sena activists doused the head of an Indian think-tank in black ink to protest against his support for the launch of a book by a former Pakistani foreign minister.	An MP who beat an airline employee repeatedly with a slipper has been banned on five major Indian airlines.
His body was found on concrete steps in North Street in the early hours of Sunday morning. He was treated by medical staff but was pronounced dead at the scene. Gardaí (Irish police) have appealed for information about the incident.	A man in his 50s has died after being seriously assaulted in Swords, County Dublin.
After their engine failed and their anchor was lost off the coast of India's Andhra Pradesh state in June last year, the men were left stranded in dangerous waters. They drifted helplessly for a week in the Bay of Bengal until an oil tanker under the command of Capt Menon came to their rescue. Her efforts have now been recognised with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Award for Exceptional Bravery at Sea, handed out in London on Monday. Not only is Capt Menon the first female captain in the Indian Merchant Navy, but she is the only woman to have won the award, which recognises those who risk their own lives to save others at sea. As waves rose to 9m and wind speed reached 60-70 knots, she commanded a rescue operation last June that required three attempts to get the fishermen onboard the massive tanker via a pilot ladder from their small boat. The Sampurna Swarajya tanker's second officer had earlier spotted the fishing boat 2.5km away off the coast of Gopalpur in Orissa. The men had been surviving off ice from their cold storage after food and drinking supplies were washed away. "The sea was very, very turbulent, there was a depression... which was stagnant for two or three days and it had intensified into a deep depression," Capt Menon told BBC World News TV. "It was a very difficult task but we had to do it because if I didn't do that I was knowing very well that these fishermen never stood a chance of rescue, no survival at all." As far as being a path-breaking female ship captain goes, Radhika Menon doesn't appear to make a big deal of it. She says gender means little on the kind of ships she works on. "[It is] gender neutral in the sense that even if you are female, you know how to do your job," she says. "People appreciate you, they respect you, you'll be able to carry out your orders and all that."	Seven fishermen owe Captain Radhika Menon their lives.
Organisers said about 10,000 people were expected, in the city's biggest show of solidarity with foreigners. At least five people have been killed and foreign-owned shops looted in attacks since last week. The influential Zulu king has been accused of fuelling the violence - charges he denies. For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page. Locals accuse foreigners of taking their jobs in a country where the official unemployment rate is 24%. Tens of thousands of foreigners, mostly from other African states and Asia, have moved to South Africa since white-minority rule ended in 1994.

President Xi Jinping said China's "territorial sovereignty and marine rights" in the seas would not be affected by the ruling "in any way". But he insisted China was still "committed to resolving disputes" with its neighbours. The Philippines brought the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The tribunal, based in the Hague, ruled that there was no evidence that China had historic rights to the waters or resources that fell within its "nine-dash line", and was violating the Philippine's sovereign rights with its operations there. The ruling was made by an arbitration tribunal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers of enforcement. The Philippines has had diplomatic spats with China over the Scarborough Shoal and Spratlys in particular. It says China's "nine-dash line", which China uses to demarcate its territorial claims, is unlawful under the UNCLOS convention. Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have competing claims in the region. Although these islands are largely uninhabited, they may have reserves of natural resources around them. There has been little detailed exploration of the area, so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas. The sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region. Chinese media were quick to take the official line that Beijing would not recognise the ruling. China's state news agency Xinhua said that "as the panel has no jurisdiction, its decision is naturally null and void". The Philippine government welcomed the ruling as a "milestone decision", but there was little outright celebration. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Manila says this may be due to a recent change of government - many Filipinos believe newly-elected President Rodrigo Duterte may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response. There was more delight among Philippine social media users, who dubbed the ruling #CHexit. Both the US and Japan urged both sides to abide by the ruling. The US called it an "important contribution to the shared goal of a peaceful resolution to disputes in the South China Sea". But Taiwan rejected the tribunal's findings on an area it administers, saying the ruling had "seriously damaged" its rights and would "definitely not accept this ruling". The US sent an aircraft carrier and fighter jets to the region ahead of the decision, while the Chinese navy has been carrying out exercises near the disputed Paracel islands. This result represents a major loss of face for China, and yet the first response from Beijing to the UN tribunal's demolition of its claims seems be rather conciliatory. On the one hand, the Chinese government has re-stated that it has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the area and that the activities of its people there date back to over 2,000 years ago. However, it then goes on to talk about "consultation with the states directly concerned" and proposes "joint development in relevant maritime areas". Airlines and shipping companies will be pleased to hear that China has also restated that it respects "freedom of navigation and over flight enjoyed by all states under international law in the South China Sea" and that it stands ready to ensure "unimpeded access to international shipping lanes". All this seems to point towards Beijing possibly seeking some sort of negotiated settlement rather than ramping up the pressure on the Philippines following Manila's comprehensive victory in The Hague.	China has firmly rejected an international tribunal ruling that its claims to rights in the South China Sea have no legal basis.
Media playback is not supported on this device The new pay deal with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) means an England international will earn up to £300,000 each year in match fees alone. Along with their club salaries, bonuses and commercial income, an elite player could soon top seven figures per year. "The market place dictates what they deserve," Rugby Players' Association chief executive Hopley told BBC Sport. "If players are successful and conduct themselves in a way that is becoming to that role model status, then I think they do deserve it." The latest RFU accounts showed record profits following the 2015 Rugby World Cup. "The players generate huge amounts of money for the game," Hopley added. "In the context of the revenues being generated through English rugby, it's a very reasonable deal. "We wanted to ensure that the players felt they were participating in the commercial upside of the RFU - and despite a disappointing World Cup for everyone, we have seen a fantastic year around English rugby revenues. "England players in 2003 won £70,000 each for winning the World Cup, while players in this Old Mutual Wealth Series will pick up more than that for playing in four games for England." Mark Lambert, the vice-chairman of the RPA, denies that the new deal will lead to a disconnect between elite England players and the rest. "The way you earn respect as a rugby player is the way you carry yourself, the way you behave, and the example you set for other people," the Harlequins prop told BBC Sport. "All the [Harlequins] guys that have come through the system and gone on to represent England internationally, they are model professionals and deserve what they have achieved in the game. "We would all like to be earning that money, but it's something that's directly linked to the revenues of the RFU," added Lambert, who has made more than 200 top-flight appearances for Quins. "The RFU make a lot of money and it's only right the England players get that. There is potential for players to make a good amount of money, but you have to put in that hard work first in order to get there." The RPA last week held its quarterly board meeting with a variety of issues on the agenda, from artificial pitches to the new rugby calendar. Hopley says the players' union would fully support the notion of a fallow summer in the calendar post-2019, as revealed by the BBC in September, adding: "The players' voice is on the rise, and rightly so." Lambert said: "It is more important than ever that the players have a strong voice. "The game is expanding, there is a lot of money and there is lot of opportunity - and we need to make sure the player doesn't get pulled in too many directions. "It's an exciting time, but we have got to make sure the game stays the same at its core."	A top English player deserves to make £1m a year, says players' union boss Damian Hopley.
The company has been negotiating with the pension regulator and the PPF in a bid to offload its pension liabilities and a decision is expected soon. Most, if not all, members of the scheme would see a reduction in benefits. Those under retirement age would receive an immediate 10% cut in their pension pot. In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the PPF than if the Hoover scheme continued. At about £500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as BHS. BHS pensions is already receiving compensation from PPF which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme. BHS is being assessed for take-over by the organisation. The Hoover scheme has a deficit of about £250m. Parent company Hoover Candy stopped producing washing machines in Merthyr Tydfil in 2009, blaming competition in the marketplace. More than 300 workers lost their jobs although there is still a head office and a distribution warehouse in the town. It is believed about half of the Hoover pension scheme's 7,800 members live in Wales. Pensions expert Stuart Price, partner at Quantum Advisory, said: "Members of the pension schemes will lose out on their benefits but, on the flipside, those still employed by the company will retain their jobs. "At the moment they [members] don't know what's happening so they can't really plan for their short-term future. "If they get a 10% reduction [for those under 65] and lower increases in the future they might find it very hard to overcome." Will you be affected by a change to the Hoover pensions scheme? You can contact us in the following ways: Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.	Up to 4,000 people in Wales could be affected if the Hoover pension scheme goes into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), BBC Wales understands.
Gian-Franco Kasper, a Swiss ski official, made the comparison during an IOC board meeting in Pyeongchang. The board is debating whether to suspend the entire Russian team from the Games following a doping scandal. "I apologise unreservedly for any offence I have caused. I am truly sorry," Franco Kasper said. The International Ski Federation President was discussing a proposed blanket ban on Russian athletes when he made the Holocaust comment, referring to the World War II genocide that saw six million Jews killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. He reportedly said: "I'm just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like Mr Hitler did - all Jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do." When challenged by reporters at the time, Franco Kasper responded: "Why not? Of course it's more extreme. But just the fact that the place you come from makes you guilty, I'm not OK for this, really not." Russia did not receive a blanket ban from the IOC from the 2016 Olympics in Rio, opting to leave the decision to individual sports' governing bodies. A report in December 2016 claimed Russian medallists from summer and winter Olympics had benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015.	An International Olympic Committee (IOC) board member has apologised for comparing calls to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics to the Holocaust.
An "in-depth investigation" will look into claims made by Veracruz governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares on Monday, the Ministry of Health said. He alleged fake medicine had been bought and used in state hospitals under his predecessor Javier Duarte. Mr Duarte has been on the run from the authorities since October. The former governor, who was elected in 2010,  has not been seen since a week after he stepped down amid allegations of corruption. He has been charged with organised crime and money laundering, but there are calls for the Attorney General's office to file criminal charges relating to the latest accusations. On Monday, Mr Yunes Linares told a press conference that an investigation into malfeasance and corruption under Mr Duarte had uncovered medical fraud. `We have tests on a medication given to children, a paediatric chemotherapy that wasn't really a medication, it was an inert substance, practically distilled water,'' he said. "This really seems to us a brutal crime, an attempt against the lives of the children. We're finishing our analysis and, at the appropriate time, we'll be filing legal complaints." Mr Yunes Linares also alleged there had been inadequate tests for HIV detection and the existence of outdated medicines. The allegations have shocked Mexico. "It is absolutely inhuman, criminal," Senator Roberto Gil Zuart said, according to Mexican news site Quadratin. Mexico's Secretary of Health JosÃ© Narro Robles has promised to act on "the persons or companies involved" if irregularities or responsibility is found, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.	Mexican authorities are to investigate allegations children battling cancer were given "distilled water" instead of chemotherapy.
No 10 said: "We don't accept threats have been made." It is understood spokesman Craig Oliver phoned the Daily Telegraph's editor after his paper wrote a story about Maria Miller's expense claims. He reportedly told him the story was poorly timed. Mr Oliver is alleged, by the Daily Telegraph, to have told the editor, Tony Gallagher, that Mrs Miller was "looking at Leveson at the moment". Twenty-four hours earlier, Mrs Miller's special adviser Joanna Hindley called the  reporter working on the story to "flag up" the culture secretary's role in drawing up new press regulation rules, following Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics. A No 10 spokesman defended Mr Oliver's intervention and rejected suggestions he - or Mrs Miller's  adviser - were seeking to influence the paper against pursuing the story. They said Mr Oliver was simply raising "concerns" with the newspaper about the way the story was being pursued and the fact Mrs Miller's "elderly father had been door-stepped" by a reporter. The spokesman added: "The secretary of state had some concerns about the way that investigation was being conducted and Craig Oliver was simply reflecting those concerns." Labour MP John Mann has written to John Lyon, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, after it emerged Mrs Miller had allowed her parents to live at a property on which she claimed Â£90,718 in second home allowances during the last parliament. Mrs Miller has said her expenses were "absolutely in order" and "in complete accordance with the rules". Her parents, John and June Lewis, have apparently been living at the property since selling their home in Wales in 1996. According to the Telegraph, Miss Hindley told its reporter: "Maria has obviously been having quite a lot of editors' meetings around Leveson at the moment. So I am just going to kind of flag up that connection for you to think about." Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, which is campaigning for the setting up of an independent press regulator via a change in the law, said: "This story illustrates exactly why ministers must be kept at arm's length from the regulation of the press. "It cannot be right that politicians who are subject to the scrutiny of the newspapers and who are constantly vulnerable to public challenge in this way are sitting down with editors and proprietors of those same newspapers to design a press regulation system." A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: "Mrs Miller's special adviser raised concerns with a journalist about the nature of an approach to Mrs Miller's elderly father. Her adviser noted that Mrs Miller was in regular contact with the paper's editor and would raise her concerns directly with him, which Mrs Miller did subsequently. "However, this is a separate issue to ongoing discussions about press regulation. Mrs Miller has made the government's position on this clear."	Downing Street has denied that the PM's spokesman warned a newspaper against running a critical story on the culture secretary's expenses because of her role in enacting the Leveson proposals.
Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries. The HRW report focuses on the treatment of a Christian group in Vietnam. The group said the Thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year. Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could "have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam". It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month. The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as "evil". Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was "very disappointing". "Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule," he added. Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.	Thailand's military-run government has forced Human Rights Watch (HRW) to cancel an event in Bangkok to launch a report into alleged abuses in Vietnam.
The game features cards with a series of quiz questions, but some of the answers given are incorrect. One answer claims the moon is 225 miles away from the earth - instead of about 238,900 miles. Manufacturers Paul Lamond Games said they "unreservedly apologise" and added replacement cards would be issued. It is understood at least six of the 50 answers in one round of the game - which costs Â£19.99 - are incorrect. One answer placed Stonehenge in Somerset instead of Wiltshire and a maths question suggested two cubed was bigger than three squared. It also said Albert Einstein died in 1949 instead of 1955 and gave the number of Coronation Street episodes to date as 8,000, when the actual figure is more than 9,000. One customer who bought the game told The Sun: "I couldn't believe it, the answers are so ridiculous... [but] the kids won't accept the game could possibly be wrong." A representative for Paul Lamond Games told the BBC: "We have been made aware of some mistakes with the answers to the questions within the first production run of this game." "These have now been corrected and we would like to unreservedly apologise for these errors. "Any affected customer can email us stating their name and full address and we will send out a replacement set of corrected cards free of charge." The company's email address is available on their official website.

Chris Maguire struck a brilliant free-kick from 23 yards in stoppage time to give the U's victory. The Bantams, who had been undefeated in their first 15 games of the campaign, stay second in League One but they will be cursing Billy Clarke's penalty miss in the 21st minute. Charlie Raglan tripped Timothee Dieng to concede the spot-kick, but Clarke smashed the penalty against the crossbar. Before that, Maguire twice went close for the U's, with City keeper Colin Doyle pushing aside his 15-yard volley, and later saving the striker's header. Bradford then began to control possession and Jordy Hiwula should have done better than sky a volley from 10 yards out. Simon Eastwood saved at the feet of Clarke as the visitors continued to create opportunities. Hiwula missed badly from four yards out in the second half before Oxford began to look dangerous. Ryan Taylor had an effort saved and Chey Dunkley saw his header from a corner blocked on the goal line. Just as the game entered second-half stoppage time, the referee penalised Romain Vincelot for pulling John Lundstram's shirt, and Maguire curled in the free-kick for his seventh goal of the season.

The first minister said images of Aylan Kurdi being carried from the sea had "touched our hearts". Ms Sturgeon is to convene a migrant crisis summit on Friday with councils and humanitarian agencies. Prime Minister David Cameron has come under increasing pressure for Britain to accept more refugees. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is among those who have urged Mr Cameron to do more to tackle the refugee crisis in Europe. But Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said accepting more refugees was not the answer. Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said: "As first minister I pledge that I will ensure Scotland will do everything possible to help in this refugee crisis. "I will be far from the only person reduced to tears last night at the picture of a little boy washed up on a beach. "That wee boy has touched our hearts but his is not an isolated tragedy. "He and thousands like him whose lives are at risk is not someone else's responsibly; they are the responsibility of all of us. "So yes I am angry, I am very angry at the walk-on-by attitude of the UK government and I implore David Cameron to change his position and change it today. "I pledge as first minister of this country that we stand ready to offer sanctuary to refugees that need our help." Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also criticised Mr Cameron's response to the crisis. She urged the first minister to "convene an urgent meeting with Scotland's council leaders, party leaders and people in this parliament and other relevant government agencies so that Scotland can speak with one voice and match our compassion with the action we are all willing to take". Ms Sturgeon said she had already set up a summit, which will bring together humanitarian organisations, including the Scottish Refugee Council, leaders of councils, civic organisations and religious leaders. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he would accept the invitation to attend the summit. Ms Davidson said the UK government must act "closer to home" and go beyond donating aid to Syria, adding: "This is not an immigration issue - it's a humanitarian crisis." She added: "I call on David Cameron to lead our government's response and accept more refugees."	Nicola Sturgeon has told how she was reduced to tears by photos of a dead Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach.
The bodies were found on Sunday, but no identities have been released. Two people have been reported missing from a sushi restaurant hit by the blast: Nicholas Figueroa, who was on a date there, and a worker, Moises Lucon. A further 22 people were injured in the explosion and subsequent fire, four critically. Utility inspectors had declared plumbing and gas work inside one of the buildings faulty just an hour before the explosion, locking the line to ensure it would not be used and then leaving, officials said. The blast that followed soon after left heaps of bricks and mangled debris across the street in Manhattan's East Village. Mr Figueroa's date, who is being treated in hospital, remembers only stumbling out of the restaurant before losing consciousness. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said officials would investigate whether anyone had improperly tapped the gas supply prior to the blast.	Two bodies been found at the site of a massive gas explosion that flattened three buildings in New York on Thursday.
The Invergordon lifeboat was launched and local coastguards teams deployed at about 14:30. As they headed to the scene it was reported that the dinghy had come to rest on a sandbank. The local coastguards on the ground were able to reach the inflatable vessel and help the occupants to safety. Invergordon Lifeboat spokesman Michael MacDonald said: "They were lucky to come to rest on a sandbank. "If the wind had picked up it could have been blown them further out with the tide also on it's way out and they could have been put in more danger."	Two adults and a child were rescued by coastguard teams after their dinghy was blown offshore near Nairn East beach.
Firefighters were called to a home in Marlborough Road just after 22:00 GMT on Saturday after a fire developed in the first floor and roof. A man was removed from the home by firefighters, but later died in hospital. The cause of the fire is being investigated by Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Thames Valley Police.	A man has been killed in a fire in Oxford.
The plans would allow victims to ask for a case to be reviewed when police identified a suspect but did not pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. The policy would begin with rape and child sexual exploitation cases. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was time to "put victims in the driving seat". The CPS already has a right to review scheme in place, where victims can request a review of their case if it is dropped by prosecutors before reaching the courtroom. Labour said it intended to extend this to decisions by the police. Ms Cooper said: "Rape and child sexual exploitation are vile crimes that ruin lives and destroy families. "Too often victims and survivors aren't listened to and aren't heard, especially children. "And although reports to the police have gone up, arrests and prosecutions have gone down. "But right now if the police decide not to pursue a crime, there is little more victims or their families can do. That's not good enough. "We'll change the law so that if the police decide to drop a case after a suspect has been identified, victims will have a new right to challenge their decision. "It's time to change the culture, stop these awful crimes being hidden away and put victims in the driving seat." Main pledges Labour said that of 16,300 complaints of rape made to the police in England and Wales in 2012-13, 5,400 were passed to the CPS. The party said a decision to drop a case when a suspect had been identified would follow the process used by the CPS, of local resolution followed by independent review. Under the plans, the decision to drop the case would be first be checked by a prosecutor who has not been involved with the case previously. Labour said it would ensure victims were provided with a clear and detailed explanation of the decision and the local resolution would normally be completed within 10 days of the receipt of a request for review. If the victim were not satisfied with the local resolution, the decision would be independently reviewed by another prosecutor. Former Thames Valley Chief Constable and head of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: "It is critical that victims have a right to review decisions all the way from the duty to record and allegation, through to decisions on whether to pursue a prosecution. "Not only does this put the spotlight of accountability on the police, but it also gives the victim an important additional opportunity to influence their case and understand the decisions. "Sometimes this will encourage a fresh angle to the case; sometimes there will be no new avenues. But there should always be a full and frank explanation of the steps taken to bring an offender to justice and the rationale for police decision."	Labour has said it would give victims of sexual offences the right to challenge decisions by police not to prosecute suspects.
Some operations have been cancelled and extra staff drafted in to deal with a surge of patients over the weekend. The Bristol Royal Infirmary, Southmead Hospital and Weston General hospitals are affected. More beds are being opened but people are urged not to go to A&E unless they have a "life-threatening" condition. Instead they are urged to go to minor injury units, chemists and GP surgeries, or to call the NHS on 111. A black alert, the highest level, means hospital services are unable to cope with demand. The three hospitals were last on black alert earlier this month. The number of people in hospital for more than two weeks is much higher than usual, said an NHS spokesman. A surge of patients during last week's cold snap has added to pressure. The black alert is likely to stay in place for days. Extra ambulance staff are being used to transfer patients into hospital, to prevent ambulances queuing and district nurses are being deployed to hospitals, to help find community beds for patients well enough to leave. Bristol GP Peter Goyder said an increase in hospital admissions together with "a higher number of very ill patients who need to stay in hospital for longer" had contributed to the situation. Analysis of the most recent figures suggests hospitals in England are struggling to meet the four-hour target for treating or admitting 95% of patients. Three hospitals in Cornwall also went on black alert this month, as did two in Somerset.	Hospitals with A&E departments around Bristol are back on black alert for the second time in a month amid "severe pressure" on services.

The former Manchester United, Newcastle and Blackburn forward suffered kidney failure in 2015 after contracting an airborne virus. He has just returned to his role as a United ambassador following surgery. The 45-year-old is not even allowed to fly to Barcelona for a Manchester United legends game on 30 June. Cole said: "It is a long road ahead. It is a tough road and different to the battles I have had before. "It is not like getting a football injury, when you go to the gym and work a bit harder." His 28-year-old nephew Alexander provided the donor kidney - "a noble job" as Cole described it. Cole has improved physically and has lost most of the weight he gained through his illness. And while there is still more work to do, Cole, who will be United's assistant manager for the return legends game against Barcelona at Old Trafford on 2 September, is looking forward to playing if a similar match is staged in 2018. He said: "I still get very tired but I can do a lot more than I was able to two years ago. If this game is played next year I want to be out there." Earlier this week, another former Newcastle and England striker, Alan Shearer, told the BBC he felt English clubs were a long way off being able to challenge for the Champions League. Cole agrees, saying: "From what I have seen in Europe, I am not sure any of the English teams will win it. They are miles apart. "If you look at Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich, a lot of the players people are talking about Premier League clubs paying £50m or £60m for can't get in their teams. "That tells you where they are at."	Former England striker Andy Cole says he faces a "long road ahead" as he recovers from his recent kidney transplant.
Jaz Oberoi, from Hanwell in west London, said he was "accommodating" with police when they found the wires to be a headphone lead, but found being questioned a second time "unnecessary". His train was held for 30 minutes on Friday evening while he was questioned. Police said the matter was "concluded". Mr Oberoi said: "They explained to me someone had put in a complaint there's an Asian man with a backpack with a wire hanging out of his bag. "They saw pretty quickly it was a headphone cable - I understood they were just doing their job." He said he was allowed back on the Paddington-bound train, only to be removed again for further questioning. "To be marched off twice was a bit much - I wasn't rude, I was very accommodating. I felt it was completely unnecessary to humiliate me twice," Mr Oberoi said. Thames Valley Police said its officers had supported British Transport Police after "concerns were raised about a group of passengers". "The incident has now been concluded as far as Thames Valley Police involvement and no arrests have been made," a spokesman said.	A rail traveller has spoken of his "humiliation" after being twice detained by armed police at Reading station over concerns about wires seen in his pocket.
Sally Shalloe, 51, of Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, died when her bicycle was hit by David Staley's motorbike in Middleton Boulevard in April last year. At Nottingham Crown Court, Staley, 32, admitted causing Ms Shalloe's death by dangerous driving. Staley, of Arnold, Nottingham, is due to be sentenced on 13 May. Ms Shalloe worked as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, and husband Jim Hill said his wife previously produced studies on road safety. "She was cycling to work that morning," said Mr Hill, who had been married to Ms Shalloe for 16 years. "I had a policewoman walk into my work office and tell me she'd been killed. It was like being split in two with an axe. "It's turned my life upside down completely. I've got a constant feeling of loss." Staley was disqualified from the roads before being bailed ahead of his sentencing.	A motorcyclist has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a former road safety worker who was killed in a crash on a busy Nottingham road.
Visitors are being offered hot drinks, pastries, calligraphy demonstrations and discussion during the "open-house" weekend. The country's leading Muslim body, the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), seeks to distance mainstream Islam from recent jihadist attacks. The initiative comes a year after the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris. Jihadist gunmen killed 17 people at different Paris sites, including the offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket. Marking the anniversary of the killings, President Francois Hollande unveiled a plaque on Saturday in tribute to one of those who died, policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe. France also remembered the four Jewish hostages killed at the supermarket. France is still under a state of emergency after November's Paris attacks, carried out by gunmen linked to the Islamic State group, which killed 130 people. Hundreds of French mosques are taking part in the open-house event, dubbed a "brotherly cup of tea". "The objective is to create a space where people can be together and meet normal Muslim worshippers and all of our fellow citizens," CFCM President Anouar Kbibech told AFP. He said the CFCM wanted to use the anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attacks to "highlight the real values of Islam, to set straight the cliches about links to violence and terrorism".	French mosques have invited non-Muslims in to try to create greater understanding of Islam in France.
So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now? What is the bank levy? It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that: Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May. The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January. What's it for? The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous. The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government. So will this help deal with the budget deficit? The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in £2.6bn every year. That's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year. It's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five. What's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage? Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies. But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets. Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again. A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days. When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts. This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend. Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock. But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits. In the UK, the first £85,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be £35,000 before the financial crisis). This means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn. So why not just insure all the banks' borrowings? The bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme. The IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises. However, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them. If the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow. The government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland. Indeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis. Some might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme. By making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending. Why is the first £20bn of debts exempt from the tax? The government wants to encourage banks to shrink. The thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not. The £20bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that. Why is the tax rate lower on long-term debts? Longer-term debts are inherently less risky. Financial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months. If a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis. Will the levy really discourage banks? The tax will increase the cost of "risky" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point. This may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income. However, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate). But to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis. Why did the government want to phase the levy in? The original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March). The government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question. They also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly. The banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators. So why did the government change its mind? In February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full £2.6bn this year after all. It pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks. Moreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards. It probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago. And markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011. Why is the government raising the rate again? The chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement. According to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the £2.6bn originally planned for this year. The Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax. It could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax. And all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements. Which banks will have to pay most? The Treasury does not say how much of its £2.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank. British banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK. That has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill. Moreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest. It may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake. But one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.	The government says it will increase the levy on banks from 0.078% to 0.088% from 1 January.
Ibrahim Halawa, the son of the most senior Muslim cleric in the Republic of Ireland, was arrested during a siege on the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo in 2013. The mass trial of Mr Halawa and 493 others began in March after being postponed five times since his arrest. Mr Halawa, 19, could face the death penalty if he is convicted. Mr Halawa was on a family holiday to his parents' homeland when he and three of his sisters were arrested by Egyptian security forces during a crackdown on protests in the country's capital. He was 17 at the time. His family said he had taken refuge in the building during violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi and the security forces. His sisters were allowed to return to Dublin in November 2013. On Wednesday, a hearing in his case took place, with Irish officials in attendance. But it could not proceed as 16 defendants were not present in court, according to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. Defence lawyers requested that the trial would not proceed during the forthcoming Ramadan period and the judge agreed to adjourn the matter until 2 August, the department added. Amnesty International Ireland said Mr Halawa should be released immediately with all charges against him dropped. Colm O'Gorman, the human rights organisation's executive director in Ireland, said the situation was "utterly unacceptable". "No one should have to withstand the continual raising of hope that they might have their day in court, only to have that hope continually dashed," he said. "This young man should be at home in Ireland, continuing his studies and getting on with his life." He added: "I urge the Irish government and their EU partners to continue to work on Ibrahim's case as an absolute priority."	The trial of a Dublin teenager held in an Egyptian prison for almost two years has been adjourned for a third time.
The firm has reported a net profit of $471m (Â£294m) in the three months to 8 September. China contributed more than half of Yum's $3.6bn revenue during the period. US-based Yum is the biggest Western restaurant operator in China and fears about growth in the country had pushed Yum shares lower in recent weeks. Profits in Yum's Chinese business had dropped in the second quarter because of higher costs but rebounded in the third quarter, rising by 22%. Since June, the group has opened 394 new restaurants, of which 192 new units were in China, which contributed to its sales growth. Globally, profits for the group grew 18% during the period. The company beat its earnings targets and has raised its full-year outlook.	Yum Brands, which runs the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant chains, has seen third quarter profits soar 23%, boosted by strong sales in China.
A senior executive at the Wall Street giant, Daniel Pinto, said that "hundreds" of staff may move to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. However, it is understood that the number of people who would be relocated involves between 500 and 1,000 jobs. Earlier, Standard Chartered bank said it was in talks with German regulators about making Frankfurt its Europe base. However, Standard said the impact on UK staff would be "minimal". Several global banks have announced in recent weeks that they will move some jobs out of London as part of contingency plans for when the UK leaves the EU. Speaking to Bloomberg News, Mr Pinto, head of investment banking at JP Morgan, said: "We are going to use the three banks we already have in Europe as the anchors for our operations. "We will have to move hundreds of people in the short term to be ready for day one, when negotiations finish, and then we will look at the longer-term numbers." JP Morgan's main offices in continental Europe are in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, but it also has operations in Paris, Milan, Madrid and Stockholm. JP Morgan is widely reported to be in talks to buy a Dublin office big enough to hold more than 1,000 workers. Since the Brexit referendum last year, European cities have lined up to try and woo financial services companies to move operations there to continue serving European clients. Standard Chartered chairman Jose Vinals said on Wednesday: "We are looking at setting up a subsidiary in the EU to ensure we are prepared. "The choice of Frankfurt is very natural as we have a branch there and we do euro clearing there." However, a spokeswoman for the bank, which only has a small amount of business in Europe, said the impact on UK staff would be "minimal". Other financial services companies have announced plans to move workers out of London in case the UK fails to secure "passporting" rights for them to operate across EU borders after Brexit. Deutsche Bank said last week it could move up to 4,000 jobs out of the UK as a result of Brexit - nearly half its UK workforce. Barclays told the BBC the bank was preparing to add hundreds of staff to offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Milan to counter Brexit risks to its European business. Goldman Sachs has confirmed it will move jobs away from London and bulk up its European presence by "hundreds of people" before a Brexit deal is struck. Insurers Lloyd's of London and Royal London are also setting up subsidiaries outside the UK. JP Morgan's Mr Pinto told Bloomberg: "We have to plan for a scenario where there is no UK-EU passporting deal, and we have to move a substantial portion of our business to continue serving our European clients. "We'll have to wait to see what kind of deal can be achieved and see what we need to do from there." He was speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Saudi Arabia. A JP Morgan spokesman confirmed Mr Pinto's remarks, but did not elaborate on the story. A report commissioned by the City UK industry group warned in October that as many as 75,000 financial services jobs could be lost from London if operations into the EU are severely disrupted after Brexit.	US bank JP Morgan could move up to 1,000 jobs out of London ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union.
Hamdi Alqudsi, 42, was found guilty of violating Australia's foreign incursion laws for making travel arrangements for a group of would-be jihadists in 2013. Giving evidence for the first time at a sentence hearing, he expressed regret and said that he loved Australia. Alqudsi also claimed he thought that IS would help civilians. He faces a maximum 10 years in jail for seven counts of providing services with the intention of supporting hostile acts. "As an Australian I should have minded my own business," Alqudsi told the New South Wales Supreme Court. "I love Australia, I always have." On Wednesday, Alqudsi admitted for the first time that he knew the seven men he assisted in 2013 planned to take up arms against Syrian government forces. He said he should have limited his involvement to taking donations for Syrian civilians trough registered charity groups. Alqudsi broke down in tears while giving evidence, saying he now realises he was breaking the law. "At the time, I felt it was the right thing to do," he said. "I am really, really sorry for what I have done." Two of the seven men Alqudsi helped were killed in Syria. Two others have returned to Australia, another was arrested before he could leave the country, and the fate of two other men is unknown. Alqudsi said his first impression of the Islamic State group was that they were a force for good. The prosecutor put it to him that it was obvious the men intended to travel to Syria to fight. "You knew these men were going to be out in the fields of Syria engaging in warfare," David Staehli SC said. "Yes, I did," Alqudsi replied.	A Sydney man who helped seven young men travel from Australia to Syria to join the Islamic State conflict has told a court he is "not a terrorist".
The 28-year-old footballer's contract was terminated hours after he was dropped for Saturday's Premier League match against Manchester United. He will stand trial on Friday on two further counts of sexual activity with a child, which he denies. Sportswear firm Adidas has cancelled its contract with the midfielder. After Johnson's arrest in March 2015, the club suspended him, but then lifted the ban following talks with his representatives and the Professional Footballers' Association. In his last appearance for the Black Cats, England international Johnson - who played while on bail - scored in a 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield. Johnson, who was born in Sunderland, began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then to Sunderland for £10m in 2012. When asked about the winger's future at a news conference earlier on Thursday, Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce said: "He'll not be available for this weekend. We will see how it goes after that." The trial of Johnson, who has won 12 England caps, will take place at Bradford Crown Court and is expected to last two weeks.	Adam Johnson has been sacked by Sunderland after pleading guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.
Louis Kayes, from Moodiesburn in North Lanarkshire, called the club to tell them he was sorry he had not made it to Saturday's game against Motherwell. The boy's mother, 35-year-old Lisa Kayes, said he had borrowed her phone to make the call. She told the BBC her son had called after a "bit of a guilt trip". Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme, she said: "He was in the living room with my phone and then I heard the voicemail message from Celtic Park saying 'thank you for calling'." Ms Kayes said Louis wanted to speak to the club's manager, Brendan Rodgers, and his favourite player, Celtic captain Scott Brown, to apologise and explain his absence. "He wanted to let both of them know he'd missed it in case they were looking for him," she said. Louis told BBC Scotland the birthday party had been "good", but said he would definitely not be missing Wednesday evening's Champions League clash with Borussia Monchengladbach. He predicted a 3-1 victory for his club, but confessed to feeling some pre-match nerves. Ms Kayes added: "He's possibly the most passionate five-year-old I know in terms of supporting Celtic. He doesn't like to miss a game. "I think Celtic-Motherwell is the last home game he'll miss in a while. I don't think we'll be getting him to many other things on a Saturday afternoon."	A five-year-old Celtic fan rang the club to apologise for missing a game after it clashed with a friend's birthday party.
Wilson was airlifted to hospital from the Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania after Sage Karam's car spun and crashed in front of him on lap 179 of 200. Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a "monumentally sad day". Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman & Co, said: "Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. "As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time." A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a "loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers". His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: "Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. "He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved." An Andretti Autosport team statement said: "He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. "His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none." Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised £1.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. "I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious," he tweeted. "The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family." World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: "I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him." Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: "Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. "Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock." Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: "Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend." Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: "Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones." Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. "I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family," he said on social media.	British driver Justin Wilson has died after being struck by flying debris and suffering a serious head injury in Sunday's Pocono IndyCar 500 race.
With a fifth successive title win all but wrapped up, the PFA Scotland Player of the Year says thoughts are now turning to defending the crown next season. "We're fired up again for next year," Griffiths said. "We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six." Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign. "As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special," said the Celtic striker. "I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it." Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading. Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support. Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign. "We were disappointing," admits Griffiths. "The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery." "{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing." The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer. Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic. "Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate," said the Scotland international. "There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad. "I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan." The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland. "As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us. "Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year." Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend. "The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday. "We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us." Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September. "I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn. "We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man."	Leigh Griffiths says Celtic are "fired up" for next season as they aim to win a sixth straight Premiership title.
Sarries will begin the defence of their domestic title against Worcester in the London Double Header at Twickenham on Saturday, 3 September. Barritt told BBC Radio London: "Last year was probably the most successful season in the club's history. "But we now have a fresh page to write a new chapter in the Saracens story." England centre Barritt, 29, played a key role in Saracens' momentous campaign, which culminated in their 28-20 victory over Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership final at Twickenham on 28 May. Two weeks earlier, they were crowned European champions after beating Racing 92 in Lyon, becoming the first team in the competition's history to win all nine games in the tournament on their way to picking up the trophy. However, Barritt believes they could face an even tougher challenge next time around. "This Premiership shows you that anyone can beat anyone on their day. You can't be fooled into any false sense of safety that it's just going to happen," he said. "The Premiership is the most competitive domestic league in the world. There's quality throughout and every team brings equal and different challenges." Barritt also said the "continuity of the squad" - of which eight were part of England's Six Nations-winning squad earlier this year - has been "a huge key" in their success. "We've been a very settled squad who understand each other, who've played together for a certain amount of time, and that's allowed those bonds to grow," Barritt added. "You can see by the intensity of training and the focus in the players' minds that the guys are very eager to make it another successful year." Meanwhile, Saracens are learning from the success of Australian Football League club Hawthorn Hawks as they seek to deliver another trophy-laden season. Hawthorn have won the last three AFL Championships and sit top of the table as they bid for an historic fourth in a row. "We've looked specifically at the Hawthorn Hawks in the AFL, who are [aiming for] a fourth championship in a row," Barritt told BBC Radio 5 live. "It's about the relentlessness of the organisation. It's about an organisation being hungry and being as driven as they have ever been, as if it's their first championship. "We are back-to-back Premiership champions and (now) European champions. We know those things don't come easily, and we know the next season is going to be that much harder because you are going to have a target on your back."	Premiership and European Champions Cup winners Saracens are determined to be even stronger next season, says skipper Brad Barritt.
The information minister said the move was to mourn the revolutionary leader, who died on Friday at the age of 90. Cuba was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with The Gambia after Mr Jammeh took power in a coup in 1994. Mr Jammeh, 51, is seeking re-election for a fifth term in office. For the first time since he came to power he will be facing a single major opposition candidate. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch accused him of using violence to silence critics ahead of the 1 December poll and said two activists had died in custody and dozens of people had been jailed and denied medical or legal help. Mr Jammeh had strong links with Castro, with the Cuban leader sending doctors to work in The Gambia.	Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh has suspended his campaign for Thursday's election as a mark of respect for Cuba's Fidel Castro.
The judge in Brooklyn denied a motion by the US Justice Department to get Apple to unlock a phone in a drug case. In an unrelated case, the FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December. But Apple has resisted, calling that demand "dangerous" and "unprecedented". The ruling in Brooklyn on Monday centres on the same point as the San Bernardino case. The two court cases are not linked - the magistrate in San Bernardino doesn't have to pay any attention to the ruling and remarks from the New York judge. But Apple feels the decision in New York gives added strength to its position. A senior Apple spokesman told reporters in a conference call that he was confident the San Bernardino judge would carefully analyse the New York ruling. Most promising for Apple is the reason for which Judge Orenstein threw out the New York case. He said he was not at all convinced the All Writs Act, a law more than two centuries old, could be used to force Apple to comply. The same law is being used in San Bernardino. The All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here. No legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant. Apple v the FBI - a plain English guide Apple's boss hits back at FBI conduct Bill Gates calls for terror data debate Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December. A court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was "an overreach by the US government" and risked giving authorities "the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data". Last week, the company asked a court to overturn the ruling. The same Act from 1789 that was used by the FBI in the San Bernardino request was applied in the Brooklyn case. But Judge James Orenstein said the Act was not applicable in this case, adding that it was not right to impose "on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will". The US Justice Department said it planned to appeal against the Brooklyn ruling.	A judge in the United States has ruled that Apple cannot be forced to give the FBI access to a locked iPhone in a case that echoes an ongoing legal battle.
BBC Wales Sport understands the Gills made an enquiry for Byrne, before Edinburgh changed his mind over a player he brought to Rodney Parade. Edinburgh opted to end the pursuit out of respect for his old club, who he managed from 2011-2015, so as not to weaken their battle against relegation. They are currently 20th in League Two, seven points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Newport have confirmed the release of defender Matt Taylor. The 34-year old joined from Cheltenham in the summer but made just five appearances for the south Wales club. "Further to recent discussions, we can confirm that Matt Taylor will leave the Club with immediate effect having mutually agreed to terminate his contract," a statement from the club read. Taylor is understood to be a target for Torquay United.	Newport midfielder Mark Byrne was a transfer target for Gillingham before a U-turn from manager Justin Edinburgh.
Demolition of the existing buildings is still subject to a bat mitigation licence being granted by Natural England. Commercial Estates Group (CEG) was granted permission in 2011 to redevelop in Carlyon Bay. The Â£250m redevelopment project would include housing and leisure facilities. The site, near St Austell, was previously home to the Cornwall Coliseum complex, which hosted acts such as Cliff Richard, Status Quo and The Who. CEG development director John Kenny said the company was planning a "major development which will have major benefits", including providing more than 400 construction jobs and 500 jobs after completion.	Designs for a new development on the site of the old Cornwall Coliseum building at Carlyon Bay have been approved by Cornwall Council.
The specialist, Dr Howard Kornfeld, was unable to make it from California to Minnesota immediately but sent his son. In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer. The Kornfelds' lawyer said neither had met Prince before his death. William Mauzy told reporters on Wednesday that Prince's team contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld on 20 April, the day before Prince died. Unable to make it to Minnesota, the doctor dispatched his son and called a local doctor, who cleared his morning schedule but never saw the singer. When Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived at Prince's Paisley Park home, he was told that the singer was missing. He joined members of staff to search the property and made the emergency call when Prince's unresponsive body was found. Mr Mauzy said the plan was to stabilise him in Minnesota, before flying him to California to seek treatment at Dr Kornfeld's Recovery Without Walls rehab centre in Mill Valley. The lawyer confirmed that Andrew Kornfeld had been interviewed by police, but was protected by Minnesota's Good Samaritan law. The law offers some legal protections to those who make emergency calls, to encourage them to do so. No details have been released from Prince's autopsy exam, but investigators are looking into whether he died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death. They are also trying to establish whether a doctor was on the singer's plane when it made an emergency landing less than a week before he died. The musician was found unconscious on the plane after it stopped in Moline, Illinois, on 15 April. Detectives investigating his death have asked to see fire and ambulance records related to the emergency landing. It emerged on Wednesday that emergency calls were made from the Paisley Park complex 46 times in the past five years. A log released by Minnesota authorities showed the 911 calls related to everything from medical emergencies to false fire alarms. It included one call in 2011 in which an unidentified woman said she was concerned about Prince's cocaine use, but no police action was taken.	Prince's team requested emergency support from a leading addiction specialist just a day before the singer died, the doctor's lawyer has revealed.
The woman, believed to be Lithuanian, was struck by a car on the A38 near Burton-upon-Trent around 20:30 BST on 6 July after leaving the man's vehicle. Johnathon Allison, of Colman Street, Hull, has also been arrested on suspicion of murder. Mr Allison was remanded in custody at Cannock Magistrates' Court on 8 July. See more stories from Stoke and Staffordshire here Staffordshire Police said Mr Allison has been released under investigation in connection with the murder probe. He will next appear at Stafford Crown Court on 11 August. Police said the woman left the vehicle as it pulled into a layby, and was hit at "high speed" by an oncoming car. She was airlifted to hospital in cardiac arrest with head, chest and pelvic injuries, but later died. Police are now working with authorities in Lithuania to confirm the identity of the woman.	A man has appeared in court charged with breaching a restraining order following the death of a woman on a dual carriageway.
Neville is still waiting for a first league win since taking charge of Valencia in December. Former Barcelona B striker Sanabria, on loan from Roma, scored his fourth goal in two games after Danilo tripped Jony. Alvaro Negredo missed three chances to equalise, heading one against the post, then chipping wide and blazing over. Valencia, previously unbeaten at home in the league, then missed another great chance as Rodrigo Moreno and Sofiane Feghouli narrowly failed to connect with Zakaria Bakkali's left-wing cross. At the other end, Australian goalkeeper Matty Ryan was fortunate not to concede a second penalty after barging into Carlos Carmona. Valencia have not won any of the eight La Liga matches since former Manchester United and England defender Neville took charge and have gone a total of 11 league matches without a win, two short of equalling a club record. Neville must attempt to lift his side in time for Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final first leg against Barcelona at the Nou Camp.	Gary Neville's Valencia were booed by their own supporters after Antonio Sanabria's penalty eased Sporting Gijon's relegation worries.
Police said the attackers - three white men and one Asian man - were racially motivated. The victims were black. Protesters have been gathered since 25-year-old Jamar Clark was shot during a struggle with police on 15 November. People who claimed to witness the incident said that Clark was handcuffed, though police dispute this. Around two dozen tents and canopy shelters have been erected around the 4th Precinct police station. Demonstrators have also barricaded the roads with wood and pallets and lit campfires. According to criminal complaints, the four men went to the camp on 23 November. After a group of protesters attempted to escort them away, eight shots were heard. The city's mayor, Betsy Hodges, said the camp has become unsafe and has asked people to disband their week-long protest. These request have been rejected by protesters, who have vowed to continue camping out despite cold weather and attacks. One of the shooting victims, Wesley Martin, said they refuse to leave. "They can have the street. We can take the sidewalk," said Martin. "To be honest, we're not going nowhere."	Four men have been charged in a shooting at outside a Minneapolis police station that left five protesters wounded.
With colleagues in BBC News, we have been tracking where the party leaders are going. And, frankly, the Conservative game plan seems extremely straightforward. To illustrate that, here is a chart: each block represents a Tory-facing Labour seat (in red) or a Labour-facing Tory seat (in blue). And each stack of blocks tells you how many seats each party gains if they improve their polling, in 2 percentage points increments. So, for example, the red stack left of the centre line is nine high. If the Tories were to uniformly poll 2 percentage points higher on election day than they did in 2015 relative to Labour, they would take nine seats. Conversely, a two-point improvement for Labour relative to the Tories would yield 12 seats. Of course, at the moment, the Conservatives are well ahead of where they were at the last general election, while Labour are doing much the same. Political scientist Dr Chris Hanretty from the University of East Anglia estimates the likely result is for the Conservatives to take seats, roughly as follows. That dark blue zone is the area where, according to Dr Hanretty's maths, about 70 seats are now likely to go Conservative, having been Labour seats in 2015. Those seats - and seats like them - are the front line in this election. We can overlay that graph with black blocks that show the sort of places where Theresa May has visited. What does this mean? Well, Mrs May is spending the bulk of her time in front line seats. She made one visit to Maidenhead, her own seat, which is the block to the far right. But it is very clear where she thinks the fight is - and it is roughly where Dr Hanretty thinks it is. There is, though, a subtler game being played. We do not talk much about the importance to campaigns of getting on local TV and radio bulletins, which have huge audiences and credibility. But parties obsess over it. More people tune into BBC One's regional news bulletins at 6:30pm than the national news at 6pm. You could divide the country into BBC radio or TV regions to illustrate this. But here, for example, are the number of days in which Mrs May has made a visit to each ITV region or sub-region. That emphasis on the West Midlands and Yorkshire is telling: 28 of the seats that Dr Hanretty currently expects to flip are in those two areas. This way of thinking may also clarify things for some activists who were puzzled as to why Theresa May went campaigning in rural Aberdeenshire. It put her into STV North, which covers a few target seats currently held by the SNP. And note, she only has one region yet to reach. Mr Corbyn's visits, though, are harder to make sense of. Reproducing the same charts, you can see few of his visits have been into the seats that polling currently implies will change hands. On this chart, the black blocks represent his campaign trips. Of the battleground seats, Mr Corbyn has been to three. Mr Corbyn is holding events in safe Labour seats and in Tory seats which, the polls suggest, are very unlikely to be won.  But he is not doing much in the zone in between, where seats are most likely to change hands. Why? The simplest answer is that Mr Corbyn's team simply think the polls are wrong. They think the Tory seats he's going to are going to go red - and the Tories are wasting their time fighting in seats that will stay with Labour. We will see. A less simple answer is that his campaign has chosen not to take him to the front line. Several Labour MPs in those seats have made it clear that they think his presence will not help them persuade swing voters. This pattern has been noticed by some of his critics who wonder if this is about life after 8 June. Mr Corbyn, some Labour insiders say, is visiting safe seats where Labour activists are over-represented to bolster his place in the next Labour leadership race. Two Labour MPs suggested to me he is trying to maximise the popular Labour vote to help bolster his argument for staying on in the event of a defeat. Broadcasting, though, is a factor to consider in all this. ITV audiences in target seats may not notice exactly where he is. Mr Corbyn has been getting into the TV regions - and it is possible he is generating better pictures, addressing big crowds, by visiting safer Labour seats. Whatever the rationale, the only thing that's utterly clear is that Mrs May and Mr Corbyn aren't fighting this election in the same way. Additional work by Jack Evans and Daniel Dunford	One of the most striking factors about this election campaign is that Labour and the Conservative Party appear to be running two entirely unconnected election campaigns.
Russell Goodway told BBC Radio Wales that councillors and officials were the "experts" and should "seriously develop" a set of proposals. Former Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews had been planning to cut the 22 councils to eight or nine. But First Minister Carwyn Jones has said the Welsh Government will have to rethink its plans to win wider support. Mr Andrews is no longer in government after losing his Rhondda seat at the election in May, and the Labour manifesto did not include a commitment on the number of councils it would like to see. As a minority government, Labour will need the support of other parties if any cut is to happen. Speaking on the Good Morning Wales programme on Monday, Mr Goodway said: "The status quo isn't an option. "You really cannot maintain 22 local authorities unless you're prepared to dismantle local government as we know it and create other organisations or bodies that would be responsible for some of the major services such as education, social services and possibly economic development. "I would like to see the experts in the field, who happen to be those that run local authorities - whether they're councillors or council officials - coming forward with well-developed proposals to meet the government's aims. "I do not want to see a top-down reorganisation imposed on Welsh local government, particularly at a time when you're seeing a lot of new faces in the assembly, people who don't have the expertise in local government to shape those services. "I really do hope now the Welsh Local Government Association and the leaders in local government will come forward and seriously develop a set of proposals, hopefully capturing the city region dimension." On Sunday, the first minister told BBC Radio Wales he wanted to talk to opposition parties about the future of local government. "Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious," Mr Jones told the Sunday Supplement programme. Meanwhile trade unions representing council workers have asked for urgent talks on the issue with the new finance and local government secretary Mark Drakeford. Dominic MacAskill, head of local government in Wales for Unison, said: "We are in a state of limbo and, in that state of limbo, the workforce is anxious and fearful of the future."	Councils should draw up fresh plans to reorganise local government, a former leader of Cardiff council has said.
Comparisons will inevitably be made with the legendary centre and former Irish captain. After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? "He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid," says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. "Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. "Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. "Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving." Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: "I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. "He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. "He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. "He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his discipline on and off the pitch is great. He has all the things that you need to succeed." Former Ireland international backs Tony Ward and Jonny Bell are excited about what impact Ringrose can have on this year's Six Nations. Ward, who starred in a famous Munster win over New Zealand in 1978, says: "He showed us his mental strength in that Australia game last autumn. "With Robbie Henshaw injured and when Jared Payne came off, he went from being the third or fourth choice to a guy at the top of the heap. "He really stepped up and I just think he is an amazing talent. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations." Ulster man Bell knows a thing or two about spotting talent. A decorated centre himself, he's now one of the coaches at Gloucester. Again, comparisons with other Irish 13s were impossible to avoid. "Everyone keeps likening him to Brian O'Driscoll. He can find space, he's elusive and can break tackles. "He has good leg drive. At this level, you have to have ability. To work against these hard defensive systems, you must have that innate natural ability, and Garry has that in droves." According to Bell, Ringrose definitely has the ability and mental strength to succeed, but those qualities need to be complemented by hard work. "He has a very diligent approach, and that is very important in the modern game," adds Bell. "If you look at the likes of Danny Cipriani, he had amazing ability but he hasn't really produced what he is capable of. He's done well, but not hit the heights he maybe could have because of outside distractions." By all accounts, Ringrose has the right mix to succeed at the very top level. If he keeps improving, that step up from first class to world class will seem to be a 'when' rather than an 'if'. Let's leave the last word to Girvan Dempsey who won 82 Ireland caps between 1998 and 2008 and is now Leinster's backs coach. "Dealing with him right from the off, even from 17, you could tell he was rugby-smart. He just got it," said former full-back Dempsey. "He just bounces onto the training field. And we're just constantly looking forward to seeing what's going to come next. "Garry loves expressing himself, and certainly we'd never, ever want to curb that in any way because it's so refreshing. "Hopefully he'll just keep getting better and better as time goes on."	Garry Ringrose has never played in the Six Nations before - but he's already being hailed as Ireland's best prospect since Brian O'Driscoll.
The move is in response to an £8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. "Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy," he said. "Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. "The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills." Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. "The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant," he said. "It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. "If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff." Just under £100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many.	Queen's University Belfast is cutting 236 jobs and 290 student places due to a funding reduction.
Yvonne Mosquito, the West Midlands Deputy PCC, was suspended after visiting a murder victim's family without informing officers. Following a disciplinary in May 2016, Ms Mosquito had an employment tribunal listed to take place in May 2017. A joint statement said "all outstanding matters" were resolved. A BBC source said Ms Mosquito had received a payout. The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner said it would not comment on whether money had exchanged hands. Allegations against Ms Mosquito related to a visit she paid to the family of Kenichi Phillips, 18, who was shot dead in a car in Birmingham, on 17 March 2016. Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said her actions "caused ongoing upset and distress" and "damaged the relationship" between the family and police "in the middle of a complex and sensitive murder investigation". Her supporters insisted she visited as an ordained minister who wanted to offer condolences to relatives. Her union Unite rejected the allegations, saying it was "deplorable" the hearing went ahead in Ms Mosquito's absence. She was issued with a final written warning and her contract was never renewed. The BBC previously reported Ms Mosquito wrote a letter of complaint about the PCC's behaviour towards her, of which the PCC was aware, four weeks before her suspension. A joint statement issued by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) and Ms Mosquito said they were "happy to announce that they have amicably settled all outstanding matters between them". "Litigation is a stressful business and the parties acknowledge and regret the effects that inevitably follow from that," it added. The former colleagues thanked each other for their work around issues of equality, the statement added.	A row between a Police and Crime Commissioner and his deputy, who was found guilty of serious misconduct, has been resolved following a payout.
The champions paid for a lacklustre first half, where they created clear openings for Jamie Vardy and Robert Huth, but surrendered the ball all too easily. Eddie Howe's side saw 70% of the ball before the break and Marc Pugh scored for the hosts on his first league start of the season with a controlled drive from 18 yards out. Leicester improved but ran into a stubborn home defence and goalkeeper Artur Boruc produced a key save to deny Leonardo Ulloa from six yards in the final minute. Relive Bournemouth's hard-earned win It means Claudio Ranieri's side set an unwanted record as their haul of one point away from home is the lowest total by a defending top-flight champion from the first eight away games of a season. They remain 14th, four points above the bottom three, while the Cherries move to eighth. Boruc's late save followed a key block from Steve Cook to thwart substitute Shinji Okazaki. The two interventions epitomised Bournemouth's resilience and Howe described it as a "heroic" defensive display. His side had conceded nine goals in three games before kick-off, prompting him to call for more solid showings and that is what he got. Good home possession early on killed any momentum Leicester hoped to carry from Saturday's thrilling victory over Manchester City. And Bournemouth's reward for a fifth home win of 2016-17 is to be five points better off than they were at the same stage last season. Pugh added to the positives with an excellent all-round display, showing good technique in keeping a bouncing ball on target for the winner after Benik Afobe's shot was saved. Howe - who refused to set a target of European qualification after the win - described the match winner as "the model professional" for his patience in waiting for his chance start a league fixture. The statistics get uglier for Leicester, who have no back-to-back wins in the league since April. The Foxes have conceded 19 goals on the road, one more than in all 18 away games last season and have managed 21 goals in 16 games - 13 fewer than at the same stage last term. And against Bournemouth they looked one-dimensional going forward. They mustered 12 shots but many of them arrived in a late flurry. Vardy - a hat-trick hero three days earlier - had 26 touches, the same number as Islam Slimani, who was taken off at the break and just six more than Okazaki, who replaced the Algerian. Huth's early volley - deflected wide moments before Pugh's winner - could have significantly changed proceedings but with just 37% possession on the night and only 68% of their passes finding a team-mate, Leicester were not good enough. Their display on the south coast was confused. They were slow from the off and limited in their reaction until it was too late. Ranieri - who has now managed 200 games in the Premier League - will have to find answers. Media playback is not supported on this device Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "It didn't feel anything like routine. It was dramatic playing the champions, we know their qualities and the lads did particularly well. It was a heroic defensive display. I thought we were magnificent in that respect." Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "The result is too severe against us because we created more chances than Bournemouth. I wanted a little more in the first half. A little more and we can score goals, recover more second balls. The second half was much better. If we continue to fight at this level, sooner or later we will get a good result."

The incidents, which occurred overnight between Sunday and Monday, took place in Granton, Boswall, Trinity and Hawthornvale. The cars targeted all had their windows smashed or had attempts made to smash them. About 25 incidents have been reported to police, however there may have been other vehicles damaged. Due to the number of incidents and the scale of the damage, officers are treating the incidents as linked and are appealing for witnesses to come forward. Insp Shane McKenna, of Drylaw Police Station, said: "This is an appalling number of vandalisms and the sheer scale of the damage caused is completely unacceptable. "Not only has a lot of damage and inconvenience been caused to a large number of people, it has also caused a number of police resources in the north of Edinburgh to be diverted in order to investigate. "We are eager to trace those responsible as soon as possible. We would ask that anyone who was in the north Edinburgh area on the evening of Sunday, November 13, and saw this damage take place, to get in touch with us at their earliest convenience."	Police in Edinburgh are investigating after 25 cars were vandalised in one night across the north of the city.
"It is definitely high time for an LGBT character to be included in the Star Trek universe," Zachary Quinto, who plays Mr Spock, told the BBC. "I'm a little stunned there's been so much attention given to it," Chris Pine, the current Captain Kirk, added. George Takei - Sulu in the original Star Trek TV series - described the move last week as "really unfortunate". "I'm delighted that there's a gay character [in the film]," the 79-year-old told the Hollywood Reporter. Yet he claimed the "outing" of Hikaru Sulu was "a twisting" of Gene [Roddenberry]'s creation, "to which he put in so much thought". Takei said Star Trek creator Roddenberry "was a strong supporter of LGBT equality" but had always envisioned Sulu as heterosexual. The actor - who went on to play Sulu in the six Star Trek films made between 1979 and 1991 - announced he was gay in 2005. Speaking on Tuesday before Star Trek Beyond's UK premiere, Simon Pegg said the revelation about Sulu's sexuality "doesn't change George's Sulu in any way". "Whatever he wants that to be, that is how that Sulu is," said the British actor, a cast member and co-writer on the new film. "But in this universe, it felt like a smart way of introducing an aspect of the character we hadn't previously known." In Star Trek Beyond, Enterprise helmsman Sulu is briefly seen being greeted at the end of a voyage by his male partner and daughter. Sulu's partner, whose name is Ben according to the IMDB website, is played in the film by Doug Jung, the film's other co-writer. John Cho, who has played Sulu since the film series was rebooted in 2009, said he had initially been concerned about Takei's reaction. "I was worried because I knew [George] was a gay man who had played a straight character," he told the BBC. "I know he felt a fair bit of ownership of that character, and legitimately so. I was also worried that it might be inferred that we were somehow suggesting that sexuality was a choice. But I don't think anyone has inferred that, and we're certainly not saying that." "It was not something that was flippant," director Justin Lin said. "It was something a lot of thought went into. "George is entitled to his opinion, but at the end of the day I'm the gatekeeper for this and I think it's in the spirit of what Roddenberry wanted." Quinto, who is also openly gay, added: "The LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) community has long advocated for representation in the Star Trek universe. "We've been really excited by the response, particularly from young people, who have been inspired and motivated by this turn toward progress." The decision has also been applauded by Roddenberry's son Rod, who has said his late father would have been "100% in favour". "I can understand why [George] feels strongly about it [but] I don't see why everyone is bickering about it," he told the Associated Press. The release of the new Star Trek film follows the sudden death of cast member Anton Yelchin, who died in a car accident at his home. The 27-year-old, who is seen in the film reprising his role as navigator Pavel Chekov, died last month after his Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled backwards and pinned him against a fence. Pine, who shares a number of scenes with Yelchin in the film, told the BBC he felt "lucky and blessed to have had a deeper experience with Anton this time around". Lin's film carries dedications not just to Yelchin but also to actor Leonard Nimoy, the original Mr Spock, who died last year at the age of 83. "It was very important for all of us to find a way to carry his spirit through this film and through the work we continue to do," said Quinto. The release of Star Trek Beyond coincides with the 50th anniversary of Star Trek, an occasion to which Lin hopes his film will be a fitting accompaniment. "Hopefully we can reaffirm why we love [Star Trek] and build a foundation for another 50 years," the director said. Star Trek Beyond, which also stars Zoe Saldana as Uhura and Idris Elba as chief villain Krall, opens in the UK and Ireland on 22 July.

The 23-year-old Ivorian broke hearts across Great Britain when he snatched victory from Lutalo Muhammad in the last second of the men's -80kg taekwondo Olympic final. It was the Ivory Coast's first Olympic gold and he has, since Rio, become a national hero. He has been gifted a new house and a 50 million CFA franc (£65,400) cash bonus. Not bad for an athlete who only has access to poor facilities and finds it hard to raise funds to meet his training costs. Cisse insists, however, his celebrity status won't distract him from his taekwondo title defence in Tokyo in 2020. "People look at me differently now, I've become a national symbol. I can't walk in the street without being recognised, I'm a star," he told AFP. "People approach you, they congratulate you, it's nice, touching, all this gives me strength to achieve even more." Cisse, who stunned third seed Muhammad with a four-point score right at the death to win 8-6, was honoured by Ivorian president Alassane Ouattara on his return home. He took the opportunity to ask for an improvement in conditions and coaching for athletes. "We were supported. The Government did what it could. But we need new laws passed so that athletes can live off their sports," pleaded Cisse. His request was heard and Ouattara promised to examine what could be done. "We have talented boys and girls in taekwondo. We have to help them," insisted Cisse. "I want to tell my little brothers to believe in their dreams. I've gone from nothing to become someone, without any help."	The phrase "one man's loss is another man's gain" could not be more apt than in the case of Cheick Sallah Cisse.
Jin Ok scored the game-winning goal after GB had come back from 2-0 down. Third-period goals from Angela Taylor and Leanne Ganney levelled the game after Jong Su-hyo and Won Chol-sun had put North Korea in charge. The game gives Britain their first point of the tournament but they are bottom of Group A after three games. "Nobody likes losing and it's disappointing," said Britain's head coach Cheryl Smith. "I am more disappointed because we took some risks. We were 2-0 down, took a risk and got the goal back. "We got our heads together and the girls listened and we got back into the game. "The game was going our way when we got back into it at 2-2, but we just didn't finish it. "We had the chances in overtime but we just did not get it done." Britain, who have also lost to the Netherlands and South Korea in this event, return to action tomorrow when they face Slovenia at 16:30 (08:30 BST).	Great Britain's women fell to an overtime defeat by North Korea in their third Group A game in World Championship Division Two in Gangneung.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that 2,500 homes were repossessed in April, May and June, down from 3,000 in the previous quarter. This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. "This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular," said CML director general Paul Smee. "As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening." Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than Â£1.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said. Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance. Ministry of Justice figures, also published on Thursday, show that the number of homeowners in England and Wales facing court action at the earliest stage of the repossession process fell during the second quarter of the year. However, the number of tenants evicted by landlords in the second quarter of the year rose by 4% compared with the same period last year, to 10,361. Seasonally adjusted figures show a 1% decrease compared to the first three months of the year. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: "These figures are a stark warning that relentless rent rises and welfare cuts have contributed to thousands of hard-pressed families losing their home."	The number of homes repossessed in the UK fell again in the second quarter of the year as fewer owners fell behind on mortgage repayments.
5 September 2016 Last updated at 18:13 BST With 500 million consumers, the European market accounts for 73% of the UK's agri-food exports, including 40% of Scottish lamb. Willie Johnston speaks to Scottish farmers about the prospect of leaving the European Union.	In the last Common Agricultural Policy re-negotiation more than Â£4.5bn was earmarked for Scotland from 2014 to 2020.
New pictures of the surface reveal a lumpy texture in places that researchers speculate could have been the body's original building blocks. Their appearance means they are being dubbed "goosebumps", which is a bit of fun given the comet's duck-like shape. But if this interpretation is correct, it represents a major discovery. "We still have to model this, but I think they really could be pointing back in time to the early days of the Solar System - to the formation of the building blocks of cometary nuclei," said imaging team leader Holger Sierks from the Max-Planck-Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. "Our thinking is that accreting gas and dust would have formed little 'pebbles' at first that grew and grew until they got up to the size of these goosebumps - about 3m in size - and for whatever reason, they couldn't then grow any further. "Eventually, they'd have found a region of instability and clumped together to form the nucleus," he told BBC News. Rosetta team-member Stephen Lowry said the goosebumps (which to some also look like a clutch of "dinosaur eggs") were among the most startling results to have come out of the mission so far. "Remember, these objects would have formed at least 4.5 billion years ago. Where else could you see physical evidence of processes that were happening that long ago? So, it's very exciting, but we have to be sure that this regular lattice structure represents genuine cometesimals and is not some feature that has somehow been produced as a result of ices simply sublimating from the comet; because we don't see the goosebumps everywhere," the Kent University, UK, expert cautioned. The presence of this lumpy texture on 67P is just one observation made in a slew of papers published as a special edition in this week's Science Magazine. The papers are really a first take at trying to characterise the 4km-wide "space duck", which Rosetta will be following throughout 2015 as it sweeps around the Sun. Cameras on the probe have now imaged 70% of the comet's surface. The unseen fraction, which lies in the southern hemisphere, will be mapped as it emerges from the darkness of winter. The team has defined 19 regions on 67P, giving each the name of an Ancient Egyptian deity. These zones - and more are likely to be added in future - display five basic terrain types, from areas of high dust accumulation to exposed craggy faces composed of rock-like material. The researchers report some fascinating behaviours over and above the expected sight of jets of gas and dust hurtling away from the comet as its ices warm and vaporise. For example, these jets produce strong "winds" that appear to drive dust particles into dunes. "It sounds highly improbable," commented Nic Thomas from Switzerland's University of Bern. "We see sand dunes on the Earth, on Mars and on Venus, but all of those objects have gravity and thick atmospheres. "On the comet, you have almost no gravity and it's not an atmosphere we could breathe. So, it really is difficult to conceive how you can make sand dunes on a cometary nucleus. The trick we think is that there are very strong winds there - 300m/s - and that these winds can, even though the density of the gas is very low, push particles around to make the dunes." Another striking occurrence is a kind "fluidisation" effect that acts to smooth some surfaces. Scientists think this occurs when ices change their structure. This results in a release of gas that can pick up local dust and make it move - albeit briefly - like a fluid. Something similar is seen on Earth when large volumes of hot ash tumble down the sides of volcanoes. At the bottom of 67P, the so-called Imhotep region appears to have experienced repeated fluidisation events, recorded in defined layers. The Rosetta pictures also pick up episodes of past explosive behaviour.  In one shot, a block of material the size of a football field has been lifted up and dropped beside the gaping hole it left behind in the comet's surface. Indeed, the violent release of gas at depth seems to be a common activity on 67P, followed by the collapse of material back into the void. The data being gathered by the European Space Agency probe is going to keep scientists busy for years, but it is clear already that many of the old ideas about how comets are put together and how they behave will have to change. It is obvious now that this comet is not a large lump of ice with some dust mixed in. Rather, it has a much more complex construction, incorporating significantly more dust and many rocky components. This is very evident from the ratio of dust to gas being ejected by the comet (four to one), and all those craggy cliff features where stiff, consolidated materials seem to dominate. "We used to think of comets as 'dirty snowballs'; we now think 'icy dirt-ball' is a much better description," said Simon Green from the UK's Open University. "That's the way 67P looks - a solid object with ice vaporising from somewhere below the surface." Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos	Scientists working on Europe's Rosetta probe, which is tracking Comet 67P, say they may have found evidence for how such icy objects were formed.
Ball made just one replacement appearance after a rib injury picked up in October restricted his chances. "I'm really excited, there's been a lot of hard work gone in and some disappointments along the way" he said. The 19 stone seven Scarlets forward will partner Alun Wyn Jones at lock after Luke Charteris was ruled out. The hand injury suffered by Bath's Charteris and Bradley Davies' long-standing knee problem meant that Ball was the obvious choice to step in for the Six Nations opener against Italy in Rome on Sunday. Meanwhile, Newport Gwent Dragons forward Cory Hill sits on the bench ahead of uncapped Osprey Rory Thornton. The Wales camp are hopeful that Charteris will be available to face England six days later. Ball's only international start since the 2015 World Cup was in the friendly against England in May 2016. "In the Six Nations last year, I came in with an MCL (knee ligament injury), then in the autumn with my ribs as well, it's been a bit of a frustrating time for me and I hadn't hit the form I wanted to over the last year and a half" Ball told BBC Wales Sport. "I'm back playing a lot of rugby and I'm very excited to be playing [in Rome], there's always been a good log of second rows in the Wales set-up and it's up to me to put my stamp on the shirt." Autumn on the sidelines Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac described Ball as a "man on a mission" with some fine displays over the Christmas and New Year period. That came after an awkward experience in November, when he made a brief replacement appearance against Japan but missed out to Charteris, Jones and Hill against South Africa. "Being [in the Wales camp] and watching the boys playing and not being involved is heartbreaking," he said. "You always want to be here and involved in some way, sometimes it even drives you a bit more seeing boys coming in and doing well." New freedom for Italy Ball, who wins his 22nd cap in Rome, says Italy could be free to play more open rugby, conditions permitting, under new coach Conor O'Shea. "Conor O'Shea has brought something a bit different, he's freshened things up and they'll be a revived team," he added. "He was saying they've got the freedom to go out there and play, and teams like that are always dangerous." Ball and Jones will be up against Treviso's Marco Fuser and his Scottish-born partner George Biagi, now with Zebre.	Wales lock Jake Ball says he wants to put his stamp on a second-row shirt after the "heartbreak" of the 2016 autumn series.
He spoke to the Pathe Gazette about his idea of the "national minimum". Sir William explained that it meant no-one was to fall below a certain standard of living. He said: "It preserves the maximum of individual freedom and responsibility which is consistent with the abolition of want." The concepts which he developed laid the foundation for the welfare state. But 73 years on, want has not been abolished. Much discussion over welfare at Stormont has focused on the "most vulnerable" and how they would be affected by changes to benefits. What policies would be for the best is a matter of debate. But among people who currently receive benefits, the uncertainty is a common concern. West Belfast has some of the highest levels of deprivation in the UK. The Falls Women's Centre runs services aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty. These include education, advice, counselling and much else. But staff and users say recent cuts have hit the centre hard, and the doubt over welfare is causing more anxiety in the community. Aisling White is a single parent with three children. "No-one knows what's coming in," she told the BBC's The View programme. "It's 2015 - you feel like we're going back a number of years rather than moving back into the future." She is training for counselling qualification at the centre, but funding cuts are threatening that. "I want to have a good job for myself and my children," she said. "But I'm struggling, and find it very hard to find the money to go and do the diploma." Angie Creighton is also worried about the combined effect of cuts to grants to community organisation and the continuing uncertainty over welfare. "It's frightening for people - the elderly, people with disabilities, people with children with learning difficulties." "I feel the local representatives should go door-to-door and tell people what's happening." "There are a lot of repercussions from the Troubles - the suicide rate is high among young men in particular." Eilidh Fleming, who is 70, worries about the lack of jobs for young people. "Companies come in to Northern Ireland, then all of a sudden they're away. We have to get proper jobs." The pensioner said it was organisations like the women's centre that make all the difference to people in need. "This place is why I get up in the morning and go out to face the world. Otherwise I'd stay in my flat and not come out." Another backstop to the welfare state is the network of food banks. The first in Northern Ireland was at Newtownards, County Down, in 2011. Now there are more than a dozen, with several more in development. In the last year, almost 17,500 food parcels were handed out to people to help them through a crisis in the short term. The volunteers at Newtownards Foodbank told The View that there were a range of reasons why someone would not be able to afford food. Debt, a delay in the payment of benefits and redundancy are three of the most common. They see many people who are in a job, but who do not have enough money to put three meals a day on the table. Foodbank manager Julieann Brownlee sais: "The food bill is elastic. If something in someone's family changes, and there's a crisis, food is the first to go. "We see it week-in, week-out - heat or eat. Because it hasn't been warm recently, people are still making the choice as to whether to heat their home or buy food." There is no shortage of demand for charity. As of February this year, there were just over 250,000 people between 18 and 65 claiming what is called a 'key benefit': that includes jobseekers' allowance, employment and support allowance and income support. The number receiving disability living allowance (DLA) was just over 200,000 people. That is 11% of the population - twice the UK rate. Michaela Hollywood has campaigned on disability issues. She has muscular dystrophy, and is doing a masters degree. She said there should be changes to the welfare system, but has some worries. "I've seen every trick in the book, but not everyone is playing it. "I know there are people who try to work the system, but at the same time there are many genuine cases who don't get what they deserve." Welfare, work and wealth have become the defining issues of this Stormont administration. As the questions over its future remain the questions of people affected by its decisions are increasing. Chris Page's report will be broadcast on The View on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:45 BST on Thursday 4 June.	In 1942, the economist Sir William Beveridge set out a vision which was to shape the times.
The 36-year-old was sacked from his first managerial post at League One club Oldham in January after just 20 games in charge. Former midfielder Dunn, who won one England cap in 2002, joined Rovers aged eight and made 377 appearances in two spells at Ewood Park. "I don't have to say how much this club means to me," he told the club website. "I think everyone knows what Blackburn Rovers means to me personally. "I'm looking forward to learning from the manager, as well as Alan Irvine and Rob Kelly who are some of the best coaches around." Meanwhile, Blackburn boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break to be introduced into English football. The 46-year-old made five changes for the FA Cup loss to West Ham and then six changes for Wednesday's defeat by Derby as they have a run of 10 games in 32 days. "I would have it," Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire when asked about the break. "I've experienced it and I know it's brilliant. "It's really refreshing, you go away and you come back and you've done another pre-season. "It gives everyone so much recovery from long-term injuries, for people mentally and it gives everyone a break."	David Dunn has returned to Blackburn Rovers to take up a position as Under-21 assistant coach.
The queue at St Ann's Square to lay tributes to those killed and injured in the attack stretches back about 260ft (80m) from the church to the Royal Exchange Theatre, as people wait patiently to quietly reflect on what had happened in a place so familiar and "close to home". Elsewhere in the city centre though, it is like any other Saturday, with bustling shoppers on Market Street, children playing in Piccadilly Gardens' fountains and people gathering to listen to street performers. It is a city in flux and one which is now, as with the rest of the nation, back in the grip of general election campaigning, following the three-day pause in the wake of the terror attack. But is Manchester ready to move on and talk politics? Kelly, 38, from Manchester and Donna, 37, from Rochdale came to St Ann's Square to pay their respects after the attack, which was "beyond belief". For Kelly, it is "too soon" to restart campaigning. "I think it's become all about this. I think it's become all about religion and I think they should hold off a bit longer frankly. "It's become too personal." Donna agrees that people are not "ready". "People are still reeling from all this. It's the last thing on anybody's mind. "People have died. People are angry about it, they're making the wrong choices because they're angry. "I don't think people are going to have the time to sit and think 'what is right for them in their votes' with a clear head. "People are in shock, still." Swapna and Anik Kali, 28, live round the corner from the Manchester Arena and believe life must go on, even if that means political campaigning. However, Anik warns that "politicians should not take advantage by commenting on anything... that's the only thing we can think about, whether it's early or not - it should not be a political issue". Swapna adds that what happened "should not stop us doing anything". "After everything that happened, everything was so sad, but [we] are definitely still here and enjoying and... holding up." Emma, 27, from Runcorn says the city centre "is exactly the same as it always is". "We can't be afraid [and] we can't let it stop us. "[The election] is coming up so close now and it's such an important one this year. "There are so many young people who have registered to vote now. It's really important to carry on." James and Danielle Yates arrived in Manchester from the West Midlands alongside more than 100 other bikers to "pay tribute" to the victims of the attack. James, 35, said it felt "very soon" to start campaigning again. "There are other things to be doing than thinking about politics at the minute. "I don't think it'll change anything in the election campaign, [but] let people get over it a bit first. But 33-year-old Chris, who lives in Salford Quays, disagrees, saying that "it needed to start again, because they are running out of time". "I think they've done well and not used it, but I think it is the right thing to do, because this is a really important election. "I think security, police, a lot more stuff about online snooping will be coming up." He adds that seeing Manchester "nice and busy was reassuring". "There is a really nice atmosphere. Like 'no, it doesn't get to us, we're still living'. "Life still goes on [and] I think the city is moving on. It is defiance. "All my friends have started going out again. We were out last night and having a good time and not feeling guilty about that."	On the first weekend since the Manchester attack, many people are carrying flowers and balloons around the city centre and heading in just one direction.
Both men resigned in 2014 after a series of allegations were made by garda whistle-blower Sgt McCabe in 2007 and 2008. Sgt McCabe made a series of complaints about garda conduct of investigations. Mr Callinan denied any wrong-doing when the allegations were made. The report identified serious flaws and failures in criminal investigations, but found no evidence of garda criminality or corruption. The 349 page report by the former High Court judge, Kevin O'Higgins, describes Sgt McCabe as a "dedicated and committed" member of the force who acted out of genuine and legitimate concerns about garda behaviour in his division and Bailieboro Garda station. The judge rejected Mr McCabe's allegations of corruption against the former commissioner, calling them "hurtful". He also said some of Sergeant McCabe's complaints against the force were over-stated and exaggerated. Sgt McCabe made a series of complaints, alleging there were cover-ups of wrong-doing, and said the force, as an institution, had closed ranks against him. Mr Callinan, who has been vindicated, denied all claims when the allegations were made. The report also found that the former Justice minister Alan Shatter had handled the sergeant's complaints in an "appropriate manner." In his report Judge O'Higgins criticises garda handling of several investigations carried out by officers in Bailieboro saying they were very poor as they were carried out by probationary members of the force and were not properly supervised. He says there were unnecessary delays and errors in some of the investigations and flawed disciplinary were followed after the complaints were made. While the report clears the former commissioner and the former justice minister, it serves to highlight problems in the Irish police force at a time when its critics say it requires strong leadership, modernisation, reform and better resourcing. In 2014 the Garda Inspectorate, an oversight body, released a report which described the force as "broken."	An inquiry into alleged garda wrong-doing in Cavan/Monaghan has cleared the former Justice minister Alan Shatter and the former Garda (Irish Police) Commissioner Martin Callinan.
Esteban Ruiz Santiago is accused of murdering five people at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport on Friday. During a 15-minute court appearance on Monday he was told by the judge that he may face the death penalty. Santiago answered the judge's questions in a clear voice. He spoke very little during the hearing and confirmed to the judge that he understood the criminal charges and that he is a US citizen. When asked about his employment, he told the judge that he worked for the Signal 88 security firm in Anchorage, Alaska, for the last few years and that he currently has only $5 to $10 in his bank account. Security was high outside the courtroom, with more than 25 armed police guarding the building. Santiago wore a red jumpsuit and was shackled at the wrists, stomach and legs throughout the hearing. Authorities say they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive, and that they are investigating whether mental illness may have played a role in the attack. In November 2016, Santiago visited an FBI building in Anchorage to tell agents he was hearing voices and believed that US spies were trying to control his mind. According to a criminal complaint, Santiago told investigators that he flew one-way from Alaska to Florida to carry out the attack. Agents say he checked a handgun into his luggage. He retrieved the gun from the baggage carousel, and loaded it in a bathroom before emerging and firing at random, investigators say. Six other people were wounded by gunshots at the airport's baggage claim area. Three dozen suffered minor injuries in the chaos as passengers and airport workers fled.	A 26-year-old Iraq war veteran suspected of opening fire in a crowded Florida airport last week has appeared in court to hear charges against him.
Media playback is not supported on this device In charge of world football's governing body since 1998, Blatter, 79, said last year he was standing down amid a growing corruption crisis. Five candidates want to replace him. They are Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Gianni Infantino, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne. The election process is expected to begin at 12:00 GMT, but several rounds of voting may be required before a winner is known. Media playback is not supported on this device Each candidate has 15 minutes to address the congress before voting starts at approximately 12:00 GMT. There are 209 Fifa nations but Kuwait and Indonesia are currently barred from taking part, so that makes 207 eligible voters. To become president after the first round of voting, a candidate needs to secure two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that mark, then a simple majority is required in the second round. If there is still no winner, then a third round will take place, minus the candidate with the fewest votes in round two. Fifa says a winner must be declared on Friday because an ice hockey rink is due to be installed at the Hallenstadion venue at midnight. So determined is Fifa to get this election done that it has spent £500,000 converting its headquarters into a back-up venue. Media playback is not supported on this device Given everything that has happened to Fifa, this is seen as a pivotal moment for an organisation which has been heavily criticised for its lack of transparency and for failing to clamp down on corruption within it. A new leader, together with a raft of reform measures, is seen as a chance to start afresh. Acting president Issa Hayatou said Friday can "signal a new dawn", adding: "This is our opportunity to show we are united in building a stronger Fifa." Media playback is not supported on this device There have been widespread allegations of corruption, the arrest of leading officials, the banning of its president and the sight of big-name sponsors deserting the organisation. Numerous Fifa officials have been indicted in the United States, while Swiss authorities are also investigating the organisation. Blatter has also been banned from all football activity for six years after being found guilty of breaching Fifa's ethics rules over a $2m (£1.3m) "disloyal payment" to the head of European football's governing body Uefa, Michel Platini, who had been favourite to succeed the Swiss. Former France captain Platini was also suspended. Both men deny any wrongdoing and are appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Furthermore, Jerome Valcke, Fifa's secretary general and formerly Blatter's right-hand man, was banned for 12 years following allegations - which he denies - of misconduct while in office. Media playback is not supported on this device Fifa's leader is the figurehead for world football, often seen in public alongside presidents, prime ministers and royalty. There have been eight of them so far, presiding over the organisation's executive committee, which is where the real decision-making power lies. Fifa organises World Cups and other international tournaments, distributes broadcasting rights and should both protect and develop the world's most popular sport. The president also "legally represents" the organisation, "maintains relations between Fifa and the confederations, members, political bodies and international organisations", and "implements the decisions passed by the congress and the executive committee". There are five candidates, from Africa, Europe and the Middle East: Prince Ali bin al-Hussein Jerome Champagne Gianni Infantino Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa Tokyo Sexwale Read more: the five candidates profiled Media playback is not supported on this device Prince Ali: "I'm a candidate beholden to no one. I wouldn't apply political pressure or coercion. I'm the only candidate from a national association." Infantino: "I'm not a politician, I'm football person and I'm a worker. If we stop doing politics and start doing football, the world will admire us." Sheikh Salman: "My past and my track record speaks for itself. We want someone who is responsible and can deliver the promises he says." Champagne: "I want a Fifa that serves football, that serves you. The Fifa I dream of is one which correct the inequalities." Sexwale: "I'm here, despite any obstacle. My life experience as a fighter, someone who dies wearing his boots... I have come this far." Prince Ali wants to quadruple the amount Fifa's member associations receive - believing it will increase their sustainability - but wants the money properly accounted for. Infantino would expand the World Cup to 40 teams to ensure more smaller nations can participate. He also wants to hugely expand Fifa's development plan by investing £860m of its revenues and giving £3.6m to each member association. Sheikh Salman's big idea is to split Fifa in two with a business side handling commercial issues and the football side organising World Cups and developing the game. He believes this would stop executives making self-interested decisions. Champagne's most recent manifesto, Hope For Football, emphasised "rebalancing" the inequality in football and "reconciling" the game's "protagonists". He wants to modernise - by introducing technology to help referees, having women in key Fifa roles and run Fifa like a public sector organisation. Sexwale has focused on his background in administration in the election run-up. His manifesto headline was the idea to put sponsors on national teams shirts to help raise money for the football associations. Sheikh Salman is the front runner because he has the backing of his own Asian confederation, as well as Africa. The continents do not vote as a block and the ballot is held in secret. But such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated and may not be hard to deny. Infantino, who is effectively in charge of European football following the suspension of Uefa president Platini. The 45-year-old has, according to his camp, made gains in recent weeks and they believe he is the man to beat. On Thursday, Infantino told BBC Sport he was expecting 105 out of 207 votes in the first round - the same as Salman predicts for himself. Uefa's general secretary has strong support in Europe and South America, as well as significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean and his camp also thinks he will get half the votes in Africa. If those predictions prove true, he will win. Prince Ali lost out to Blatter in last year's election and looks like missing out again after failing to make gains after Platini was banned. However, if he does drop out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate he could still be an important influence in deciding the eventual winner. As for Champagne and Sexwale, who is a former political prisoner on South Africa's Robben Island, they are the rank outsiders. Media playback is not supported on this device The delegates are also being asked to agree to reforms designed to end the problems that have led to Fifa's crisis in recent months and restore the organisation's reputation. Specifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries. Another proposal is to disband Fifa's executive committee and replace it with a 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women. Greg Dyke, who will cast a vote as chairman of the Football Association, says the reforms are "more important" than the new leader as it will provide an "opportunity for Fifa to start again". BBC sports editor Dan Roan in Zurich: "Few fans or players would recognise these individuals, let alone know about their policies or have trust in their leadership. "The selection of Sepp Blatter's successor should be the moment the governing body finally consigns the tainted tenure of their former president to history, and symbolically moves on from the stranglehold he held over the organisation for so long. "Except to many, it simply does not feel like that. "All of the men running for president are members of the football establishment. Four of them have spoken to Blatter in the build up to the election, presumably to ask for advice. All are loathe to condemn the disgraced former president. "The next 24 hours matters a great deal, and much is at stake. But do not assume that it represents the end of this great scandal, or the solution to FIFA's troubles. We should all know better by now."

The six girls were taking part in the FIRST Global Challenge competition, which took place across three days and saw 158 nations compete against each other. They took home a silver medal for courageous achievement, which was awarded to teams "that exhibit a can-do attitude throughout the challenge, even under difficult circumstances, or when things do not go as planned". According to the New York Times, the team's mentor Alireza Mehraban said: "We are simple people with ideas. We need a chance to make our world better. This is our chance." A visa is a special permission that you get in your passport which you sometimes need in order to enter or stay in a country for a certain period of time Their story made the news because, at first, they weren't going to be allowed to go to the competition because of visa problems. They were told twice that they weren't allowed to enter the country so wouldn't have been able to take part. However, US President Donald Trump stepped in at the last minute and the girls were able to travel to the US and participate. The competition - which hopes to inspire young people to want careers in science, technology, engineering, and maths - will take place in Mexico City next year.	A team of girls from Afghanistan has won a special award at an international robotics competition in Washington in the US.
A statement announced the formation of a joint operations room following what it said was an increase in attacks on residential areas and displaced people. Rebels were said to have subsequently launched attacks in the province of Latakia and in neighbouring Hama. Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva said it intended to suspend formal peace talks. The cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia to make way for the talks has resulted in a significant reduction in violence since it took effect on 27 February. But escalating fighting in recent days, particularly around the divided northern city of Aleppo, has left it on the verge of collapse. "After the increase of violations by regime forces that included targeting displaced people and continuous bombing of residential neighbourhoods, we declare the start of the battle in response," said the rebel statement issued on Monday morning. The text was signed by the powerful Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, as well as several groups that fight under the banner of the Free Syrian Army. Later in the day, the Syrian opposition negotiating team, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said it "intended to postpone formal participation" in the peace talks, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said. Ever since Syria's truce came into force in late February, there have been repeated violations. But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military. This upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides. The opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role. I've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere. The HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said. But the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to "taking stock" on Friday. The US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said. Separately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an "intense conversation" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Meanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said. The Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances. The UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province. A Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency. Latakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province. Twenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group. Militants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz. Medecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.	Rebels say they have begun a new battle in north-western Syria in response to alleged truce violations by the army.
The poverty rate was 15% in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty, staying flat after three previous years of increases. Real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%. The average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011 was $23,021 (Â£14,300). Income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011, the first time there has been an annual rise in the index since 1993. The percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%, the report also said. Poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, at 15.1%.	The percentage of Americans living in poverty is statistically unchanged from 2010's record high, even as household income fell, a US Census report says.
The 20-year-old has made seven senior appearances for Rovers so far in his career. Born in Wales, he has previously had loan spells at non-league sides Taunton Town and Bath City. One of five players offered a new deal by boss Darrell Clarke at the end of the season, Broom is the second to sign on so far, after defender James Clarke.	Bristol Rovers midfielder Ryan Broom has signed an extended contract with the League One club.
Speaking during a parliamentary debate, Philip Hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister Jo Johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names. The petition, which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used, was started by Jill Cutsforth, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Julie Doorne, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals. But, Mr Hollobone, MP for Kettering, called for the government to go further. He said: "I think there's great merit in saying all fireworks displays need to be licensed with a licensed operator, and frankly, amateur family-organised fireworks displays in people's back gardens are basically rubbish." Labour's Angela Smith, a member of the the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also backed the petition, arguing that restricting the number of days the public and organised events can set off fireworks should be restricted. She said: "Ideally, we would end the use of fireworks in back gardens. But I do understand the difficulty in delivering that as policy." Instead, she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks. Mr Johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective. "It is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation," he said. He added: "Restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales, leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses." Bracknell MP Phillip Lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses. The government said following the debate it would continue to monitor the situation closely.	Amateur home firework displays should be banned, in favour of licensed organised displays, a Tory MP has suggested.
Samantha Ho, 39, was found in Curlew Place, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on Saturday. Her husband Timothy Allen, 40, is due to go on trial in Cambridge for her murder next year. It was previously reported Mr Allen was Ms Ho's partner. Mr Allen was due to appear via video link at the Old Bailey, but it was decided he did not have to attend. His first Crown Court hearing went ahead in his absence. Judge Mark Lucraft QC set a provisional plea and case management hearing for 13 November at the Old Bailey. He said the trial at Cambridge Crown Court should be before a high court judge. A provisional two-week trial has been set to start on 22 February. No application for bail was made.	The man accused of beheading a scientist was her husband, it has emerged.
He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar, also known as Burma. Mr Sarlan and other Indian-origin people were forced to leave the country following a military coup in the 1960s. Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight. It is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup. "After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support," recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist. 'Mini-India' Indians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy. Burmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup. They found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma. After weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country. The Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled. "Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses," Mr Sarlan recalls. Soon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them. Many went on to become Indian citizens. By the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a "mini-India". "We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu," says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school. Chinese goods At one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others. Several people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then. "We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately," says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman. Tamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh. Traders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay "extortion money" were shot dead. The violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500. 'Gateway' The insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises. Moreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential. The story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement. Many elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment. "If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai," says B Revathy, a university student. Emotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.

The pilot was flying solo during a training flight on Thursday and radioed for assistance while returning to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire. The Hawk jet was promptly joined by another aircraft from the same squadron as a wingman to provide guidance. They then flew in formation and landed safely. The RAF has offered no further details on the condition of the pilot. A spokesman said: "Flying in formation, and conducting an approach to land as a formation, is a daily skill practised by RAF fast jet pilots."	An RAF pilot was guided into landing his jet by a colleague in another aircraft after suffering "a partial loss of vision", it has emerged.
The Iridis4 has state of the art coprocessors which can each perform a trillion calculations per second - a measurement known as a "teraflop". The university said the new machine would allow academics to work on more projects at faster speeds. Iridis4 will be used for subjects such as engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. Pro vice-chancellor Prof Philip Nelson said: "Staying ahead of the game in high performance computing [HPC] is vital to help the university stay competitive. "Simulation and computation enabled by HPC are recognised globally as the third pillar of modern research and this investment will ensure we remain world leaders in this field." Iridis4 will be used for a range of research, including engineering, archaeology and medicine, as well as computer science. The world's most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, which can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second. The university said its new computer ranked among the top 10 in the UK. The most powerful is at the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Warrington. Others are based at the University of Edinburgh, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.	A £3.2m supercomputer, one of the most powerful in the UK, has been installed at the University of Southampton.
Barry Gray's side have taken maximum points from their last four matches, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. In the night's other two league games, Glenavon host Glentoran and Portadown travel to Ballinamallard United. Carrick Rangers play Amateur League side Crumlin Star in a rearranged Irish Cup sixth round tie at Seaview. The winners will have home advantage against Crusaders in the quarter-finals of the competition. "We are just glad to have regular games. There has been so much 'is it going to be on, is it not going to be on' since we have had the problems with the pitch at Taylor's Avenue," said Carrick manager Gary Haveron. Warrenpoint now lie just one point behind fellow strugglers Ballinamallard, Dungannon and Carrick at the foot of the table thanks to a seven-match unbeaten league run which stretches back two months. "We are in a position now where nobody wants to sit out games. All the players are eager to get started again so everyone will be ready to go on Monday night," said 'Point boss Barry Gray. "The players we brought in during January have brought a freshness to the changing room and competition for places. "They have brought quality too and the players around them have stepped up to the mark. "Whether it's enough given our poor start to the season, we'll have to wait a couple of months to find out." Glentoran will be out to avenge a 4-1 sixth round Irish Cup defeat by Glentoran at the Oval when the sides meet again at Mourneview Park. The Lurgan Blues must plan without striker Eoin Bradley, who was sent-off in the 1-1 draw with leaders Crusaders on Friday night. Portadown central defender Ken Oman is suspended for his side's trip to Ferney Park after being dismissed in the victory over Linfield but Ronnie McFall's side should have Garry Breen and Sean Mackle available again. Ports assistant manager Kieran Harding has hailed the impact made by ex-Linfield and Derry City midfielder Philip Lowry since his recent arrival at Shamrock Park. "Philip has outstanding energy and he covers the ground. If we had him from the start of the season, we may not be in the position we are in," argued Harding, whose side have moved up to seventh in the standings. Mallards boss Whitey Anderson lamented his team's performance in a 3-0 loss to Warrenpoint on Friday and has made clear that he expects more from his players. "You can try to play all the good football you want, but unless you can display heart and desire it counts for nothing. That's what I want to see," said Anderson.

Asked about the allegations surrounding the late entertainer, Mr Cameron suggested that the removal of his honour might be an option. He said: "We have something called the Forfeiture Committee, it's not chaired or sat on by me, but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours and obviously they have to do their job properly." Police investigating the alleged abuse say they are pursuing 120 separate lines of inquiry, and Scotland Yard says there could be 20 to 25 victims in total. None of the allegations has been proven - but the Sun newspaper has started a campaign to have the presenter's knighthood removed. Sir Jimmy was awarded the OBE in 1971, and received his knighthood from the Queen in 1996. Honours can be taken away in cases when recipients are, according to the Forfeiture Committee's website, "judged to have brought the honours system into disrepute". In January 2012, Royal Bank of Scotland's former chief executive Fred Goodwin had his knighthood removed because of his role in the bank's near-collapse in 2008. And in 1987 the jockey, Lester Piggott, lost his OBE after being jailed for tax fraud. But the Cabinet Office explained that there were no legal arrangements in place to remove honours posthumously. Part of the reason is that an OBE or a knighthood expires when a person dies - but it is also highly unusual for there to be calls for a recipient to be stripped of their honour after they have died. However, a Cabinet Office spokesman said it was possible that as a result of the Jimmy Savile case, the Honours Forfeiture Committee might reconsider the rules. He said: "There are currently a number of police investigations under way into the allegations. "The Order of the British Empire is a living order and individuals cease to be a member when they die. An appointment as a Knight Bachelor would also cease on death. "However, that doesn't mean that the Forfeiture Committee won't consider the impact on the honours system of cases such as the one under discussion."	Prime Minister David Cameron has entered the debate about whether Jimmy Savile's knighthood should be rescinded because of the sex abuse claims against him.
Reprinting the anti-Semitic book was banned after WW2 by Bavaria's regional government, which held the copyright. The copyright has now expired and Munich's Institute of Contemporary History is to publish a new edition. New versions are expected in many countries. Historians say the book helps academics understand what happened in the Nazi era. Its annotated version, with thousands of academic notes, will aim to show that Mein Kampf (My Struggle) is incoherent and badly written, rather than powerful or seductive. Many Jewish groups have welcomed this particular publication, saying it is important to have access to a critical edition to help explain the Holocaust, reports the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power. After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the book to the state of Bavaria. The local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to prevent incitement of hatred, although the book was so widely printed during the war that it remained relatively easily available. Under European copyright law, the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work runs for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death - in Hitler's case on 30 April 1945, when he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin. Those rights cease on the first day of January 70 years after the author's death, and so publishers now have free access to the original text. However, German officials have said they will limit public access to the text amid fears that this could stir neo-Nazi sentiment.	For the first time in 70 years, Adolf Hitler's Nazi manifesto Mein Kampf is to be available to buy in Germany.
Villa instead appointed Roberto Di Matteo, but he was sacked after 124 days and replaced by Steve Bruce. "They wanted bigger names I think, they took the lad [Di Matteo] and that is how it goes," Warnock said ahead of Cardiff's visit to Villa Park. "I thought at the time that's their loss not mine." The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age. "I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate." Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October. Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa. After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff. Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself. ''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out," Warnock told BBC Wales. "That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well. "I am not saying we are similar types, but we have the same philosophies regarding management. ''I think Steve is the right one now. He knows it's a massive club. He will be looking forward to it. "We have had some right battles over the years. He knows he's in for a tough game on Saturday.'' Warnock believes Bruce, unbeaten at Villa, deserved a crack at the England job. ''Personally I thought he should have been England manager at the time," he said. "With his experience, playing wise, what he had done and his age and his enthusiasm, it was an ideal position for him in the summer. ''I know Gareth Southgate has done a good job, but I am surprised they have not spoken to Steve again.''	Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock says he was "disappointed" that he did not get a call from Aston Villa over their managerial vacancy in the summer.
Joan Bates and her late husband Major Roy Bates moved to an anti-aircraft fortress just outside British territorial waters almost 50 years ago. They declared it an independent state and gave themselves the titles "Prince" Roy and "Princess" Joan of Sealand. She is survived by their son, Michael. Known as the "Prince" of Sealand, he has controlled Sealand, seven miles off the coast, since the death of his father in 2012. Over the years, Sealand, a 10,000 sq ft platform, has encountered armed attacks by pirates and government bids to shut it down. More on this and other Suffolk stories. "Prince" Michael of Sealand said: "My parents will always be remembered for shaking up the establishment with pirate radio, declaring Sealand's independence and confronting the Royal Navy and other foreign governments." In 1978, three foreign men landed at Sealand by helicopter and overpowered Michael to claim the 'principality' as their own. Mr Bates soon arrived, took two of the men hostage and regained control of the fort.	A woman who helped establish a self-proclaimed independent state on a former military platform off the Suffolk and Essex coast has died aged 86.
Dentsu is accused of violating labour standards after Matsuri Takahashi, 24, killed herself in 2015. Her friends said Ms Takahashi  - who had been at the firm for less than a year - claimed to be so busy she slept just 10 hours a week. Death from overwork is relatively common in Japan, where it has its own word: karoshi. Ms Takahashi is reported to have worked 100 hours of overtime a month for some time before her death. She died on Christmas day 2015. According to reports, a note left behind for her mother included the line: "Why do things have to be so hard?" The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the company was being charged over illegal overtime, and that prosecutors were seeking a fine. That would effectively end the investigation, Kyodo news agency reported. The case against Dentsu targets the corporate entity, but not any individuals. But Kyodo news agency quoted Ms Takahashi's mother as saying she was "unconvinced" about the lack of charges for her daughter's superiors. The high-profile case has led to renewed calls for changes to Japan's notoriously long working hours and illegal unpaid overtime. Officially, there are several hundred cases of karoshi each year, although campaigners say the real number is even higher. Dentsu has made a number of reforms in the aftermath of Ms Takahashi's case, reported to include turning off the lights at 22:00 every night in a bid to force employees to leave. The agency's chief executive, Tadashi Ishii, offered his resignation last December over the controversy.	One of Japan's leading advertising agencies has been charged over the death of an employee from overwork.
The prospect of losing a vital source of income would force Mexico into a "one-time payment" of $5-10bn (Â£3.5-7bn), says Mr Trump. But US President Barack Obama said the plan was "half-baked" and unworkable. Mr Trump made his remarks as voters in Wisconsin go the polls to pick their presidential candidates in each party. The vote could reshape the Republican race, with front-runner Mr Trump, who has never held elected office, facing a strong challenge from Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In a memo to the Washington Post, the businessman says he would threaten to change a law to cut off cash transfers. Building a border wall with Mexico has been a core message of Mr Trump's campaign since day one, when he said there were rapists, drug addicts and criminals coming across the border. If Donald Trump isn't the 2016 Republican presidential nominee - if some time between now and the end of the party convention in late July the prize slips from his grasp, Wisconsin could be where it all started to go awry. At this point it's conventional wisdom that Mr Trump has had a terrible week on the campaign trail. His top aide was indicted for accosting a reporter. He stumbled when trying to answer questions about abortion, angering both the left and the right. Wisconsin's popular Republican Governor Scott Walker endorsed his opponent, Ted Cruz. And Mr Trump saw his lead in this pivotal mid-western state evaporate. By Sunday evening, at a rally in a half-full downtown Milwaukee theatre, the front-runner was showing signs of frustration. He mocked his opponents in the #neverTrump movement, which has vowed to fight the New Yorker to the July Republican convention and beyond. Is it all going wrong for Trump in Wisconsin? The wall plan has been widely condemned by, among others, Pope Francis. Mr Trump has also pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants. The Mexican central bank said that money sent home from overseas hit nearly $24.8bn last year, more than its oil revenues. In dismissing the plan, Mr Obama said it would cause the Mexican economy to collapse, sending even more migrants north to find work in the US. "This is another example of something that's not thought through and put forward for political consumption," he said. The law Mr Trump wishes to change, as outlined in his memo, is part of the US Patriot Act - he would stop anyone living illegally in the US from sending money overseas. Just the threat of enacting this would make Mexico "immediately protest," the Trump memo reads, and they would be compelled to pay for the wall. He also proposed raising visa fees and cancelling visas for Mexicans. If Mr Cruz wins in Wisconsin, as polls suggest, it will help him close the gap on Mr Trump in the all-important delegate count. Delegates represent their states at the party's convention in July and are accumulated by the votes in each state. A Wisconsin defeat would make it is far less likely that Mr Trump will have the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. If he falls short, his unpopularity with sections of his party means he could be deprived of the nomination at the summer convention. Currently, Mr Trump has 735 delegates, Mr Cruz 461 and Ohio Governor John Kasich 143. Democratic voters are also voting in Wisconsin, with Hillary Clinton facing a strong challenge from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders after his string of wins.	Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump has said he would stop cash sent home by Mexicans based in the US, until the country pays for a border wall.
Mr Banks said ex-leader Nigel Farage was UKIP's "biggest asset" and should be "engaged once again". In a letter to current leader Paul Nuttall, he criticised UKIP's tactics in the Stoke Central by-election where Mr Nuttall failed to unseat Labour. He said the party had wrongly adopted a "red UKIP" strategy, copying Labour policies on the NHS. Mr Nuttall, who was elected in November, has vowed to attract disillusioned Labour voters to UKIP, and hoped to capitalise on Stoke voters' leanings towards Brexit in Thursday's by-election. But he lost to Labour's Gareth Snell by 2,620 votes, securing only a slight increase in UKIP's vote share. The current UKIP chairman, Paul Oakden, said after the Stoke result that it might be years before his party, which currently has one MP, can pick up another via a by-election. In his letter to Mr Nuttall, Leave.EU campaign chairman Mr Banks, who also used a Sunday Express article to threaten to walk away from UKIP unless his demands are met, repeated his offer to become chairman in order to make it an "efficient, professional and ultimately electable party". He said his first move would be to bring in a CEO from industry to oversee a new membership drive, install a new team of "trained professional agents" to focus on target seats and use input from the public to draw up new policies. Mr Banks also called for a return to the fold for Mr Farage, who quit as UKIP leader after the EU referendum saying he wanted his "life back". Mr Banks said his strategy would include "engaging Nigel once again in UKIP - he is our biggest asset and needs to become energised with the party once again and work with you to deliver UKIP MPs". He added: "The party is at a crossroads. We have to be radical to become relevant once again." In his Sunday Express article, Mr Banks called for senior figures he said were part of a "Tory cabal" to be expelled, saying: "These dullards aren't bringing in Tory votes, Stoke proved that, so what are they for?" In response,  Patrick O'Flynn, an MEP and Mr Nuttall's principal political adviser, told the BBC's Sunday Politics that his advice would be: "Donate and don't seek to dictate." He said Mr Oakden was an "excellent" chairman and said the Leave.EU campaign had hardly been a "smooth-running brilliant machine". "I'm always happy if people who want to give money and support to our party want to stay in the party but I think the best donors donate and don't seek to dictate," he said. "Of course if they are expert in certain fields people should listen to their views, but to have a donor telling the party leader who should be party chairman, that's a non-starter."	UKIP donor Arron Banks has offered to become party chairman in order to bring about a "total rebrand".
Andrew Platten, 55, from Bingley, died at the scene in Cottingley Cliffe Road in the town on Tuesday.ã€€ West Yorkshire Police said officers had tried to stop the car after seeing the driver "acting suspiciously". Police said the car then "sped off and collided" with Dr Platten a short distance away. The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A 22-year-old Bradford man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail. Dr Platten worked at Leeds Beckett University. Its website describes him as an associate dean for international and collaborative provision in the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology. In a statement, his family said: "Andrew excelled as a respected and dedicated academic, with a love for art, poetry and music. For anyone that knew him, cycling was his true passion as he became a recognised competitive rider on the roads. ã€€ "Most importantly he was a loved friend, loyal brother and uncle, loving partner and a truly inspirational father. He will be deeply missed, but he has left his stamp on all who met him. "He will always be cherished and never forgotten, living on in all our hearts."	A cyclist who was killed when he was hit by a car police were pursuing has been described by his family "as a respected and dedicated academic".
The Sky Blues currently play in Coventry's Ricoh Arena but had a long dispute with the stadium's previous owners. The council said the club wanted to meet to understand how it would deal with a planning application. The club said it was not commenting "at this stage". The club's owners, Sisu, have been involved in a long-running stand off with the previous operators of the Ricoh that saw the Sky Blues play the 2013/14 season in Northampton. The arena is now owned by Premiership rugby team Wasps. In a statement, Rugby Borough Council said its leader and the council's executive director and head of planning had met with Coventry City in March. "The club requested the meeting to understand how the council would deal with any planning application for potential stadium sites in the borough of Rugby," it said. It said the plans would need to be finalised by September to be included in the council's local plan, but added that a site had yet to be identified. Peter Ward, from Sky Blues Supporters' Consultative Group, said he was pleased to hear that things were "moving" with the club's search for a new home. "It's good that finally there is some evidence things are happening," he said. "As we've heard from the club's directors, there is a need to take control of and have access to all the revenue streams." However, he said that fans could find a move out of Coventry difficult - particularly as they only moved from their previous home, Highfield Road, to the Ricoh in 2005. "The move from Highfield Road to the Ricoh was a big emotional move for the fans," he said. "This would be another big change."	Planners in Rugby have revealed they have been in talks with Coventry City Football Club about building a stadium in the borough.
Claire Lomas, from Leicestershire, was paralysed from the chest down in a riding accident in 2007. She began the half marathon, which runs from Newcastle to South Shields, on Wednesday and crossed the finish line at about 10:00 BST. The 36-year-old, who is 16 weeks pregnant, said she was "over the moon" to finish the run. Live updates from the Great North Run. Mo Farah wins for a record third year in a row. She broke her neck, back and ribs and punctured a lung when her horse threw her off as she took part in the Osberton Horse Trials in Nottinghamshire. Mrs Lomas has no feeling below her chest and used a ReWalk robotic exoskeleton, which relies on motion sensors to help her move and lift her legs to walk the route. Speaking to BBC Women's Hour before the Great North Run she said even standing in the suit was challenging. "It's taken some learning. It's not just physical work, it's the concentration with every step," she said. "It doesn't just walk for me. I have to use the parts that aren't paralysed to make it walk." She walked about three miles a day with the help of her husband Dan and was met at the finish line by her five-year-old daughter Maisie. She said she had struggled to train because of morning sickness which meant there were times when she did not think she would make it to the start. Other problems were caused by the heat, hills on the course and injuries caused by straps on her suit. "I had quite a lot of morning sickness. I didn't have the lead up I wanted, but I really did not want to lose this opportunity," she said. In 2012, Mrs Lomas completed the London Marathon in last place, inspiring many people with her courage and determination.	A paralysed woman wearing a "bionic" suit has completed the Great North Run, five days after she started it.
Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic gave the visitors a commanding 2-0 lead at the former Olympic Stadium, now known as the London Stadium. Andy Carroll pulled a goal back and then headed the equaliser before Simone Zaza hit the winner for Juventus. West Ham left Upton Park - their home for the past 112 years - in the summer. They overcame Slovenia's NK Domzale 4-2 on aggregate in their first game at the London Stadium last Thursday to reach the Europa League play-off round. West Ham's first Premier League game at the venue, which hosted athletics at London 2012, is against Bournemouth on 21 August.	West Ham marked the official opening of their new home with a 3-2 defeat against Italian champions Juventus in front of a 53,966 crowd.
The Republican nominee's latest outreach to black voters, at a North Carolina rally, drew a swift backlash. Many on social media questioned whether Mr Trump had considered the US history of slavery and segregation. It follows a report that his charity used funds to settle lawsuits for which he was personally liable. At Tuesday's campaign event in Kenansville, the White House hopeful said: "We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. "Ever, ever, ever." Obama's legacy in black America He continued: "You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. "They're worse, I mean honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities. "And I say to the African-American communities, and I think it's resonating, because you see what's happening with my poll numbers with African Americans. They're going, like, high." The businessman-turned-politician is continuing his outreach to African-American voters by meeting a group of pastors Wednesday in Cleveland, Ohio. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Mr Trump's recent overtures to the black community may be aimed primarily at assuring moderate white voters of his racial sensitivity. According to recent polls, he still faces an uphill climb in winning over even a modest level of black support. Aside from a blip in one unconventional tracking poll, Mr Trump's black support continues to be mired in low single digits. This is roughly equal to the levels earned by the Republicans who ran against Barack Obama, the first black US president. Last month, Mr Trump also raised eyebrows when he asked black voters: "What do you have to lose?" He told a nearly all-white audience in Michigan that African Americans "are living in poverty" and their "schools are no good". Mr Trump said his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, "would rather provide a job to a refugee" than to unemployed black youths. Meanwhile, his running mate Mike Pence has been defending the nominee against new criticism of his charitable foundation. What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? The vice-presidential candidate told NBC in an interview aired on Tuesday evening that he is confident the Trump Foundation "fully complied with the law". The Washington Post reported hours earlier that Mr Trump used $258,000 from his charity for legal settlements involving his Mar-a-Largo resort in Florida and a New York golf course. The transactions could violate federal tax laws against using charities for "self-dealing", according to the newspaper. The Post reported that in 2007, Mr Trump used foundation funds when his Palm Beach club was fined $120,000 by the town for having a flagpole almost twice the height allowed under local rules. As part of the settlement, he donated $125,000 to veterans' charities from the Trump Foundation. The foundation's money comes mainly from other donors, not Mr Trump himself. The Post also reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a $1m prize for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Mr Trump's course outside New York City. A $158,000 settlement also came from the Trump Foundation. The report was based on interviews and legal documents. Mr Pence told NBC there are "a number of factual errors in that story", though he was unable to specify any.	Donald Trump has faced criticism after declaring that African Americans are in the worst shape "ever, ever, ever", in a town named after a slaveholder.
Culture Secretary Maria Miller said "decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the £145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device -  accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year. In October 2013 Huffington Post reported that in response to a Freedom of Information Request the Ministry of Justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between January 2011 and March 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a TV licence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph "serious work" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: "The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system. "Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal." Ms Miller said: "This is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review, not separate to the process.'' The BBC's current Royal Charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how it should be funded, what it does and how it is managed. A spokesman for the culture secretary added: "Maria will put decriminalisation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions, but to do it before makes no sense. "She has made clear that the BBC needs to get its house in order, particularly when it comes to governance and transparency, having decriminalisation on the table during the negotiations will focus the BBC's minds." But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government's Deregulation Bill. It would make non-payment of the licence fee a civil matter, with a fine for offenders set by the government. He told the Daily Telegraph: "It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. "I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. "It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence." The newspaper reported that the amendment had been backed by 101 cross-party MPs. A BBC spokesman said: "Legislation is a matter for the government, however changing the law could lead to higher evasion. "Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations."	Not paying the TV licence fee could become a civil offence, rather than a criminal one, under plans being considered by ministers.
An active male role in the early stages of babies' development produced better performance in cognitive tests by the age of two, researchers found. The team from Imperial College London, King's College London and Oxford University, says the findings show the value of early paternal involvement. They said the signs could be seen from as early as three months. The study said there was "compelling support" for the importance of a mother's impact on a child's cognitive development, but more interest was now focused on the association between father-infant interactions and development. It said previous studies had found that men tended to have a "more stimulating, vigorous" style, encouraging a child's risk-taking and exploration tendencies, which in turn might facilitate cognitive development. For the purposes of the research, fathers were videoed playing with their three-month-old babies for three minutes on a mat on the floor, without toys, and then again during a book-reading session when the child was two. The videos were assessed independently by trained researchers, giving fathers a grading on their interactions. At the age of two, the babies' cognitive development was measured in tests which involved tasks like recognising colours and shapes. Join the conversation - find us on Facebook The researchers analysed data for 128 fathers and - taking into account factors such as income and age - found a positive correlation between the degree to which the men engaged with their babies at three months and how those children went on to score in the tests. The positive link between involved fathers and higher test scores was seen equally whether the child was a boy or a girl. But children whose fathers displayed more withdrawn and depressive behaviours in father-infant interactions scored lower marks in the cognitive tests. The study, published in the Infant Mental Health Journal, concluded: "It is likely that remote fathers use fewer verbal and nonverbal strategies to communicate with their infants, thereby reducing the infant's social learning experience. "More withdrawn fathers also may provide a less stimulating social environment, which may thus [have an] impact [on] the child's cognitive skills." Research lead Professor Paul Ramchandani, from Imperial, said: "Even as early as three months, these father-child interactions can positively predict cognitive development almost two years later, so there's something probably quite meaningful for later development, and that really hasn't been shown much before." Dr Vaheshta Sethna from King's College London added: "We also found that children interacting with sensitive, calm and less anxious fathers during a book session at the age of two showed better cognitive development, including attention, problem-solving, language and social skills. "This suggests that reading activities and educational references may support cognitive and learning development in these children." Dr Sethna added: "Our findings highlight the importance of supporting fathers to interact more positively with their children in early infancy." The study comes after research by Oxford University found confident fathers, who embraced becoming a parent, were less likely to have children who displayed behavioural issues before the teenage years. This research stressed the importance of a man's attitude to fatherhood soon after birth.	Babies learn faster if their fathers engage with them in the first few months of life, a study suggests.
The group had been sailing around the County Down lough on Wednesday when three crew members went ashore on Green Island. The cabin cruiser then developed electrical problems as it made its way to Salt Island, where it was beached. A Portaferry lifeboat crew was launched at about 11:15 BST and everyone was safely taken to shore at Killyleagh. Brian Bailie, lifeboat operations manager with Portaferry RNLI, said: "Once again all the hard work and hours invested in training has paid off with a happy ending. "With the start of the good weather and more and more craft taking to the water, it is increasingly important that everyone respects the water and makes all the necessary checks before going on the water".	Five men and two women were rescued by the RNLI after becoming stranded on two islands in Strangford Lough.
Chelmsford Prison told residents there had recently been "numerous incidents" of packages being hurled over the wall. One former inmate said the jail was "notorious" for being "flooded" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis. The Ministry of Justice said staff worked "extremely hard" to stop contraband from getting into prisons. "However more must be done, which is why the Justice Secretary has asked us to look at how we can ensure prisons have the tools in place to tackle this kind of problem," the spokeswoman added. Follow updates on this story and other news from Essex A woman who lives near the prison, who did not want to be named, said she had witnessed packages being thrown over the wall "four times in two weeks." "It's getting quite bad at the minute. The prison wants us to come to an evening to talk about what to do if anything does get thrown over," she said. "I don't feel frightened, but obviously it's not nice - I always lock the doors and everything." The former inmate claimed drones were used to fly contraband goods "straight up to prison windows", but the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site. The spokeswoman said laws had been introduced which mean people who smuggle packages over prison walls could be jailed for up to two years.	A prison has written to people who live nearby asking them to help stop packets of "illicit articles" being thrown over the jail walls.
In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was "the future" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. "After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells." He added: "Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life." But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. "Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs." Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: "This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. "It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. "Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be." Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an "ingenious approach". "We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. "But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours." She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years.	Scientists from Harvard Medical School have discovered a way of turning stem cells into killing machines to fight brain cancer.
Sheffield City Council said the cladding at Hanover House was not made of the solid aluminium panels ordered. The issue was spotted during fire safety tests carried out in the wake of the Grenfell Tower blaze. Councillor Jayne Dunn said: "We will not stop until we get to the bottom of what happened." More stories from across Yorkshire The council announced on Monday that a single element of the cladding system, added to the 16-storey tower block during a recent refurbishment, had failed new fire tests. Hanover House resident and tenants association member John Cawthorne said: "I personally feel betrayed." Ms Dunn, cabinet member for neighbourhoods and community safety, said the issue had been discovered following independent testing of the cladding at the council's 24 tower blocks. She said testing had been carried out despite paperwork stating "there was absolutely no cladding apart from aluminium on our buildings". "It's only when you cut in to it that you can see the layers," she continued. "I can guarantee you that we will not stop until we get to the bottom of it because they took a piece of cladding to the tenants at a consultation and they didn't put that up. "That was the cladding that we asked for. That was the cladding that we were told was on the building." Mr Cawthorne said: "The Tenants Association were given samples, which I kept for eight years, and those samples are 3mm aluminium sheet. "That's what the council asked to be put on this building, but that's not what was discovered on this building when the tests were carried out. "People are angry and I personally feel betrayed." Tests are being carried out on high rises across England in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire in London on 14 June, in which at least 79 people died. So far 75 UK blocks have failed fire safety tests in 26 areas.	An inquiry has begun after cladding removed from a tower block in Sheffield was found to be different to what council bosses had asked to be fitted.
The discovery was made during work to extend the castle's main shop and ticket office. Historic Scotland said the find would help establish exactly where the defences stood. European experts are believed to have been used to apply the latest Italian military engineering techniques at the castle in the 1540s. They were brought in by Mary of Guise, widow of James V, at a time when intermittent warfare with England made it essential to have fortifications that could protect against heavy artillery in a siege. The defences are shown in a 17th Century engraving by John Slezer. Gordon Ewart, of Kirkdale Archaeology - whose team discovered the walling - said: "We knew the defences would have been in this area, but not exactly where because the Slezer engraving, and remaining military plans, are not entirely accurate. "This is what makes the discovery of physical evidence so important - it helps us identify exactly what existed - and to understand more about what the castle was like in the past." Much was changed at the castle between 1711-14 when the old defences were demolished during a programme of modernisation. Further alterations took place when the esplanade was created in the early 19th Century. Peter Yeoman, from Historic Scotland, said the discovery gave a "tantalising glimpse" of the fortifications created for Mary of Guise and paid for by the French king Henri II. Mr Yeoman said they were probably designed by the Italian engineer Signor Ubaldini, who was working on a similar defensive spur at the time at Edinburgh Castle. He added: "They are of great interest because they were early examples of a changing approach to military engineering, and among the most advanced in the whole of the British isles."	Archaeologists have found fragments of Stirling Castle's 16th Century outer defences.
The French government proposed senior diplomat Laurent Stefanini for the post in January but the Vatican is yet to respond to approve the choice. The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. "France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal," said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as "one of our best diplomats". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church. Pope Francis is regarded as more tolerant of homosexuality than previous popes. "Who am I to judge?", he said in 2013.	France has said it will not back down over its nomination of an openly gay ambassador to the Vatican.
The Australian Open champions, seeded fourth in Monte Carlo, sealed victory in 67 minutes. The Briton and the Brazilian went 4-0 up in the opening set and held firm to remain top of the ATP doubles rankings. A reflex Murray volley sealed the match and improved their season record to 17 wins and only three defeats. In the final they will meet either Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut, who beat Murray's brother Andy and Dominic Inglot on Friday, or Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah. Brazilian Melo would have regained his individual number one doubles ranking with victory alongside Dodig of Croatia. But the second seeds, playing in their first semi-final of the year, were unable to take any of their four break points and decisively lost serve in the ninth game of the second set.

Chris Dent's 100 off 111 balls was the backbone of Gloucestershire's total of 260 all out. In reply, an 87-run fourth-wicket stand between Johann Myburgh (81) and James Hildreth (48) had the hosts on course until six wickets went down for 32. But Jamie Overton put on 65 for the last wicket with Tim Groenewald as Somerset claimed victory on 263-9. Overton made 40 and Groenewald hit 34 in an unbroken stand of 65 off 49 balls, the second highest 10th-wicket stand to win a one-day match in England. After the trophy holders were put into bat by their neighbours, Dent played exceptionally well whilst his teammates fell around him, reaching three figures off 107 balls before being caught at cover off Groenewald. Spinner Roelof van der Merwe starred for the home side, running out Iain Cockbain as well as dismissing Benny Howell, Tom Smith and bowled Craig Miles off the final ball of Gloucestershire's innings. The visitors reduced their local rivals to 15-2 as Adam Hose and Peter Trego fell cheaply. But they rallied well until Myburgh picked out long-off off Dent to fall for 81 and begin a middle-order implosion. Lewis Gregory was then superbly run out and Hildreth was caught and bowled by Smith in the next over as Somerset fell from 166-3 to 198-9. But, with 63 still needed to win, Overton and Groenewald refused to go down without a fight in this local derby, finding the boundary with ease. They survived one near miss when, with the hosts still needing 13 off 3.1 overs, wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick missed a golden opportunity to run out last man Groenewald.	Somerset beat One-Day Cup holders Gloucestershire by one wicket with just three balls to spare at Taunton.
CIA code that obscures malware's origins was detailed in the latest release by the whistle-blowing site. The code could be used to create a "signature" for CIA malware, said one virus hunter. The information is part of a larger cache about CIA hacking tools that started to be released last month. The release of the information could be "one of the most technically damaging" said Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California in Berkeley, in an interview with the Washington Post. "It seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations and attribute previous operations," he said. Before now, the information released about the CIA's hacking tools by Wikileaks has largely been only text describing many different ways the agency spies on targets. The latest release differs as it involves actual code used to hide the ultimate origins of malware used by the US organisation. It shows the obfuscation techniques used to make it harder to reverse engineer malware to unmask who made it. Included in the code library are fragments of Chinese and Farsi that are intended to be used in malware, as well as methods of moving data around that seek to thwart tools examining whether different samples have anything in common. Jake Williams, founder of security firm Rendition InfoSec, said the release was "significant". "It allows the attribution of previously discovered malware to the CIA specifically," he wrote, adding that the code samples could add up to a signature for spotting agency work. "It is likely that malware has been discovered previously which was not attributed to CIA then, but can be today thanks to the release of the code," he said. The CIA would not comment on the authenticity of the information released by Wikileaks, but a spokesman said Americans should be "deeply troubled" by the organisation's actions. "Dictators and terrorists have no better friend in the world than Julian Assange, as theirs is the only privacy he protects," said the spokesman.	Current spying campaigns run by the CIA could be disrupted, say experts, after more data on the agency's hacking techniques was released by Wikileaks.
The 40-year-old, who is based near Malpas in Cheshire, fell from her mount Topwood Beau and was airlifted to Bristol's Southmead Hospital. British Eventing (BE) said last week she suffered a traumatic brain injury. In a further update on Monday, BE said she was about to be moved to the neurological ward. "Emily is progressing steadily, and the family would like to thank everyone for their messages of support and thank Southmead Intensive Care Unit for their wonderful care," it said. Topwood Beau, a 14-year-old gelding, was uninjured in the fall, which happened at the third fence - Keepers Question - on the cross-country course. Gilruth, who is married with two young daughters, made her Badminton debut in last year's event. She has competed in British Eventing competitions for 18 years and runs her own yard.	British rider Emily Gilruth is set to leave intensive care after she was injured in a fall at the Badminton Horse Trials.
The 47-year-old Kerr, who presently coaches Stirling University's Lowland League men's side, will take over from Finland-bound Anna Signeul in June. And Grant believes Kerr can take Scotland to greater success. "She could take any men's team in Scotland in my opinion, she is that good a coach," Grant told BBC Scotland. "Anna's done fantastic, Shelley has learned off her and now she can hand it over and Shelley can continue and make the team stronger and better. "The squad is the strongest it's been and I think Shelley will take them even further than Anna." Grant, who is sidelined at present with a knee injury, is a former team-mate of Kerr's with Scotland and Hibernian, where the latter was also a coach. "It's a great appointment," said the Motherwell forward. "I was fortunate enough to play with and be coached by Shelley. "She's great in the changing room, she's a great personality, one of the best coaches I've ever been under, so it's great for the game. "She knows all the players personally and as players that makes a massive difference. "It's really important that we now have a Scottish coach and Shelley deserves it because she came up through the ranks as a player and she is also a great role model because she had a child on the way - Christie Kerr actually plays for my team now at Motherwell." Kerr became the first-ever female head coach in senior British football when, three years ago, she took charge of Stirling University in the Lowland League, the new feeder league for the Scottish Professional Football League. "She is just a great role model to have in the Scottish game, she's been involved in the men's game, which a fantastic step for her, and if anyone deserves the role now, it is definitely Shelley," Grant added. Kerr not only led Stirling University, who currently sit fourth in the league table, to a British Universities Championship final, she also completed a MSc in sports management. In a university statement, the former Arsenal Ladies manager said: "I have no doubt the academic education I received will be of great benefit in my new role as well as in the future and beyond." Stirling University director of sport Cathy Gallagher paid tribute to Kerr, who will remain in charge until the end of their season. "During Shelley's tenure, the University of Stirling has established its position at the top of British university football and the Scottish non-league game," she said.	Scotland boss-in-waiting Shelley Kerr is good enough to coach any men's side in Scotland, according to 104-time capped forward Suzanne Grant.
Marc Carter's plea to find a replacement sippy cup for son Ben was retweeted more than 12,000 times. The 14-year-old has only drunk from the double-handled vessels, which are no longer produced, since the age of two. Tommee Tippee said it will produce 500 cups after it searched factories worldwide and found the original mould. The firm's attention was drawn to the family's plight when Mr Carter launched the Twitter appeal to find a replacement. More on a dad's desperate search for a cup, and other stories His original plea prompted offers of help from as far away as Australia. Mr Carter, 42, said the response from well-wishers had been "incredible" and it was a "huge surprise" to be contacted by the manufacturer. Mr Carter said: "For me it's massive. Some people think I'm exaggerating but without it he doesn't drink so personally I'm very relieved." Tommee Tippee will send the cups on demand for free to the Carter family. Mr Carter said: "I would not be happier if I won the lottery. We've moved down to the middle of nowhere and don't want much. "Just knowing he has got these cups gives us peace of mind." Northumberland-based Tommee Tippee does not normally keep the moulds but had been searching factories around the world in the hope of finding the original plans. A spokesman said: "We are delighted to confirm that we are able to start production on a run of the original cup. "This will ensure that Ben has a lifetime supply and that his family won't ever have to worry about finding another cup for Ben." Mr Carter, from Devon, told the BBC his son has had his current blue cup for three years, but it is now falling apart and may only last a few more weeks. He said: "This tiny blue cup dictates our life."	A dad's desperate search to replace his autistic son's beloved "little blue cup" has ended - after the manufacturer stepped in to make a lifetime's supply.
Mae gan Gymru a rhannau eraill o'r DU rai o'r cyfraddau goresgyn canser gwaethaf yn y byd datblygedig. Nawr mae cynllun peilot yng Nghwm Cynon a Chastell-nedd yn canolbwyntio ar gleifion mae eu meddygon teulu yn amau sydd â chanser ond ddim yn dangos unrhyw arwyddion neu symptomau brys. Daw hyn flwyddyn ar ôl i feddygon ymweld â Denmarc er mwyn gweld y systemau diagnostig yno. Fe welodd swyddogion Bwrdd Iechyd Cwm Taf bod y gwasanaeth iechyd yn Nenmarc wedi gwella cyfraddau goresgyn canser. Y pryder yw bod claf yng Nghymru sydd ddim gyda symptomau clir yn disgwyl am gyfnod rhy hir am ddiagnosis, am nad ydyn nhw yn "ffitio'n hawdd" i unrhyw lwybr triniaeth benodol. Mae'n golygu bod meddygon teulu yn cyfeirio'r claf yn ôl ac ymlaen er mwyn cael nifer o brofion, a hynny yn cymryd sawl wythnos. Oherwydd hyn, yr ofn yw bod gormod o gleifion yn dechrau triniaeth pan mae eu canser wedi datblygu neu nad oes modd ei wella. Bydd 40 o feddygon yng Nghwm Cynon sydd yn credu efallai bod rhywbeth o'i le yn gallu cyfeirio'r claf at ganolfan ddiagnostig yn Ysbyty Brenhinol Morgannwg, Llantrisant o fewn saith diwrnod. Yr amcangyfrif yw y bydd rhyw chwe chlaf yr wythnos yn cael eu gweld ac yn cael profion gwahanol, a'r gobaith yw bod hyn yn digwydd ar yr un diwrnod. Ar hyn o bryd dim ond 35% o gleifion sydd â symptomau sydd yn "peri pryder" sy'n cael diagnosis yn ardal Cwm Taf. Mae meddygon felly eisiau cyrraedd y mwyafrif o'r cleifion sydd heb symptomau mor amlwg o'r clefyd yn gynt. Bydd clinig tebyg yn cael ei sefydlu yn Ysbyty Castell-nedd Port Talbot fel rhan o gynllun prawf arall gan Fwrdd Iechyd Abertawe Bro Morgannwg. Mae'r treialon wedi eu datblygu yn ystod y 12 mis ers i arbenigwyr o Gymru ddychwelyd o Aarhus. Fe aeth Denmarc ati i sefydlu'r canolfannau diagnostig wedi pryderon bod y wlad ar ei hôl hi o ran cyfraddau goresgyn canser. Yn ôl Dr Gareth Davies, Cyfarwyddwr Cyswllt Rhwydwaith Canser Cymru, bydd y cynllun yn tawelu meddwl claf ond hefyd yn cyflymu'r broses. "Os yw'r meddyg teulu yn gweld claf a ddim yn siŵr beth sydd o'i le ond yn pryderu ac yn teimlo bod rhywbeth o'i le, bydd yn rhoi cyfle i'r meddyg teulu gyfeirio'r claf yn syth i'r clinig ac yn golygu bydd y claf yn cael ei weld yn gyflym a gobeithio yn cael diagnosis." Mae Gareth Jordan, meddyg teulu yn Aberdâr, yn dweud y gallai'r cynllun peilot wneud gwahaniaeth mawr i fywydau'r cleifion. "Mi fyddai gallu dweud, 'Dwi wedi gweld y gŵr yma, mae wedi colli llawer o bwysau... allai ddim ei anfon i ffwrdd i gael profion arbenigol neu pe bydden ni fyddai'r profion yn cael eu rhoi yn nhrefn tebygolrwydd'. "Ond mae'r ffaith eu bod nhw'n cael eu gweld mewn un lle a phob un yn gweld cynnydd cyflym, y tebygrwydd ydy diagnosis cynnar os oes ganddyn nhw ganser yn fy marn i." Os bydd cynllun peilot Cwm Cynon - fydd yn para chwe mis - yn llwyddiannus, bydd gweddill byrddau iechyd yr ardal yn cynnig yr un gwasanaeth yn y misoedd wedyn.	Mae arbenigwyr canser yn gobeithio y bydd cynllun newydd, fydd yn cael ei dreialu yn ne Cymru, yn lleihau'r amser mae'n cymryd i gael diagnosis o'r clefyd.
A yellow severe weather warning has been issued as the remains of Hurricane Gonzalo reach Britain. Coastal areas and north-western parts of Wales are expected to see the worst of the weather. The Met Office said while all of Wales will be affected, areas including Aberporth, Aberystwyth and Anglesey will likely see the strongest winds. "Hurricane Gonzalo will run eastwards across the Atlantic, reaching the UK on Monday night, bringing strong winds and heavy rain," said a spokesperson. "The strongest winds are expected on Tuesday as the low pressure clears eastwards." Gusts exceeding 55mph are likely inland, with 60 to 70mph gusts in some exposed coastal areas in the west. The forecaster warned that fallen leaves and blocked drains could increase the risk of surface water affecting roads, and advised that travel could be disrupted. Hurricane Gonzalo caused widespread damage and a power blackout when it hit Bermuda last week, with damage caused to houses and power lines downed. Irish Ferries has cancelled some sailings between Holyhead and Dublin due to the adverse weather forecasts for Tuesday.	Gale force winds of up to 70mph and heavy rain will arrive in Wales on Monday evening, said the Met Office.
A director of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said that local authorities are forced to make a "wicked" choice between what services they provide because of austerity. Adam Scorer was speaking after it emerged that the Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Some 79 people are feared dead. He told 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that while councils were responsible for trading standards, there was no central system to relay information about products to the public. "Consumers should be confident that most products are safe, but we do know that the regime is as strong as its weakest link," Mr Scorer said. "We don't have a central organisation of technical resources, we don't have core funding where we can be sure of who is going to be around to do this testing, and we don't have the right level of strategic communication to make sure that risks are placed on the system, flags are alerted and people are able to go in and do the right level of investigation of all the products that are concerned." Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable told the programme that trading standards were a problem area because they were not a statutory obligation of local government. "There are some things local government is required to do - trading standards not so," he said. "So when local councils are under financial pressure it is something they can cut back on." Although the Department of Business provides Â£15m annually for national trading standards activities, the vast majority of services are funded by local authorities. The departments were once known as Weights and Measures. Sir Vince suggested imposing an obligation on local authorities to strengthen trading standards, adding: "Or you could give them some financial support, which I think is what we should be probably doing, to have some ring-fenced money that supports what is currently a declining service." He was Business Secretary when former BBC presenter Lynn Faulds-Wood was commissioned to investigate product safety. She claims the government ignored her report. "I think Lynn Faulds-Wood's concern is she made recommendations that were very modest and did not entail public cost, [but] even they have not been acted on and that was where she is enormously frustrated." Sir Vince added: "There is a tendency at the moment to look at whether the costs are to business rather than whether the costs are to society as a whole." A Department for Business spokesperson said: "Funding and prioritisation for trading standards are decisions for local authorities - accountable to local communities and the people they serve. Government recognises that consumer protection goes beyond local authority boundaries, which is why we provide Â£15m per year for coordinated Trading Standards activity in the UK."	The UK's trading standards services have been "cut to the bone", making it tougher to ensure that household products are safe.
Hooker Hughes, 20, featured for Llandovery during the 2015-16 season while 19-year-old flanker Evans has played for Scarlets' Under-18 side. Both players have been included in Wales' squad for June's Junior World Championship. Wales play Ireland, Georgia and New Zealand in Pool A in Manchester. "They both enjoyed a very successful Six Nations campaign and will take confidence into the forthcoming World Championships," Scarlets general manager of rugby Jon Daniels said.	Wales Under-20 Grand Slam winners Shaun Evans and Dafydd Hughes have signed their first professional contracts with Scarlets.
The Swiss eighth seed played magnificently in a 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4 victory at Roland Garros. Wawrinka, 30, brought an end to Djokovic's 28-match winning streak as he claimed his second Grand Slam title. Media playback is not supported on this device Djokovic had been hoping to become the eighth man to complete the set of all four major titles. But the Serb will have to wait at least another 12 months before attempting to match the full set of major titles collected by Andre Agassi, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Roger Federer, Rod Laver, Rafael Nadal and Fred Perry. The 28-year-old had been a strong favourite to finally get his hands on the Coupe des Mousquetaires after beating nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray, but he was outplayed by Wawrinka. "It was an incredible atmosphere on court and I felt emotion like I never have before," said Wawrinka. "I would like to thank my coach Magnus Norman. You played in the final without winning but this victory is yours as well as mine." Djokovic was effusive in his praise for the new champion: "There are things that are more important in life than victories and that is character and respect - Stan you are a great champion with big heart." Their last four matches in Grand Slams had gone to five sets and this was every bit as good in terms of quality, with Wawrinka hitting 60 winners as his aggression broke down the seemingly invincible Djokovic defence. The victory makes him only the second Swiss to win at Roland Garros after Roger Federer, the man he beat in the quarter-finals. Having lost the first set of the final following a poor service game at 3-3, Wawrinka came storming back with a barrage of winners that left Djokovic looking lost for a response. Four break points came and went in the second set before the fifth arrived in the shape of a set point, and Wawrinka finally converted to level the match. It was merely a sign of things to come as the eighth seed tore into the Djokovic serve in the third, and despite seeing off three break points for 1-1, there was little the top seed could do four games later. A brilliant forehand winner was followed by an equally breathtaking backhand to earn three break points, and the first was converted as Wawrinka moved forward and hammered a short ball. The crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier roared as the Swiss hit an outrageous winner around the net post on his way to securing the set. Djokovic was now facing a third French Open final defeat and he dug in, taking advantage of a lull at the opposite end of the court to fashion a 3-0 lead in the fourth. The match was now on Wawrinka's racquet, however, and he came storming back to level at 3-3 after some brilliant defence earned him the break. Djokovic called on everything he had to stay in touch, finding two volleys - the second a lunging effort reminiscent of his coach Boris Becker - to save break points with the score level in the set. Moments later it looked as though Djokovic would force the fifth set that had seemed inevitable as he moved 0-40 up, but there was another burst of brilliance to come from Wawrinka. A volley, a backhand and a serve got him out of trouble, and he rode the wave of five successive points into the next game as two screaming backhand passes at 4-4 gave him the chance to serve out for the title. It was never likely to be easy and, after a possible ace was overruled by the umpire on his first match point, the Swiss had to face a break point as Djokovic clung on to his career Slam hopes. The Serb could only send a forehand wide under pressure, and given a second opportunity to take the championship, Wawrinka steered another of those trademark backhands down the line and raised his arms in triumph.	Stan Wawrinka stunned Novak Djokovic to win his first French Open title and thwart the world number one's career Grand Slam hopes.
Paulo Roberto Costa - who is in jail and being investigated for involvement in the alleged scheme - named a minister, governors and congressmen. Among them were members of the governing Workers Party and groups which back President Dilma Rousseff. But the names, published in a magazine, also included rivals of Ms Rousseff. Many of the names were published in Veja, one of Brazil's leading magazines, just weeks before the presidential election in which Ms Rousseff is running for a second term in office. Several politicians mentioned have denied involvement. Mr Costa claimed that politicians received 3% commissions on the values of contracts signed with Petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012. He alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes. Mr Costa was arrested in 2013. He is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names. Ahead of the election, Ms Rousseff's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival, former Environment Minister Marina Silva. The BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro says the latest allegations could hurt the incumbent further, as during her presidency Petrobras has dramatically underperformed and its costs have risen sharply. It has become one of the world's most indebted oil companies and lost half of its market value in three years. The BBC has requested a comment from Petrobras about the latest allegations and is awaiting a response.	An ex-director of Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras is reported to have accused more than 40 politicians of involvement in a kickback scheme.
The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday. It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal. Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it "a shambles". According to the draft, Labour would: On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids. First it would introduce an "immediate emergency price cap" of £1,000 a year. The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee. The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election. A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few." The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983. It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone. Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed. Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does . Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign. These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported. On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called "bedroom tax" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21. The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66. The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph. A Conservative spokesman said: "This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. "The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk." In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually. Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge.	A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees.
Mark Mason, 48, from Rhyl, died after being stabbed at the town's Home Bargains car park on 27 October 2016. James Davies, 20, from Liverpool, denies murder and malicious wounding with intent. Anthony Baines, 30, and Mark Ennis, 30, also from Liverpool, deny the same charges. Jake Melia, 21, also from Liverpool, has admitted all charges. The trial at Mold Crown Court has heard the attack was the result of a turf war which had erupted between two rival gangs over the control of the drugs trade in the Rhyl area. On Monday, Mr Davies told the court he approached Mr Mason's car with a knife and banged its handle on the car window. He said: "I just wanted them to see it and be scared. "It was a stupid idea when I think of it but I didn't know it was going to end in the way that it did." He said he did not inflict any injuries and he did not see how Mr Mason suffered 22 stab wounds. He added he only discovered Mr Mason had been stabbed when he was told as they drove away. The case continues.	A drug dealer has admitted waving a knife around in a Denbighshire car park before a man was fatally stabbed but denied using the weapon.
The London Taxi Company's (LTC) Ansty Park site in Coventry is the home of its new electric taxi, the TX5. LTC - which now employs up to 1,500 people - has invested more than £300m in the TX5 after manufacturing the black cab in the UK for 69 years. Administrators were called into LTC in 2012 before Chinese carmaker Geely bought the business the following year. Read more news for Coventry and Warwickshire The first electric taxis to roll off the production line will go on sale in London in the final quarter of the year, before being sold around the world early in 2018. It has been described as one of the great comeback stories in UK manufacturing history - and that is exactly what it is. Back in 2013 London Taxis International was on its knees and looking for a new owner. Then Chinese firm Geely came to the rescue and almost immediately announced plans to build a new factory - but not only that, it revealed plans to make electric vehicles and employ more than 1,000 people. It is the first all-new car factory in the Midlands since 2003, when Aston Martin opened its state-of-the-art plant at Gaydon in Warwickshire. That was on a much smaller scale, though. It is also one of the biggest single Chinese investments in the region and it shows that the West Midlands continues to lead the way when it comes to both automotive research and development and production. LTC, previously known as LTI, started life in the 1920s, producing car bodies for Jaguar, Rolls Royce and Bentley. It will retain its existing Holyhead Road premises in Coventry as a paint shop once the production of the existing TX4 taxi ends in the summer. Staff have moved into the Ansty Park plant this month ahead of Wednesday's official lunchtime opening, involving company representatives. The new site will house a research and development centre for the electric vehicle, with engineers accounting for 200 of the newly-created jobs.	A £300m taxi manufacturing plant which created 1,000 new jobs is to be officially opened later.
Christopher Tate, who also runs Donington Park circuit, said most of the British industry was in "Motorsport Valley", in central England counties. On Wednesday, the Welsh Government refused to underwrite the £350m private funding for the Welsh circuit. Developers say they have a new deal which could proceed within eight weeks. The Heads of the Valleys Development Company, which runs the Circuit of Wales, has said up to 6,000 jobs could be created by the project. Mr Tate, a director of the Association of Motor Racing Circuit Owners, told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme there had always been "an eyebrow raised" about some of the claims made about the size of the proposed Circuit of Wales. He stressed it was not a question of not wanting more competition, but being "surprised and concerned" about the figures involved. "When it came to the point that it was apparent that private investment felt it needed to be underwritten by the government of Wales, more eyebrows were raised, as you can imagine, among the members of our association - 17 of them, including circuits of course in Wales at Pembrey and on Anglesey - that said 'really? "'Wouldn't be nice if all our private investors got underwritten by our government?'." He said the recent announcement by First Minister Carwyn Jones that the TVR car company would establish a new factory in the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone and bring about 150 jobs, was still "a long way short of the much-vaunted 6,000". "That number depends on the building of hotels and restaurants and other factory units and industrial units and so on," he said. "Right across the UK - not just in Wales - there is not a shortage of empty industrial space at the moment. "The second [point] is, the British motor sport industry is very much focused on what they call 'Motorsport Valley' - running approximately from Oxford up in a loop through Northamptonshire towards Leicestershire and Derbyshire. "Now, in that area lies 50,000 jobs and they're all a little bit interdependent. "So it doesn't matter if someone had suggested that a new motor racing track be built in Cornwall or in Aberdeen or in Ebbw Vale or, for that matter, in Norwich. "It would still have been well outside the natural agglomeration of these industries, and that's always been another reason for the raising of an eyebrow." Circuit of Wales director Michael Carrick has been contacted for a response. The Welsh Government has declined to comment.	The motorsport industry is sceptical about locating the proposed Circuit of Wales track in Ebbw Vale, a director of a motor circuit owners' group says.

Charteris left Newport Gwent Dragons for Perpignan in 2012 and then signed for Racing 92 in 2014. The 62-cap, 6ft 9in player is out of contract at the end of the 2015-16 season and would then join the Premiership club. Gloucester had also held discussions with the 32-year-old, while the Dragons had hoped to re-sign him. Racing and Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips believes Charteris' departure would be a blow for the French club. "If we do lose his talents then obviously it is a massive loss. He is one of Wales' best players at the moment," he said. "There are not many 6ft 9in guys who can make as many tackles as he makes - 18 or 20 tackles [a game]. "He carries balls, he scrummages well, he can do everything on the rugby field and is such an athlete." Newport Gwent Dragons coach Kingsley Jones said they would like to re-sign Charteris, but feared they would be outbid by English and French clubs. Bath already have a Wales lock in their squad. Dominic Day joined the club in 2012 and signed a contract extension with them in January 2015. In October, last season's Premiership runners-up missed out on the signing of Dragons back-row forward Taulupe Faletau after Wales coach Warren Gatland blocked the move. Wales fly-half Rhys Priestland is also at Bath and concentrating on his club career during a sabbatical from Test rugby.	Wales second-row Luke Charteris is set to join Bath from Racing 92 on a three-year contract.
The cookery expert and writer is to be replaced by Saturday Kitchen regular Andi Oliver on next year's show. Leith made her last appearance during the series finale broadcast on Friday night, saying being on the show had brought her "huge pleasure" but that it was "time for a change". Regular judges Matthew Fort and Oliver Peyton will return for the 12th series. Leith, who is also a novelist, said she had enjoyed "eating and judging the very best in modern British cooking". She said: "From the first Great British Menu for the Queen's 80th birthday to honouring those who fought on D-Day, I've been repeatedly amazed at the inventiveness and skill of the chefs. "I am very proud of the banquets we've put together. However, with 11 banquets under my belt in more ways than one, I think it's time for a change and, with much hesitation, I've decided to relinquish my seat in the judging chamber." She said the new judge would be "terrific", adding: "I hope she'll continue my good work in keeping Matthew and Oliver under some sort of control." Andi Oliver, who is also a panellist on BBC Radio 4's The Kitchen Cabinet, said she was "thrilled" to be joining the show. She said: "It's such an iconic programme and I have watched it religiously from the very beginning. "I love that it celebrates the extraordinary levels of culinary excellence in this country, so being part of that and having the chance to taste some truly incredible food from the best chefs in the country is hugely exciting." She first appeared on TV in the band Rip, Rig and Panic with Neneh Cherry, and has also presented from the Brit Awards and Glastonbury Festival. Her daughter is TV presenter Miquita Oliver. Peyton said it was a "massive shock" to learn Leith was leaving, describing her as "a legend". "I will truly miss Prue but I'm a huge fan of Andi's and can't wait for her to join us," he said. Fort said he would miss Leith's "elegant presence, good humour, practical culinary sensibility and occasional verbal clip around the ears". He described her replacement as "charming, funny and blessed with sound gastronomic judgement". Chefs to have taken part in the series over the past 11 series include Angela Hartnett, Simon Rogan, Marcus Wareing, Lisa Allen and Jason Atherton. Friday's finale saw Mark Abbott, Tommy Banks, Mark Froydenlund and Adam Reid - who have five Michelin stars between them - serving their dishes at a banquet for people who have been honoured by the Queen, in an event to mark her 90th birthday. The first episode of the 2017 series will be the 500th since the show began.

Liberal Democrat AM Eluned Parrott said the Welsh government had "wasted" more than £52,000 on them at railway stations in south Wales. She accused ministers of spending public money to "promote themselves before an election". The Welsh government said it was unapologetic about the campaign. A spokesman said: "We are not going to apologise for informing the Welsh public about one of the most important economic and social projects in Wales' history. "Are the Liberal Democrats really saying that we should not be providing people in Wales with this important information?" Ms Parrott said her party backed the project, but added: "To all intents and purposes, here we have Labour ministers spending over £50,000 of public money to promote themselves before an election. "This is money spent only on marketing the fact that one day, years in the future, there will be a Metro in south Wales. "This is a cynical way of spending public money. The minister is wasting tens of thousands of pounds on a useless poster campaign." Work on the Metro is set to start in 2017 and finish in 2020, a government spokesman said. Formal consultation for the £600m programme to develop an integrated network of rail, bus and light rail services begins in 2016.	An advertising campaign promoting the South Wales Metro has been criticised as "useless" and a "cynical way of spending public money".
Bill Cosby 77 was to have been streamed from 27 November. It is not clear when or if the special will now be shown. Netflix's announcement came shortly after Tuesday's airing of an interview with a model and TV host who claimed Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982. Cosby's lawyer previously said the comedian would be making no comment. John P Schmidt said the allegations were a "decade-old [and] discredited" and that he did not intend to "dignify [them] with any comment". A follow-up statement amended the earlier denial to say it did not refer to Andrea Constand, an accuser whose civil action against him was settled in 2006. The latest allegation came from TV presenter Janice Dickinson, who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her after a dinner date in Lake Tahoe, California. "The next morning I woke up and I wasn't wearing my pyjamas," she told Entertainment Tonight. "I remembered before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted." Dickinson claimed she had written about the alleged assault in a 2002 autobiography but had been pressured by Cosby's lawyer and her publisher to remove the details. Dickinson, a contestant in the 2007 series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, is one of several women to have accused Cosby of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. Cosby remained silent during an NPR radio interview that aired on Saturday when he was asked to comment on the accusations levelled against him. The veteran comedian is best known for playing Cliff Huxtable, benign patriarch of an African-American family in hit US sitcom The Cosby Show.	Streaming service Netflix has postponed a Bill Cosby comedy special in the wake of allegations of sexual assault that have resurfaced in recent weeks.
A boiler house was set for demolition by Coleman & Company when it collapsed at the site in February. Ken Cresswell, 57, John Shaw, 61, Michael Collings, 53, and Christopher Huxtable, 34, died in the collapse. RWE NPower said a procurement process has been under way since the demolition company's contract ended in October. Debris from the part of the building brought down in a controlled explosion in July still remains. However, all clearance work on the spot where the boiler house collapsed has been completed. RWE NPower closed the coal-fired facility at the site in March 2013 after 43 years of service, and a programme of demolition work followed. A major incident was declared on 23 February after the boiler house collapsed. The last of the bodies was not discovered until September. The cause of the collapse is being investigated jointly by police and the Health and Safety Executive. Coleman & Company had been working at the site for two years before the collapse, but lost its contract in October, which it agreed was in the "best interests of all parties".	A new contractor should be in place to clear debris at Didcot Power Station by the end of the month, the site's owner has said.
Spain's Marta Corredera curled the hosts into an early lead before England striker Dan Carter doubled their lead moments later. Alex Scott made it 3-0 straight after half-time, before Kirsty Linnett pulled one back for the visitors. Three-times winners Arsenal will now face Notts County Ladies in the final at Rotherham on 1 November. In a repeat of the 2011 and 2012 finals, Arsenal made an energetic start and Carter struck the crossbar before Corredera's sweet strike from the edge of the area opened the scoring. Carter than raced clear, one-on-one with Sophie Baggeley, and calmly lobbed over the Birmingham goalkeeper. The Blues responded well to falling two-goals behind but Karen Carney's deflected shot was turned on to a post by Sari Van Veenendaal, and bounced back across the face of goal and clear. After the break, Arsenal made the win safe with Scott's powerful finish, before Linnett's well-struck consolation. In a bad-tempered second half, Carter drilled wide after a superb knock-down from Jordan Nobbs late on, but a two-goal cushion was sufficient to see Arsenal through. Arsenal manager Pedro Martinez Losa told BBC Sport: "We have been starting games well. I'm very happy with that. "The best feeling today is to offer the fans victories in the last three home games of the season. I'm proud of the players, the staff and the team. "This is the reward for everybody's efforts. We have to do everything possible between now and the final to prepare." Birmingham manager David Parker told BBC Sport: "Arsenal were the better side in the first half, that's won them the game. "Defensive errors and mistakes in that first 20 minutes were the difference. "Looking at the second half display, for long, long periods we were the better side and we really showed our quality."

Mr McKnight, aged in his 50s, was from Hillsborough, County Down. He was alone in the a two-seater aircraft when it crashed just off the runway at shortly before 11:30 BST. He was taken to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald where he was pronounced dead.  An air accident investigation is continuing into the cause of the crash. The airfield is operated by the Ulster Flying Club.	The man who died when his light aircraft crash landed at Newtownards airfield, County Down, on Tuesday has been named locally as Stephen McKnight.
Seven riders in the peloton crossed with the safety barrier down, but were not sanctioned for breaking race rules. Sir Bradley Wiggins finished 18th in his final race for Team Sky, 31 seconds behind German winner John Degenkolb. "It's the most beautiful race in the world and we get bothered by a train," said French champion Arnaud Demare. "This needs to be taken care of, it was dangerous. We went through but it was close." One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier which came down seconds before the 60kph train sped past. Race organisers said the peloton were 10m from the barrier as it started to descend and that the leading riders "could not stop in safe conditions". A police motorcycle stopped the rest of the pack, before organisers of the 151-mile race slowed the leaders to allow the pack to catch up. Former British champion and Olympic track medallist Rob Hayles, commentating on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, said: "That could have ended in disaster. "You could see riders nip across but that train wasn't slowing down." A similar incident occurred last year but it affected only the eight men in the breakaway. In 2006, three riders who were chasing a lone breakaway by eventual winner Fabian Cancellara were disqualified after crossing a railway line after the barrier was down.	Several Paris-Roubaix riders were seconds from being hit by a train as they raced over a rail crossing while a TGV approached.
Police said the 43-year-old man was subjected to a "brutal" attack at Century Mill in Farnworth, Bolton, at about 12:00 BST on 9 June. He died four days later in hospital. Kathryn Colgan, 24, William Coughlan, 25, and Alex Colgan, 28, of Ramsay Avenue, Farnworth, and Ellis Hampson, 19, of Oakfield Drive, Little Hulton, have all been charged with murder. The four appeared before Manchester Crown Court and were bailed to return on 11 August. A 16-year-old boy who was also arrested on suspicion of murder has been bailed pending further investigation.	Four people have been charged with murder over the death of a man who was attacked at a former mill.
Emmanuel Manzi from Italy won the event at Llanberis, while Richard Roberts was the first Welsh competitor to finish. Organisers say the 10-mile (16km) race attracts some of the best mountain racers in Europe. Snowdon Race tweeted its congratulations to one couple who got engaged after finishing the event. This year's race start was moved to Llanberis high street, where the very first race began. "The buzz in this little village come Snowdon Race weekend is unbelievable," said organiser Stephen Edwards.	About 600 runners have taken part in the annual mountain race up Snowdon with a series of other events being held to mark its 40th anniversary.
Johnny Rodrigues, chairman of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, said Cecil's head was found in the home of Theo Bronkhorst, one of the co-accused. Cecil was shot in July by US dentist Walter Palmer. Zimbabwe is seeking his extradition. The death made headlines around the world, sending Mr Palmer into hiding. Mr Rodrigues told the BBC the plan had been for the head to be sent to South Africa and then on to the United States where Mr Palmer would be able to claim it. But it was seized by police on 7 July from the home of Mr Bronkhorst, a guide on the illegal hunt attended by Mr Palmer. "The police have it all now and they are using it as evidence," said Mr Rodrigues. "But we are going to try and get the authorities to release so it can be mounted in the Hwange National Park as a memorial," he told the BBC. "We can put it near the entrance so people can pay tribute to him. We are just waiting for everything to die down." Only the head and pelt of the animal are left, he said. "The body has been eaten by scavengers and vultures but the head is intact." Mr Rodrigues said the Task Force would raise the money for Cecil's head to be mounted in a glass case and would ask the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority about the plan "once the dust had settled". "Any tourist should be able to come and see the cause of all this turmoil around the world," he said. No one was available for comment from the Hwange National Park or police station, where Cecil's remains are reportedly being held. Mr Rodrigues said he has been subjected to a torrent of abuse after speaking out against hunting following Cecil's death. "I had to put my phone off. Hunters are using this as a way to get to me, sending insults and remarks by email and by text." He said he had been accused of taking money from hunts, a claim he denied. "I hate hunting, I don't believe in it," he said. Cecil's six cubs were being looked after by another lion, Jericho, according to Mr Rodrigues. "We were expecting the worst and for the other male to come in and take the female and kill the cubs. But Jericho is doing a good job. "They are following him around and he is playing with them. We are monitoring them all the time and everybody is happy." Cecil was "iconic", Mr Rodrigues said. "He was a tourist attraction and I hope we can get the tourists back."	A Zimbabwe conservation group says it wants the head of Cecil the Lion to be mounted in a case in Hwange National Park, where he was killed last month.
Her 15-year battle for justice finally bore fruit last week, when the Bombay high court confirmed the life sentences of 11 men found guilty of rape and murder. The court also convicted five policemen and two doctors, who were earlier cleared by the trial court, of destroying evidence. The landmark ruling, Bilkis Bano told the BBC in Delhi on Sunday, had finally given her hope of peace. "I always had full faith in the judiciary and I'm grateful to the Bombay high court for the order. It's a very good judgement and I'm very happy with it," she told me. "I think the state government and the police were all complicit in the crime, because the accused were given full freedom to rape and pillage," she said. "I feel vindicated that the court has convicted the police and the doctors too. I feel I've received justice." Bilkis Bano's fight for justice has been long and nightmarish but, she says, giving up was never an option. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortems. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. Despite the gravity of the crime and the fact she identified her attackers, the first arrests in the case were only made in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators, the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court also accepted her plea that the courts in Gujarat could not deliver her justice and transferred her case to a court in Mumbai. The battle has been hugely disruptive for her family. In the past 15 years, she and her husband Yakub Rasool have moved home 10 times, moving in and out of Gujarat with their five children. "We still can't go home because we're afraid. Police and the state administration have always helped our attackers. When we are in Gujarat, we still cover our faces, we never give out our address," Mr Rasool said. The attack on Bilkis Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began when a fire on a passenger train in Godhra town killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs went on a rampage, attacking Muslim neighbourhoods and destroying their property. For three days the rioters had free rein, as the state administration and the police looked the other way. More than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then Gujarat chief minister, was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied any wrongdoing and has not apologised for the riots. A Supreme Court panel also refused to prosecute him in 2013, citing insufficient evidence. But he's never been able to shake off the criticism completely, with many holding him responsible for the killings on his watch. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for their involvement in the riots. In 2012 an ex-minister and aide to Mr Modi was jailed for 28 years. But many other people are still waiting for justice. Fifteen years later, Bilkis Bano still fights back tears as she recounts the horror of those days. She was visiting her parents, who lived in a village called Randhikpur, not far from Godhra. She was 19 and the mother of a three-year-old daughter, and she was pregnant with her second child. "It was the morning after the train fire. I was in the kitchen, making lunch, when my aunt and her children came running. They said their homes were being set on fire and we had to leave immediately," she said. "We left with just the clothes we were wearing, we didn't even have the time to put on our slippers." Within minutes, all the Muslim homes in the neighbourhood had emptied. The 50-odd families that lived there had gone, looking for safety. Bilkis Bano was in a group of 17 people that included her three-year-old daughter, her mother, a pregnant cousin, her younger siblings, nieces and nephews, and two adult men. "We first went to the village council head, a Hindu, seeking his protection. But when the mobs began threatening to kill him too if he gave shelter to Muslims, we were forced to leave." For the next few days, the group travelled from village to village, seeking shelter in a mosque, or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. But then their time ran out. On the morning of 3 March, as they set out to go to a nearby village where they believed they would be safer, a group of men travelling in two jeeps stopped them. "They attacked us with swords and sticks. One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock." Bilkis Bano had cuts on her hands and legs. Her attackers were her neighbours in the village, 12 men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her. She begged them for mercy and told them she was five months' pregnant, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. Her cousin, who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run, was raped and murdered. Her newborn was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. When she came to, she covered her body with a blood-soaked petticoat, climbed a nearby hill and hid in a cave for a day. "The next day I was very thirsty so I came down to a nearby tribal village to find some water. The villagers were initially suspicious of me and came out with sticks, but then they helped me. They gave me a blouse and a scarf to cover my body." She spotted a police jeep and they took her to the police station, where she narrated her ordeal. "I'm illiterate so I asked the policemen to read out the complaint once they had written it down, but they refused to do that. They just took my thumb impression and wrote whatever they wanted. I knew all my attackers and I'd named them. But the police did not write down any names," she said. The next day, she was sent to a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots. That's where her husband was reunited with her 15 days later and where they lived for the next few months. Her unborn child survived the rape and she later gave birth to a daughter. The past 15 years have been "very difficult", but the couple say the high court order has brought them some closure. In the past few days, comparisons have been drawn between Bilkis Bano's case and that of the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi. A day after the Bilkis Bano judgement, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the four men accused of the crime. Many have since asked whether Bilkis Bano's case did not merit the death penalty for her attackers. Prosecutors had demanded capital punishment for three of the men. Bilkis Bano, however, says she does not believe in revenge. "Both the crimes were equally horrible, but I don't believe in taking anyone's life. I don't want the death penalty for them," she said. "I want them to spend their entire lives in jail. I hope they will one day realise the enormity of their crime, how they killed small children and raped women. "I'm not interested in revenge. I just want them to understand what they've done."	Bilkis Bano was gang-raped and saw 14 members of her family being murdered by a Hindu mob during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western Indian state of Gujarat.
The small objects were hidden by artist Luke Jerram for his installation Treasure City, with clues hidden in paintings at the 20-21 Arts Centre. The first one, a replica Viking brooch, was found in a wall in Kingsway Gardens, Scunthorpe, by Rachel Welch. Ms Welch, of Grimsby, said she looked around town on the off-chance she could find one without cracking the codes. The object was found hours after the treasure hunt began on Saturday. She said: "We had a look at them, but we didn't really spend much time with them because we are no good at codes. "We thought we'd go out and have a look round and see if we are able to find one and we did." Bristol-based artist Mr Jerram said a Scoutmaster had cracked the code in the corresponding painting moments before, and arrived at the park to see it had already been claimed. This particular artwork used semaphore to spell out the clue "in the gardens seven metres from the flag is the Kingsway xx(rest)." The gold was hidden in a dry stone wall near a flag, given to the gardens as an environmental award. Each of the objects is worth more than £1,000 and Ms Welch said she was going to sell it to pay for a holiday. The second object, a small 18 carat gold lamb, was found in a bandstand in Brigg on Sunday night by a teacher from Beverley. She solved one of the painting's codes to lead her to a place which was "an octagonal place to listen". Mr Jerram said the woman searched Scunthorpe for somewhere that fit that description and settled on the bandstand but when she got to the one in Scunthorpe there was nothing there. It was that night that she realised there was one in nearby Brigg and went down there with her husband at midnight to claim the gold. The third piece, a model of a Tudor fisherwoman, was found on Monday but the exact details of where are not yet known.	Three of five gold artworks hidden in Lincolnshire as part of a treasure hunt have been found - the first by chance.
The Friesians were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field. North Wales Police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck. Anyone with information can call 101. "Apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks. Has to be living/working local to Colwyn Bay," Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on Sunday. A post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings. Sgt Taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media.	The description of a man believed to be involved in fly-tipping which left three Conwy cows dead has been released by police.
Goalkeeper Manny Agboola, 18, will be on the bench after being recalled from a loan spell at North Leigh. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is likely to make changes again, as he did in the last round against Birmingham. Striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (knee) and midfielder Jack Colback (illness) could return. Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford: "If we beat Newcastle, it would probably be as big a win for me as I've ever had as a manager. "I remember being manager of Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round and we went to Arsenal and became the only team to beat them in a FA Cup tie at the Emirates. "That was some achievement as we probably spent about 80% of the game on the back foot. But for me, if Newcastle were in the Premier League right now, they'd be a top-10 team. "They've got a fantastic manager, are a great club with a winning mentality and with fantastic support behind them." Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez: "We knew we had to make changes [in the last round against Birmingham] because we have so many games. "It is important to win, but using the squad and not taking too many risks with players was important. This competition is always difficult, but we will try to go through. "When you play against any team at this stage, especially away from home, it gives them extra motivation."	Oxford United could hand a debut to striker Toni Martinez after his loan move from West Ham, but forward Chris Maguire (thigh) faces a fitness test.
In a dismal Dons performance, Samir Hadji gave the hosts a deserved lead when he raced onto a loose ball and lashed it home just before half-time. As Aberdeen continued to create little after the break, Emmanuel Francoise thumped the ball off the post. But despite dominating, the hosts could not find the second goal they needed. The Dons live to fight another day and will face Latvian side Ventspils in the second qualifying round, with the first leg at Pittodrie next Thursday. But they were well short of their best, with Fola Esch claiming their first-ever win in a  European tie. It was Fola who were the more dangerous of the two sides in the opening minutes as they attempted to pull back the two-goal deficit from the first leg. An audacious effort from the halfway line almost caught out Dons goalkeeper Joe Lewis, before Hadji raced to the near post and tested the Englishman from close-range. The hosts pressed again when Mehdi Kirch sent a left-foot shot wide from distance, before Shay Logan had a similar strike at the other end with Aberdeen's first effort of the game. Peter Pawlett, making a rare start for the Dons in place of the rested Niall McGinn, cut a neat ball across from the byline for Jayden Stockley and goalkeeper Thomas Hym had to be alert to deny him from close-range. The best chances were continuing to fall to the hosts, though. Hadji was not too far away with a back-post header from a corner, before Stefano Bensi volleyed over. A goal was coming and it was no surprise when Hadji found the net on the stroke of half-time. Bensi stabbed the ball through the heart of the defence, and with Ash Taylor caught between the player and the ball, Hadji raced past him and fired beyond goalkeeper Joe Lewis. Manager Derek McInnes' frustration was apparent with a double substitution at the interval, with Pawlett and debutant Anthony O'Connor being replaced by Willo Flood and Mark Reynolds. The Dons though continued to toil and goalkeeper Lewis twice denied the hosts in quick succession; first tipping Bensi's curling effort wide before getting to Tom Laterza's low shot from the resultant corner. A second goal from the hosts would have been enough to send the Dons out of Europe, and that nearly became a reality when Logan stood off Francoise and allowed him to rattle the ball off the inside of the post. Flood appeared to have injured himself in a clumsy challenge on Fola's Ryan Klapp, and with Aberdeen having used all three substitutes, he was a passenger for the final 20 minutes. That allowed the home side to continue to go forward in numbers, and Gerson Rodrigues should have done better with a weak shot from the edge of the box. Adam Rooney was booked for diving after going down in the box in a rare reprieve from late Fola pressure, with Hadji nearly poking a cross beyond Lewis in the last minute.	Aberdeen limped into the second qualifying round of the Europa league with a 3-2 aggregate win, despite going down to Fola Esch in Luxembourg.
The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close when his low shot was saved by Stephen Bywater. Tom Naylor inadvertently put the ball in his own net after the break before Daniel Sturridge tapped in his first and then thumped home the Reds' fifth. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made only four changes from the XI that started in the 2-0 league defeat at Burnley on Saturday. The quality of the visiting team was soon apparent at the Pirelli Stadium against a Burton side who have had a mixed start to their first ever season in the Championship. After Liverpool's Belgian forward Origi cleverly profited from tricky work in the box from Sadio Mane, Brazilian Firmino doubled the lead following a terrible throw-out from goalkeeper Bywater. It was 3-0 just after the hour when the unfortunate Naylor had little time to react as James Milner's ball came towards him at pace. And substitute Sturridge then grabbed a late double, converting at the far post from Milner's pass before firing in low from 15 yards. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "There were still a few situations where we were missing a bit of sharpness but the main problem was, it was unbelievable, our build-up and style of play at Burnley - one more pass but 15 times we are completely free in the box. "So we needed to use this game and that's what we did and it was better." Burton manager Nigel Clough: "It's difficult for our lads to compete with that sort of quality. With this being 72 hours before the Derby game, our focus was always with that one. "When you think we finished with a couple of teenagers and a 20- or 21-year-old, you could train with them for a couple of seasons and not gain the experience they've got tonight."	A strong Liverpool side overwhelmed Championship outfit Burton Albion to reach the EFL Cup third round.
Archaeologists working with the Ministry of Defence, which is building hundreds of military homes at Larkhill, made the discovery. The site was used to emulate conditions soldiers would face in trenches in France and Belgium during the war. More than 100 pieces of graffiti have been uncovered in the chalk walls of the trenches and tunnels. Soldiers training on the site who left their names include decorated heroes and one recorded deserter. The names feature Wiltshire men as well as West Yorkshire coal miners, and two brothers wrote "Semper Fidelis" (Ever Faithful) beneath their signatures. Archaeologist Si Cleggett, who described the Larkhill excavation as "unique", said:  "It has been a humbling experience to stand and read the names of young soldiers in the very spaces they occupied before leaving for war. "Having stood in their footprints a century after their time at Larkhill, we really will remember them." Training relics such as grenades, ammunition and food tins were also found. The Australian 3rd Division infantry trained on Salisbury Plain in 1916 and the dig uncovered a chalk plaque inscribed with the names of Australian bombers - soldiers specially trained to use hand grenades. One name is Private Lawrence Carthage Weathers, who won the Victoria Cross in September 1918 for attacking a machine gun post with grenades, capturing it and taking 180 prisoners. Steve White, of building contractors GABLE, said the Larkhill tunnels project "represented a unique opportunity to be a part of a story of unprecedented archaeological significance". About 4,300 soldiers and their families are to move to Wiltshire from Germany and UK bases by 2019 as part of the Army Basing Plan.	A "unique" network of tunnels used to train soldiers to fight in World War One has been found on Salisbury Plain.
Former Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) chief executive Nazir Afzal was advised against doing so by the organisation's board. This was because of potentially controversial policing issues that could have been raised on the show. But Mr Afzal stepped down and appeared on the programme on 25 May. The APCC said: "Nazir told the board that he intended to go on Question Time to discuss the recent events in Manchester. "The board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah. "He resigned from his post in order to make this appearance. We thank him for his service during his year at the APCC." Mr Afzal joined the APCC last year. The association said Mr Afzal signed a contract confirming that he would not do any media without the consent of the board. This was essential because the APCC was apolitical and the role of the chief executive was politically restricted, it said. Mr Afzal tweeted: "Given media calls I confirm that I've resigned as Chief Executive of country's police & crime commissioners. I'm not saying anything publicly."

Three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, at East Cliff in Bournemouth. English Heritage strongly objected to the scale of the development in what is a designated conservation area. But, councillors voted seven to three in favour saying it would help tourism. Chair of the planning board and Conservative ward councillor David Kelsey, said the buildings earmarked for demolition were nice but no longer "necessarily functional". "They've come to the end of their working lives, we need to preserve the tourism aspect while improving living for older people in the town," he said. "The loss of buildings and trees are always regrettable but we can't stand still, we need to move forward." The site on Grove Road and East Overcliff Drive will get a 90-room hotel along with a nine-storey and seven-storey building, comprising 122 assisted-living apartments. Applicants The East Cliff Project LLP will demolish Bay View Court, The Cottonwood and the Ocean View hotels. The council received 246 letters supporting the plans. Forty-nine residents and the Ancient Monuments Society wrote to object to the demolition, stating that despite being altered, they still "give a sense of the historic character of the area". English Heritage said the scale of the development would cause "severe harm" to the conservation area.	A hotel and apartment complex in Dorset has been approved despite English Heritage stating it would be a "hammer-blow" to the area.
Healthcare workers are visibly struggling, the response to the outbreak has been damned as "lethally inadequate" and the situation is showing signs of getting considerably worse. The outbreak has been running all year, but the latest in a stream of worrying statistics shows 40% of all the deaths have been in just the past three weeks. So what can we expect in the months, and possibly years, to come? Crystal-ball gazing can be a dangerous affair, particularly as this is uncharted territory. Previous outbreaks have been rapidly contained, affecting just dozens of people; this one has already infected more than 3,900. But the first clues are in the current data. Dr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the difficult challenge of predicting what will happen next. He told the BBC: "We're quite worried, I have to say, about the latest data we've just gathered." Up until a couple of weeks ago, the outbreak was raging in Liberia especially close to the epicentre of the outbreak in Lofa County and in the capital Monrovia. However, the two other countries primarily hit by the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea, had been relatively stable. Numbers of new cases were not falling, but they were not soaring either. That is no longer true, with a surge in cases everywhere except some parts of rural Sierra Leone in the districts of Kenema and Kailahun. "In most other areas, cases and deaths appear to be rising. That came as a shock to me," said Dr Dye. The stories of healthcare workers being stretched beyond breaking point are countless. A lack of basic protective gear such as gloves has been widely reported. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has an isolation facility with 160 beds in Monrovia. But it says the queues are growing and they need another 800 beds to deal with the number of people who are already sick. This is not a scenario for containing an epidemic, but fuelling one. Dr Dye's tentative forecasts are grim: "At the moment we're seeing about 500 new cases each week. Those numbers appear to be increasing. "I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing. "The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse." The World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response. But the true potential of the outbreak is unknown and the WHO figure has been described to me as optimistic by some scientists. The outbreak started in Gueckedou in Guinea, on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. But it has spread significantly with the WHO reporting that "for the first time since the outbreak began" that the majority of cases in the past week were outside of that epicentre with the capital cities becoming major centres of Ebola. Additionally one person took the infection to Nigeria, where it has since spread in a small cluster and there has been an isolated case in Senegal. Prof Simon Hay, from the University of Oxford, will publish his scientific analysis of the changing face of Ebola outbreaks in the next week. He warns that as the total number of cases increases, so does the risk of international spread. He told me: "I think you're going to have more and more of these individual cases seeding into new areas, continued flows into Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and all the countries in between, so I'm not very optimistic at the moment that we're containing this epidemic." There is always the risk that one of these cases could arrive in Europe or North America. However, richer countries have the facilities to prevent an isolated case becoming an uncontrolled outbreak. The worry is that other African countries with poor resources would not cope and find themselves in a similar situation to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. "Nigeria is the one I look at with great concern. If things started to get out of control in Nigeria I really think that, because of its connectedness and size, that could be quite alarming," said Prof Hay. It is also unclear when this outbreak will be over. Officially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands. There have been nearly 4,000 cases so far, cases are increasing exponentially and there is a potentially vulnerable population in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in excess of 20 million. 11,315 Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected (Includes one in the US and six in Mali) 4,809 Liberia 3,955 Sierra Leone 2,536 Guinea 8 Nigeria Prof Neil Ferguson, the director of the UK Medical Research Council's centre for outbreak analysis and modelling at Imperial College London, is providing data analysis for the World Health Organization. He is convinced that the three countries will eventually get on top of the outbreak, but not without help from the rest of the world. "The authorities are completely overwhelmed. All the trends are the epidemic is increasing, it's still growing exponentially, so there's certainly no reason for optimism. "It is hard to make a long-term prognosis, but this is certainly something we'll be dealing with in 2015. "I can well imagine that unless there is a ramp-up of the response on the ground, we'll have flare-ups of cases for several months and possibly years." It is certainly a timeframe that could see an experimental Ebola vaccine, which began safety testing this week, being used on the front line. If the early trials are successful then healthcare workers could be vaccinated in November this year. But there are is also a fear being raised by some virologists that Ebola may never be contained. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, describes the situation as "desperate". His concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale. Ebola is thought to come from fruit bats; humans are not its preferred host. But like HIV and influenza, Ebola's genetic code is a strand of RNA. Think of RNA as the less stable cousin of DNA, which is where we keep our genetic information. It means Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting. Prof Ball argues: "It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why? "Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening." There is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception. Prof Ball said "it really wouldn't surprise me" if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended. "It is like HIV, which has been knocking away at human-to-human transmission for hundreds of years before eventually finding the right combo of beneficial mutations to spread through human populations." It is also easy to focus just on Ebola when the outbreak is having a much wider impact on these countries. The malaria season, which is generally in September and October in West Africa, is now starting. This will present a number of issues. Will there be capacity to treat patients with malaria? Will people infected with malaria seek treatment if the nearest hospital is rammed with suspected Ebola cases? How will healthcare workers cope when malaria and Ebola both present with similar symptoms. And that nervousness about the safety of Ebola-rife hospitals could damage care yet further. Will pregnant women go to hospital to give birth or stay at home where any complications could be more deadly. The collateral damage from Ebola is unlikely to be assessed until after the outbreak. No matter where you look there is not much cause for optimism. The biggest unknown in all of this is when there will be sufficient resources to properly tackle the outbreak. Prof Neil Ferguson concludes: "This summer has there have been many globally important news stories in Ukraine and the Middle East, but what we see unfolding in West Africa is a catastrophe to the population, killing thousands in the region now and we're seeing a breakdown of the fragile healthcare system. "So I think it needs to move up the political agenda rather more rapidly than it has."	This isn't just the worst single Ebola outbreak in history, it has now killed more than all the others combined.

The Canadian, 28, was picked as the Devils' forward of the year in 2016-17 after scoring 24 goals and 29 assists in 66 games. Haddad was a dominant force last season, playing the role of a power forward as Devils won the Elite League. "Joey Haddad was outstanding for us last season," said Devils player-coach Andrew Lord. "There were a number of games that he completely took over or broke open a game for us and that is what makes fans love him so much. "He is a big body and dominates in the corners and is tough to play against. "There were a number of teams that wanted him to make a move but he loves it here and I don't really think he entertained any other offers." Haddad will also be a vital part of Devils' Champions Hockey League campaign, with the Welsh side drawn in Group E against HC Davos from Switzerland, Bili Tygri Liberec of the Czech Republic and Sweden's Vaxjo Lakers.	Cardiff Devils attacker Joey Haddad has re-signed for a fourth season with the Elite League champions.
Tandridge District Council leader Martin Fisher gave planners a shortlist of five areas for such a scheme. He said one new Surrey village is better than "scatter-gunning" homes and cramping the current infrastructure. But Andrea Watson from Lingfield Parish Council said it will not solve infrastructure problems and there has been "poor local consultation". Areas around Godstone, Blindley Heath, Redhill Aerodrome, Chaldon and Lingfield are all in the running under the new Local Plan. The district is 94% greenbelt and Mr Fisher said the council cannot meet the government's housing targets without building on some of it. In January, the government announced Longcross as the site of one of 14 garden villages across the country. Councillor Fisher said: "The key is infrastructure. If you do the scattergun approach you may put 300 houses somewhere and that might deliver you half an extra classroom. "Whereas if you put 4,000 house in a new village you can actually plan the proper infrastructure in for the village [and] it's relieving the pressure on the health centres and the schools in other parts of the district." But Mrs Watson claimed most people interested in the new homes will be London commuters, where the most pressing housing shortage lies, and so "London needs to solve the problem it is now trying to devolve to us". She added: "The new settlement will not solve the infrastructure problems, and the infrastructure will not come until many houses have been built, if it comes at all." The site chosen will depend on which can deliver the best mix of able housing, infrastructure gains and highways opportunities.	Four thousand new homes could be built on greenbelt land in a new garden village development for Surrey.

The raiders drove into the Metro Bank branch at Babbage Gate, Oakgrove in Milton Keynes at 04:20 BST, police said. The cash machine was put in a dark 4x4, and the thieves drove off in that vehicle and a white VW Golf. Police are appealing for anyone with mobile phone footage of the raid to get in touch. Ray Cardy, who walked past the bank shortly after the raid, said: "The dumper truck had been driven through the front doors, turned round and smashed the ATM from behind. "The remains of it were on the footpath - the dumper's engine was still running." A Metro Bank spokeswoman declined to reveal how much money had been taken.	Four balaclava-clad men smashed a dumper truck into the front of a bank and escaped with its cash machine.

The aerodrome's owners had claimed that "permanent unrestricted planning permission" was granted in 1951. However, this was rejected by Waverley Borough Council in July 2011 and the planning inspector in April 2012. A judge at the High Court said the 1951 permission did not grant permission for unrestricted flying. Lord Justice Sullivan said the permission for "flight testing" did not amount to consent for unrestricted flying of aircraft. He said the certificate sought by the owners was pursued on the alleged basis that there was no material difference, in land use terms, between unrestricted numbers of passenger or cargo flights, and flight testing. He said: "The use of land as a bus station is not the same thing as use of land for the testing of buses." He added: "There can be no doubt that, properly construed, the 1951 planning permission does not permit the airfield to be used for unrestricted aviation activities." Dunsfold Park was constructed during World War Two by the Canadian Army. It is now used by about 100 commercial operators and most famously as the venue for the filming of Top Gear. The owners have the right to appeal the latest decision to the Supreme Court.	The owners of Dunsfold Park aerodrome, which is home to the BBC's Top Gear, have lost their latest fight for unrestricted flying.
The antiques, valued at between Â£2,000 and Â£3,000, were taken from Osterley Park House in Twickenham, south-west London, on 16 July. They were taken from a locked cabinet in a room that was closed to the public due to a wedding at the house. The pieces have images of Russian ruler Catherine the Great and Prussian king Frederick William II, and were made between 1770 and 1775. The cups and saucers, which are made of Berlin porcelain, are described as dark blue and painted 'en grisaille' with heavy gilding, flower sprays, finials and branch handles. Det Con Ray Swan, from the Mets Art's and Antiques Unit, said: "The cups and saucers are of significant historical value, we believe that whoever took them specifically targeted these pieces. "We would urge anyone who may know of their whereabouts to come forward as they may hold vital information to help us catch whoever was responsible for this burglary."	Two 300-year-old cups with saucers have been stolen from a country house.
The teams came head-to-head in the FA Cup quarter-final, with Chelsea winning the match 1-0. The action wasn't all on the pitch though. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte and Mourinho argued throughout the game, and had to be separated by the assistant referee at one point. Mourinho does, of course, have past history with Chelsea having been sacked by the club back in December 2015. He started his new job with United in May 2016. N'Golo Kante scored the only goal in the game. The victory means the Blues could still win the double of the league and FA Cup. The argument between the two bosses flared when United midfielder Ander Herrera was sent off for two yellow cards, leaving United to play for almost an hour with 10 men. Chelsea will now face Tottenham in the semi-final.	Chelsea boss Antonio Conte and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho argued during their match last night.
She died peacefully, aged 87, on Monday the 8th of April 2013. She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She believed that private companies would run the services better. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. The tiny islands eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic sea had been invaded by Argentina. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home. Read more: Tributes to Margaret Thatcher But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname "the Iron Lady" for being tough and sticking to her decisions. In 2012 a big movie was made of her life, called The Iron Lady. Was Lady Thatcher an inspiration to girls? After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century. Margaret Thatcher's life in pictures But eventually even her own party thought she had been in charge too long - and she left Downing Street in tears. Now, more than 20 years on, she is recognised as a prime minister who transformed the face of Britain - and will be remembered as one of the most important figures in modern British history.	Baroness Thatcher was the UK's first and only female prime minister.
Fo, whose plays include Accidental Death of an Anarchist and Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997. He was also known for Mistero Buffo, a one-man play he travelled the world with for 30 years. His plays often starred his actress wife Franca Rame. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a target himself of Fo's sharp wit, remembered him on Thursday as "one of the great protagonists of theatre, culture and the civic life of our country". He said: "His satire, his research, his work on set design, his multi-faceted artistic activity remain the legacy of a great Italian in the world." Born in March 1926 in Sangiano, a small town on Lake Maggiore, Fo learned the art of storytelling from his grandfather, a travelling salesman with a gift for spinning yarns. He was conscripted towards the end of World War II but managed to escape, spending the last months of the war hidden in an attic. Moving to Milan, Fo studied architecture before turning to writing and performing. After meeting Rame in the early 1950s, he achieved success with a series of monologues that led to his own show on Italian national radio. After establishing the Fo-Rame theatre company in 1957, Fo and his wife earned national recognition with a series of hit stage farces. But their work, often critical of the political establishment, led to battles with the censors and attempts at suppression. Dario Fo thought the long Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte - broad, even slapstick humour - could be used to comment on modern society. His work was filled with energy and political protest. He drew on the history of Italian theatre but became one of the most performed modern playwrights anywhere. His early material was gentle enough, but Fo later became a sharp-eyed satirist of the Italian state and corruption. For years he was banned from Italian TV for his irreverence. His radical politics meant he was twice prevented from entering the USA. Writers, among them Arthur Miller, protested at his exclusion. When Fo was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, the citation said he "emulated the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden". On stage, Dario Fo made serious political points by being comic. Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Fo's best-known play, was written in response to the real-life death of a political anarchist while in police custody. First performed in 1970, it went on to be staged in more than 40 countries. Fo, who was admitted to hospital earlier this month, had been due to give a talk in Edinburgh last weekend. Playwright David Greig paid tribute, saying Scottish theatre "owed a tremendous debt" to "an extraordinary theatre maker".

The oil firm said revenues in the year fell 27% to £1.6bn as the price of oil continued to fall in 2015. It is the second year in a row the oil company has reported a loss. In 2014, it reported a loss of £2bn. Tullow also warned there was a risk it could fail to comply with its financial covenants this year. Financial covenants are agreements that companies make with their lenders to maintain a stable financial position. Oil prices have slumped by 70% since the middle of 2014, with many of the oil majors cutting back investment on exploration and production. That has also led to the loss of more than 5,000 jobs in the North Sea oil industry. Tullow said it could cut annual capital expenditure to as low as $300m in 2017, down from $1.1bn planned for 2016, if market conditions did not improve. The firm said it had reduced headcount of 37% and was on track to deliver cash savings of around $500m over three years. It also said it would pay no dividend in 2015. Tullow Oil chief executive Aidan Heavey said: "Our challenge in 2016 is to be equally robust in responding to the uncertainties that remain in the sector." He added: ". As we look ahead, we have a portfolio of world class, low cost oil assets which will produce around 100,000 barrels per day in 2017 and  a major position in one of the world's newest, low cost, oil provinces in East Africa, both enabling us to create substantial value."	Oil and gas exploration firm Tullow Oil has reported a pre-tax loss of £1.3bn for the year to 31 December as low oil prices bit into revenues.
Ross-shire Engineering has secured the potential investment across the next five years supplying equipment to Scottish Water. The firm in Muir of Ord has already created 100 new jobs to allow it meet the needs of the utility company. The investment has also provided additional job security to the existing 273 staff members. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the company's premises near Inverness on Monday, following a tour of Nigg Energy Park on the Cromarty Firth. She said: "Ensuring a strong rural economy is crucial to Scotland's success. "This funding Ross-Shire Engineering has secured provides a hugely welcome boost in providing skilled jobs and investment across the Highlands, as well as providing vital utility services to Scotland's homes and businesses. "In particular, I am delighted they will be investing in their already strong apprenticeship job programme, providing vital training and employment to young people living in the Highlands in a competitive jobs market." The first minister added: "Last week when I set out my Programme for Government I promised to protect Scotland's interests, particularly our economic interests, in the wake of the EU referendum. "Driving sustainable economic growth is at the heart of that, and I am committed to ensuring this government does all it can to ensure Scotland's rural economy remains prosperous for future generations."	Funding of up to £200m has helped create new jobs at a Highlands engineering company.
According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed "the Cinderella cancer". "We just don't make enough of it" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. "On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. "What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour." But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. "It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer," says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. "That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. "The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery" says Prof Neal. "It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient".	It's a sobering thought for all us carriers of the Y chromosome, but prostate cancer kills almost as many men every year as breast cancer does women.
Charity Twelves Company, based in Devon, said it had turned away 112 people seeking support in 2015. A BBC investigation revealed that in Devon and Cornwall police have seen a 55% rise in reports of sexual abuse in the past four years. Police urged victims to come forward and said they would be protected. Updates on this story and more from Devon and Cornwall Between January and November 2015, 1,326 reports of sexual abuse were made to the force, compared with 853 in 2011. The figures show more than 380 historic allegations - in which the offence was committed before 1 May 2004 - of rape involving a child have been reported to the force since 2011. Jon Brown, head of development and impact at the NSPCC, said: "Unfortunately there is a significant gap between the number of people who need help and therapy as a result of the abuse, and the availability of services." He said the rise in reports was a result of historic cases of child sex abuse in the news, which had encouraged more people to come forward. 853 - 2011 888 - 2012 979 - 2013 1,221 - 2014 1,326 - 2015 Mr Brown said the prime minister had highlighted child sexual abuse as a priority along with dealing with terrorism which was "encouraging". However, Mr Brown said there needed to be a "more joined up approach [between authorities] to provide the provision of help for victims" including "greater treatment and help" and working with schools and families to prevent abuse. He said local authorities, health services and the police, as well as charities such as the NSPCC, had a duty to protect and care for victims. Tom Dingwall, chief executive of Twelves Company, which supports sexual and domestic abuse victims in the South West, said it provided services to almost 300 victims in 2015. "Last year, demand outstripped our capacity to deliver services and we turned away 112 adults from receiving specialist support." Across Devon and Cornwall there are four Local Safeguarding Children's Boards - which aim to protect those at risk. Andy Bickley, chair for Plymouth, said investments, including training courses for those who come into contact with children, have been made. David Taylor, the chair for Devon and Torbay, said authorities were "getting better at identifying abuse". He said: "It is an extremely complex and challenging area of work, and authorities in the region are learning from best practice in other parts of the country." Source: Devon and Cornwall Police Det Ch Insp Neil Ralph said the rise in reports of abuse was a "challenge for the police service, locally and nationally", but the force had made a "huge investment" by creating a dedicated unit and was working with other forces. "It is a large increase and we've increased our digital and online footprint as these things can be really difficult to report over the phone so it enables them to report abuse [online] much easier. "People have a high level of trust in the police and the Operation Yewtree impact [means] they have felt more compelled to report abuse to police. He said a high number of the reports, which were released in response to a freedom of information request by BBC News, related to historical crimes and the force "would do everything it can to investigate them and bring the offenders to justice". - Local authorities have the statutory responsibility for safeguarding children. - The safeguarding is overseen by Local Safeguarding Childrenâ€™s Boards. - These Boards are made up of a number of agencies such as local authorities, police, education & health providers. - Police will lead on criminal investigations with social care services leading on the safeguarding.	Victims of child sex abuse are being turned away from support services that are being overwhelmed by a large rise in cases.
The app samples wireless signals to see if data is flowing uninterrupted from routers to phones and tablets. The app is released alongside research which suggests wi-fi in six million homes and offices is not running as fast as it could do. The app also provides tips to help people spot what might be slowing down their wi-fi speed. Interference could come from other electronic devices such as baby monitors, microwaves or Christmas fairy lights, said Ofcom in a statement. Statistics about home wi-fi speeds are in Ofcom's 2015 Connected Nations report that looks at the state of telecoms and wireless networks in the UK. The report said there had been "good progress" on the availability and use of telecoms services. About 27% of UK homes now have super-fast broadband that runs at speeds in excess of 30 Megabits per second (Mbps). Last year the figure was 21%. Super-fast broadband is now available to more than 83% of UK homes - up from 75% in the same period in 2014. The research also found that those with the higher speed connections to the net are doing more with them. People with faster connections were now making significant use of catch-up TV services, online film rental services and video calls, it said. Much of the UK's appetite for data was being driven by households that have the super-fast services, said Ofcom. However, despite the growing use of high-speed broadband it also acknowledged there was "still more to do". The research found that 2.4 million UK homes, about 8%, cannot get speeds of 10Mbps or more. Many of these homes were in rural areas. It also said broadband speeds needed to increase for those on the move and said small businesses were being particularly poorly served when it came to access to services of 10Mbps or more. About half of all small or medium-sized firms based in business parks do not have access to net links of such speeds.	Christmas tree lights can slow your wi-fi warns watchdog Ofcom as it releases an app that can check home broadband.
Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired. People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the edge of the capital, with their eyes streaming. "Let the world see what is happening in this country," yelled one elderly man. "We will never stop until this... government goes." Ordinary Egyptians appear to be losing their fear of direct confrontation with the security forces. There have been bloody and drawn out clashes all over Cairo and in some of Egypt's main cities. They have a long list of grievances and the demands are an explicit challenge to their rulers. "We want a real democratic system. This regime of Hosni Mubarak has been in power for 30 years," declared Ahmed, a man in his 20s. "I was unemployed for five years. I had to move to the United Arab Emirates. This is what I was dragged into. My son will not suffer what I have suffered. This ends here." When you talk to people, they tell you economic reforms have not eased the poverty of Egypt's masses, education and social services are inadequate, and they complain of high levels of corruption and  political stagnation. "We are so furious. We must have change, better chances to work, to buy a flat and have just the life's basics," said a bank clerk clutching an Egyptian flag. "What happened in Tunisia has changed things a bit. It knocked some sense into people." Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei - who joined worshippers in Giza - was swiftly moved inside the gates of the mosque as clashes began. "One, two, ElBaradei where are you?" was the cry that then went up outside. Some expressed disappointment that the Nobel Laureate - who set up the National Association for Change opposition coalition when he returned home to Egypt a year ago - had not taken a more prominent role in protests. He has put up supportive messages on his Twitter account but was absent, in Vienna, for the first "Day of Rage" on Tuesday. He returned to Cairo on Thursday night. "I support ElBaradei, my father wants (Arab League Secretary General) Amr Musa," one man said. "We could have ElBaradei or anyone else," added Amgad, who had brought his young children along to witness the protest. "We need change, not any specific person." The main opposition movement, the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, subtly changed its message ahead of the latest protests. Despite the reported arrest of some senior figures, deputy leader Mahmoud Izzat spoke encouragingly of the protests. "People are demanding freedom, the dissolution of this invalid parliament. From the beginning this is what the young people have been shouting and we are with them," Mr Izzat told the al-Jazeera news channel. And he went on to criticise "the excessive force" of the security services. With multiple flashpoints across Egypt, many thousands of uniformed police, plain-clothed officers and paid thugs have been deployed. They line the bridges and main routes into central Cairo. While they remain strong and well-resourced, there have been unprecedented sights. In one case, a group of protesters tried to push an armoured vehicle into the River Nile. Attempts to close down mobile phone communications and access to Facebook, Twitter and Blackberrry messenger appear to have been ineffective in preventing the co-ordination of opposition activities. Demonstrators in the capital have simply regrouped in traditional gathering places downtown - such as Ramses Square and Tahrir Square. With Egyptians tuned into Arab satellite stations to watch dramatic scenes unfold, a curfew in Egypt's main cities was announced. However, as sirens blared on the darkening streets it was unclear how effective this will be.	"Go, go, Mubarak go" and "the people need to end this regime" shouted the angry crowds around al-Istiqamma mosque in Cairo's Giza Square, as they shook their fists at the lines of helmeted riot police after Friday prayers.
The Dundee-based company said shareholders had wanted changes to be made to improve performance. Chief financial officer Alan Trotter is to leave Alliance Trust, while chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox is to step down from the board. The financial services company's share price rose when trading opened following the announcement. Alliance Trust had been facing demands for a change in governance from US-based activist investor Elliott Advisers. The firm aims to simplify its structures and reduce costs by £6m per year by the end of 2016, although details of staff cuts or other efficiency measures have not been announced. Ms Garrett-Cox leaving the board means it now consists solely of non-executive directors, making it fully independent. In a letter to shareholders, chairman Karin Forseke said the changes would take effect "as soon as practicable", and no later than March 2016. She said: "The actions we have announced represent some of the biggest changes in our history, and are designed to further improve shareholder value. "Implementation will require considerable further work by the team, but we believe that as a result Alliance Trust will be significantly better positioned for the future." Managers at Alliance Trust, the venerable Dundee finance house, have been under siege for years. Having had to sue for peace earlier this year, the terms are now clearer, and they mean a radical change of direction. A cut in costs of 20% will feel painful at the Tayside headquarters. Non-core assets are being sold,  and new benchmarks are being set, with regular overviews to check how management of the fund performs against the market. They've been ahead of their benchmark since last year, but if they don't perform adequately in future, the board members brought on by activist investors will re-consider the decision not to contract out fund management to another company. The scale of the change to the Trust's strategy, and the clipping of senior executives' influence, by removing them from the board, is such that you might expect the resignations of chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox and/or chairwoman Karin Forseke. However, this follows consultation with the full range of shareholders, and the long-term smaller ones may see the current bosses as their best protection against short-term profit-taking. With lead activist investor Elliot Advisers upping its stake recently, this is an uneasy-looking settlement.	Investment firm Alliance Trust is to cut costs by £6m while restructuring its board to become fully independent.
A report due to go before the authority's cabinet on 15 July is proposing to make the cuts to cope with "a significant funding shortfall". The proposed cuts would see 195 job losses, 47 of those posts are already vacant according to the authority. The plans could also see the closure of Woodside Lodge care home and cuts to services for those with learning disabilities. A library review is also under way with a formal consultation for both service users and affected staff expected in the autumn. Deputy leader, Labour's Stephen Barnes-Andrews said: "We have a clear vision for where we want to be in 2017, but to get there we have to change the way we work and make some difficult decisions. "Any changes we make will be focused on delivering the best possible outcomes for our residents." The report highlights the likely gap that will be faced for 2015-16, is estimated at more than Â£30m. Councillor Royston Smith, leader of the Conservative group, said: "This announcement is betrayal. A betrayal of all those workers who were promised their jobs were safe with Labour and a betrayal to all those people who voted Labour after being promised services would be protected. "In two years in office Labour has refused to share services and accommodation, outsource to protect services and share management roles with other public sector bodies. "There is so much more that could have been done before sacking hundreds of workers, cutting support to disabled residents and closing care homes." In a statement, Unite described Mr Smith's claim of betrayal as "a joke" and said it was the government that was "betraying the people of Southampton by slashing funding, forcing councils to do their dirty work". It added it was opposed to any cuts that affect jobs and services to the vulnerable. "Job losses and outsourcing is not the answer," it said, adding: "If cuts carry on at this rate we fear there will be no council left by 2020." It added the joint unions had "defeated" cuts to the service in 2012 and would support campaigns against these new cuts.	Budget cuts at Southampton City Council could result in nearly 200 job losses.
The University of London's Institute of Education compared vocabulary test scores and reading habits of 9,400 British people born in 1970. The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. "In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from." But they also found "what people read mattered as how often they read". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But "tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed "the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16". The report also said: "Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers." The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred "highbrow" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.	Readers of tabloid papers have smaller vocabularies than people who do not read newspapers, suggests a study.
Jamieson followed his first-round 67 with a 65 on Friday, while Bjork has gone 65, 67 to leave both on 10 under. Home favourite Thomas Aiken bagged the round of the day, a nine-under-par 62 that took him to eight under overall. Glasgow-born Jamieson, 33, said: "It was very solid again from tee to green, like Thursday." Jamieson has spent the last two seasons battling to retain his playing privileges, finishing 106th and 107th in the Race to Dubai, but won his sole European Tour title in South Africa at the rain-shortened Nelson Mandela Championship in 2013. "I'm delighted with that today," the Scot added after his 65 at Pretoria Country Club. "I struggled a bit last week from tee to green but it seems to have clicked this week. Hopefully I can hole a few more putts this weekend. "The rough out there is pretty extreme but there's not a great deal of drivers (off the tee), which is probably suiting me right now because I struggled last week with my driver." England's James Morrison is a shot off the lead on nine under thanks to a second round of 66, with Scots Marc Warren, Richie Ramsay and Duncan Stewart in a share of 18th on four under thanks to second rounds of 67, 70 and 72. Fellow Scot David Drysdale is back on two under after a second round 68.	Scotland's Scott Jamieson shares the lead with Sweden's Alexander Bjork at the halfway stage of the Tshwane Open in South Africa.

The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12. The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher. Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school. The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children. Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call. "Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said. "Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape. "It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse. "Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help." The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance. The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem. One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me. "My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is. "I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much." Advice given by young people on dealing with bullying includes:	The number of children and young people needing counselling about online bullying has increased by 88% over five years, according to a helpline.
That's the prospect facing parents in Knowsley on Merseyside. If that was happening in green-wellied Oxfordshire or the sharp-elbowed London boroughs there would have been a storming of the barricades. Howls of anguish would be rattling the windows of the Department for Education. There would be outrage about university places. Parents would want to know why their children had to fight for places in other authorities. There would be warnings about social mobility going into reverse and a great leap backwards. But in Knowsley the last school in the borough offering A-levels is planning to shut down its sixth form. The governing body of Halewood Academy voted last month to close the sixth form, pending a consultation that finished at the weekend. The academy says that its current sixth form is financially unviable. It says that the break-even point is 155 sixth formers - and although in 2011-12 it had 157, since then the numbers have been below this level and as such it is no longer affordable. The academy is proposing to stop taking new sixth formers from this autumn, with the assumption that pupils could travel to schools in other authorities. Many Knowsley pupils already go to schools in neighbouring authorities for their post-16 education, but it depends on such schools having places available. The local authority says that as this is an academy, they can't intervene. "As an academy, it receives its funding direct from government and not from Knowsley council. "Whilst we, as the local authority, do work with all our local academies to help them improve education standards, as an academy the school is ultimately accountable to the regional school commissioner, and not the local council." Parents have set up a protest page on Facebook, with comments about how difficult it is to get a clear answer from anyone about what is going on. "Who is accountable? Nobody knows. Who do we get in touch with?" says Vanessa Pointon, a parent at the school. "This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well," she says. What kind of message does it send to young people to have no sixth forms offering A-levels? Knowsley already has among the lowest university entry rates in the country - and now young people are being told that none of their schools is even going to offer a single A-level. It is hard to think that since A-levels were introduced in the 1950s that there has ever been an authority where none of its schools offered the qualification. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: "It is important that young people have the opportunity to access a good choice of A-levels wherever they live. "For social mobility and access to Russell Group universities, this often means academic subjects like physics, chemistry, further maths and languages." Sir Peter said that despite funding challenges, it was "crucial" that "such choices aren't curtailed". The Knowsley example raises questions about how a future school system could operate where all schools are autonomous academies. If school decisions are outsourced to academy chains, who will provide an overview? There will be six secondary schools in Knowsley, a mix of academies and local authority schools, and if Halewood's proposal goes ahead, none of them would offer A-levels. Academy chains can operate across many different local authorities - and what works for them as a chain might not be the same as local interests. A Department for Education spokesman said ministers would be meeting MPs in Knowsley about the proposed sixth form closure. But the department says that if the school wants to push ahead with closure it will still have to be approved by education officials. "It must make the case to the Education Funding Agency and the regional schools commissioner that post-16 provision in the area would not be adversely affected by the closure before it can be given permission to close it." Does this mean that the Department for Education will be able to intervene? This is where things are far from clear. Regional schools commissioners, appointed by the government, are the officials responsible for overseeing academies. They can intervene if academies are underperforming or where their governance is weak. But can they force an academy, or academy chain, to change what it teaches or the age groups? It's a far-reaching question, because what if regional schools commissioners were allowed to intervene and decide on matters such as admissions policies? Could they subsidise a sixth form that an individual academy could not afford? Could they change how schools select or who they admit? It's a political balancing act, because if they are bystanders, they will be dismissed as pointless. If they're given powers to intervene, including in good and outstanding schools, they will be attacked as bureaucrats trampling on parents' rights. The Education Select Committee has warned of a lack of clarity about the role of the regional schools commissioner and that they risked being seen as "undemocratic and opaque". They heard evidence that nine out of 10 parents did not understand what commissioners were meant to be doing. "As we move towards a system of full academisation, the role of regional school commissioners will continue to grow and evolve," says the Department for Education. The government, setting out plans to compel all schools to become an academy, has called its White Paper "Educational Excellence Everywhere". But parents facing the prospect that none of their local schools will allow their children to take A-levels must wonder if "everywhere" means somewhere else.	How could there be an entire local authority in England where no pupil can take an A-level?
Up to a million people still needed to complete their tax credit renewals in the final week before the deadline. They would have received information about their annual review notice in a white A4 envelope, but they can renew online up until Sunday night. Separately, many of those in the self-assessment system must pay a tax bill. This so-called payment on account is the equivalent of half the previous year's tax bill, as an advance payment on their next bill. The other half is paid on 31 January. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) warned that anyone who failed to renew their tax credits could be in danger of having payments stopped, or find themselves paying more than they needed to. "It is great that millions of people have renewed their tax credits or reported changes so far, but anyone who has not done so yet should take action now - it only takes a few minutes to renew online," said Nick Lodge, of HMRC. Renewals can now also be completed via smartphone apps. The tax credit helpline - 0345 3003900 - is open until 20:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday. To renew, they will need their renewal pack, their National Insurance number, their and their partners total income for the tax year to April 2016, the 15-digit number on their renewal pack, and details of any changes to their circumstances, such as working hours and children. Claimants who received notices in a brown A5 envelope will see their tax credits renewed automatically and are only required to contact HMRC if they need to make any corrections or notify HMRC of any changes to household circumstances. Those whose notices came in a white A4 envelope must renew, even if their circumstances have not changed. The tax payment deadline affects everyone in the self-assessment system unless: There are various ways of paying but those leaving it to the weekend are likely to be limited to paying via online or telephone banking, or via the HMRC website using a debit or credit card. Interest is charged if the payment deadline is missed. After 28 days without payment, following the deadline, a surcharge is 5% of any unpaid tax is levied. This surcharge is repeated after six months. "This is a massive amount given the era of near zero interest rates," said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at ACCA accountancy body. An HMRC spokesman pointed out that there was some wriggle room for those who contact HMRC if they are struggling to pay the tax owed. "If a taxpayer can't pay and calls us before the due date and we agree a time to pay arrangement, they will not incur a surcharge," he said. "Our reasoning being the taxpayer is making an effort and it would not be fair to hit them with a surcharge, where a time to pay arrangement is in place." HMRC has been criticised by MPs and the National Audit Office for waiting times for those trying to call at key times, but the tax authority said the service had now improved.	Thousands of people face a deadline of the end of Sunday to renew tax credits and pay tax owed, or face losing payments or being hit with penalties.
The government said it wanted to ensure that militants with dual nationality who were fighting overseas could not return to Australia. The laws would also strip citizenship from dual nationals who engaged in terrorism inside Australia. The government said changes to the Australian Citizenship Act would be introduced to parliament on Wednesday. The new laws could be applied to up to half of the 120 Australians fighting in the Middle East with Islamic State (IS), said Prime Minister Tony Abbott. "The legislation will update the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to ensure dual nationals who serve or fight for terrorist groups, or engage in terrorism-related conduct inspired by terrorists groups, automatically lose their Australian citizenship," Mr Abbott said in a statement released on Tuesday. "The Act will also be amended to ensure dual nationals who are convicted of specified terrorism-related offences automatically lose their Australian citizenship," he said. Last month, the government said it would give the immigration minister the power to revoke citizenship in regards to terrorism activities but that option was attacked as unconstitutional by many legal experts. Mr Abbott said on Monday the new laws would not leave anyone stateless and did not exclude the role of the courts. "This will enable a person who has lost his or her citizenship to seek legal redress," Mr Abbott said. "If you are convicted of a terrorist offence, again, there will be an assumption that your Australian citizenship is forfeited, should you be a dual national." Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security will examine whether the law should be allowed to operate retrospectively. "Given that we have a number of dual citizens currently in jail after terrorist convictions, the committee should consider whether it should have retrospective operation at least in those cases," said Mr Abbott. He said another review would consider what to do with people engaged in terrorism who were solely Australian nationals.	Australia says it will reveal new laws stripping citizenship from dual nationals engaged in terrorism.
Media playback is not supported on this device The game ebbed and flowed, from the brilliance of Jos Buttler, to Sri Lanka slipping to 15-4, then the hitting of Angelo Mathews taking it to the final over. England know how destructive the competitive Mathews can be - he even scored half of his runs on one leg thanks to a problem with his left hamstring. However, he lost strike towards the end and, after Chris Jordan repeated his knack of bowling excellent yorkers at the death, Ben Stokes was able to defend 15 off the final over. In the end, England were good for their win. Eoin Morgan had the right men in the right places, they took pressure catches and, overall, they kept their cool. That, along with big players putting in big performances, is exactly what T20 cricket is about. In the case of Buttler, England have never had a player so destructive or capable of batting like he does. Media playback is not supported on this device The Lancashire wicketkeeper, who made 66 not out from 37 balls, has a whole range of shots that, when you first see them, appear so risky. However, Buttler has an amazing eye and he practises hard. He has established a technique that works for him, including flat-batted drives through the off side and flicks over his shoulder. He is a formidable opponent. Alongside him is Stokes, who made a serious contribution to such a big, important match. He hit the only ball he faced for six, ran out Lahiru Thirimanne with his first touch in the field, took a steepling catch to remove Chamara Kapugedera, then ensured Sri Lanka did not get the runs they needed off the final over. Earlier in the tournament, Joe Root hit that magnificent 44-ball 83 to lead the chase of 230 against South Africa when defeat would have almost certainly sent England out. On Saturday, he took a brilliant catch in the 19th over. These are key players who relish the biggest challenges and stand up when the going gets really tough. Now, England head to a semi-final, almost certainly against New Zealand on Wednesday, with the advantage of having played twice on this Delhi ground. Media playback is not supported on this device While the Kiwis, unbeaten in topping Group 2, have been relying on their spinners on slow pitches, England have been playing a different, more pace-influenced game. Even with that advantage, England will be the least fancied of the semi-finalists, regardless of who makes it through out of India and Australia on Sunday. But, as we have been saying all along in this tournament, no team has ever gone through an entire World T20 unbeaten and the eventual winners will be the side that peaks at the right time. The last four teams have only two games between them and the trophy. The semis and final will be incredibly difficult to predict because Twenty20 is hard to consistently play well - there's always a different area of your game coming under attack. England should at least be confident of giving a good account of themselves. They are happier chasing, but they have won two games batting first. If everything clicks, and they still have not played a match in this tournament where all departments have - against Sri Lanka the spinners went for a combined 63 runs in four overs - then they have a real chance. When it comes to the pressure moments in a Twenty20, all you can do is stay calm and try to remain in control, even if you are under the cosh. That is what England did against Sri Lanka and, if they can do it in two more matches, they have a chance of repeating the success of 2010.	The 10-run win over Sri Lanka that took England to the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 was a classic.
The judge also fined him 1m shekels ($289,000; Â£171,000) and ordered that 560,000 shekels in assets be seized. Olmert's lawyers said he was innocent and would appeal. If he is unsuccessful he will become the first former head of government in Israel to be jailed. The 68-year-old was convicted in March over a real estate deal that took place while he served as mayor of Jerusalem. The Tel Aviv District Court found he had accepted a 500,000-shekel ($145,000; Â£86,000) bribe from the developers of a controversial apartment complex, known as Holyland, for which planning and zoning laws were changed, and another 60,000 shekels for a separate project. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Jerusalem This jail sentence is a dramatic fall from grace for a man who was once one of the most powerful figures in Israel. It is also likely to end any hopes of a political comeback for Ehud Olmert. Recently, as he criticised the Israeli government's handling of peace talks with the Palestinians, it seemed he still held ambitions to return to public life. However, the judge in this case said that Olmert's crimes involved "moral turpitude", meaning he will be barred from office for seven years after serving his sentence. In his memoirs, Olmert claims he came very close to a peace deal with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in 2008. But in his three years in office he also took Israel into two bloody, armed conflicts - the 2006 war with the militant Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, and a three-week offensive on Gaza in 2008-2009 that left some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead. Now corruption has been added to Olmert's political record. However, many Israelis hope his sentencing is a sign that their country is cleaning up its political culture. Ten other government officials and businesspeople were convicted alongside Olmert. The sentences handed down on Tuesday against six of them ranged from three to seven years. Judge David Rozen said bribery offences "contaminate the public sector" and "cause the structure of government to collapse". He added: "People who receive bribes give rise to a feeling of disgust and cause the public to despise the state's institutions. The taker of bribes is like a traitor who betrays the public trust that was given to him - trust without which a proper public service cannot be maintained." The judge said Olmert had made a "large contribution to the country". But he described his offences as "noxious" and said he was guilty of "moral turpitude", which under Israeli law would preclude him from running for public office for seven years after finishing his jail term. Olmert reportedly stood quietly in the courtroom with his head bowed. His lawyers had sought a non-custodial sentence. The judge told him to report to prison on 1 September, effectively giving his lawyers time to lodge their planned appeal. "He did not take a bribe. He did not receive a bribe. He sees himself as innocent, and it is with those feelings that he will be going to the Supreme Court to appeal," Olmert's lawyer, Eli Zohar, told reporters. Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who served as Olmert's deputy prime minister and foreign minister said: "It is a difficult day when a former prime minister is sentenced." "I have complete trust in the court and law enforcement officials, and the public should as well." Olmert served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, until a flurry of corruption allegations led to his resignation. He was acquitted of most of the major charges eventually brought against him by prosecutors but was also found guilty of breach of trust and given a one-year suspended jail sentence. He was found to have made decision when he was minister of trade and industry that benefited clients of a close associate.	A court in Israel has sentenced former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to six years in prison for bribery.
More than 12,600 cases were discontinued from 2014 to 2015 - one in every eight Crown Court cases. At the same time, the proportion of Crown Court cases resulting in a conviction fell below the 80% mark for the first time since 2010-11. The CPS said cases were kept under "constant review". A study of the data suggested the principal reason for the fall in the proportion of cases resulting in conviction was because of the rise in the number that were dropped by the CPS after charges had been brought. The total number of cases dropped at that point was 12,615 last year - an increase of nearly 1,700 on the year before. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said: "In 70% of the dropped prosecutions, the CPS offered 'no evidence'. "In other words the case was discontinued at a late stage, after the defendant had pleaded not guilty, and often after many months awaiting trial." He added the figures "are likely to fuel claims that the criminal justice pendulum has swung too far in favour of victims and away from the accused". A CPS spokesman said: "All cases are kept under constant review as they progress through the criminal justice system. "If new evidence comes to light, a witness decides to no longer support a prosecution or a co-defendant pleads guilty to the offence, the CPS will then review the case. "If there is no longer sufficient evidence or if it is no longer in the public interest, the CPS will stop a prosecution." He added: "In 2014-15 the CPS offered no evidence in 8.8% per cent of cases. This compares to 8.3% the previous year and 9.4% the year before that." Nazir Afzal, former chief Crown prosecutor of the CPS for north west England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We have to ensure that we don't have the baying crowd mentality. "There are lots of people who are desperate for cases to be brought for all sorts of reasons. "A prosecutor must look at it in the cold light of day, professionally, ensure that they recognise any issues about the credibility of the allegation and make the decision that stands up." He added: "The accused person needs to have as much information given to him about what happened. That would not necessarily make life any better for him but certainly give an understanding that maybe, just maybe, the decision was right at the outset and something has changed."	The number and proportion of prosecutions dropped at Crown Courts in England and Wales has risen to its highest level in five years.
The U's led at half-time through Piero Mingoia but the game was transformed by goals from Shrimps pair Jack Dunn and Paul Mullin in the space of three minutes after the hour. Winger Mingoia opened the scoring nine minutes before the break, firing across Morecambe goalkeeper Barry Roche after the ball fell to him when Ben Williamson was unable to get a shot away. The visitors levelled in the 62nd minute when Dunn converted from the penalty spot after being brought down by Luke Berry. Dunn was involved again two minutes later, robbing Conor Newton and freeing Mullin down the middle, who rounded keeper Will Norris and fired beyond a man on the line. Medy Elito and Berry both fired wide as the hosts failed to find an equaliser, leaving them without a win in their opening eight league fixtures. Cambridge United manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "Until I'm told otherwise I'll be doing my job exactly the same as what I've been doing for the last 10 months. "It's been a job that I'm very proud to have. I've enjoyed some wonderful times here and I expect to enjoy some future wonderful times. "I'm a fighter. I feel like I'm in a little war at this moment in time, a war with myself as well as I hate seeing us at the bottom of the league. But I'm fighting." Report supplied by Press Association.

The woman, named in floral tributes as Kelly, was arrested on suspicion of assault in Darwen on Saturday and taken to Greenbank police station. After she was found "unresponsive" in her cell at about 01:30 GMT on Sunday, she was taken to hospital where she later died, Lancashire Police added. The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation. Flowers were left outside the police station to the woman who is yet to be formally named by police. A note on one of the bunches read: "To my beautiful daughter Kelly. "Love you, will always love you. "Will miss you greatly. Mum." An IPCC Spokesperson said it had begun an independent investigation following the death of a woman detained by Lancashire Constabulary. Investigators have begun to gather evidence, they added.	A 35-year-old woman has died in police custody in Blackburn.
The Women into Sustainable Employment scheme aims to improve language and workplace skills and is being piloted in Dundee and Glasgow. It is run by Bridges Programmes, which supports refugees, asylum seekers and others who do not speak English as a first language. If successful, the project could be extended across Scotland. The Scottish government said research suggested women from black and ethnic minority groups face many barriers to work and are under-represented in Scotland's labour market. Minister for Youth and Women's Employment, Annabelle Ewing, said: "This course is aimed at precisely that group of women and I am very pleased that the Scottish government is able to fund the programme in two of Scotland's cities to help improve their employability, including building up their confidence, sharpen their English language skills and experience the workplace itself. "We hope that if successful, such an innovative approach to the provision of English for speakers of other languages can be rolled out across Scotland to allow many more to benefit in the future. "We are committed both to strengthening the economy and reducing inequality in Scotland. Schemes such as Bridges will help us make progress on both fronts by helping a minority group take their rightful place in the workplace." Founder and director of the Bridges Programmes, Maggie Lennon, said "We are delighted that the Scottish government is funding what we know to be a successful and practical way of getting black and minority ethnic women into work. "The key to the approach is working closely with employers at every stage, to ensure that the training is relevant to their needs as well as the women, meaning work- placements are more successful which in turn can lead to more sustainable job outcomes. "Once again we see Scottish employers taking a pro-active role in supporting people far from the workplace."	A new project to help women from ethnic minority backgrounds into work has been given £110,000 of government funding.
He will make 19 speeches during his tour of Kenya, Uganda and the Central African Republic (CAR) and they will probably address these issues: He is expected to focus on religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence at a time of rising political instability and extremism in much of the region. Security is expected to be tight throughout the trip, as the faithful flock to see this popular Pope, who has previously said that Christians would be wrong to equate Islam with violence. His first stop, Kenya, has seen some of the worst Islamist violence: Two years ago, gunmen from the Somali militant group al-Shabab massacred at least 67 people inside Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall. In Uganda, his second stop, al-Shabab bombed sports bars in Kampala where fans were watching the 2010 football World Cup on TV. Many think the third stop on his trip, the CAR, is too dangerous for him to visit. The Pope's visit to the capital, Bangui, where many have died in violence between largely Muslim Seleka rebels and mainly Christian "anti-balaka" militias, is seen as his most dangerous yet - but potentially also one of his most fruitful as a peace-maker. In short: He will probably urge Christians and Muslims to get along. 2. Poverty This is a Pope who has been hailed as the champion of a church for the poor. His emphasis on the developing world, and the example of simplicity he sets in his own life, will be welcomed in countries where corruption in public life is often seen as an issue. His capacity to look beyond Europe and embrace the concerns of people around the world is also likely to endear him to the faithful, and to those of other faiths, as this Pope from the southern hemisphere offers a message of hope to the dispossessed, and the struggling. In Kenya, 75% of the wealth is owned by around 1% of the population, so Pope Francis's message may well prove popular among many of the remaining 99%. He is likely to criticise inequality and corruption and will visit Kenya's multi-ethnic Kangemi slum - home to around 100,000 people. In short: He will probably criticise corruption and inequality. With international climate change talks starting in Paris on 30 November, many will be listening closely to what Pope Francis has to say when he speaks in Nairobi to the UN's Environment Programme. His encyclical on the environment, "Laudato Si" published earlier this year, raised hackles among big business in the US with its apocalyptic warning that humankind risks turning the earth into a "vast pile of filth" by mistreating the planet. The Pope is unlikely to mince his words. He will probably emphasise the need for the developed world to stop abusing the planet for profit and to the detriment of the poor, whom he sees as the victims of climate change. In short: He will probably tell big business to think of the poor. LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activists, especially in Uganda, would like the Pope to encourage greater tolerance and speak out against the criminalisation of homosexuality in many African countries. In the past, when the Pope was asked about a gay priest he said, "Who am I to judge?" However, the recent Synod on the Family in Rome did not budge on the issue of greater acceptance within the Church for gay Catholics. Might he directly address the discrimination against gay and lesbian communities on a continent where being gay is often still a crime? Activists certainly hope so. They think it could make an enormous difference to attitudes in the continent. Attitudes like that of Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah who told the Synod that what Nazi and Communist ideology were to the 20th Century, so the twin "beasts" of "Western homosexual and abortion ideologies, and Islamic fanaticism" were for the 21st. In short: He is unlikely to lecture Africa on LGBT rights. The Pope once said that Catholics did not have to breed "like rabbits", before the Vatican clarified his remarks to insist that he was not speaking out against large families. However, many international aid agencies and some Western governments would like the Roman Catholic Church to give up its opposition to artificial contraception, especially its ban on the use of condoms, to help people on a continent where Aids/HIV remains a problem. Pope Francis is likely to meet people with HIV, but unlikely to budge on contraception. Large Catholic families are helping to ensure that Africa becomes an ever more important part of the Church. And the Synod on the Family in October reiterated the Church's hostility towards aid programmes that try to link development aid to the use of artificial contraception. In short: He is unlikely to scrap the Catholic ban on contraception. Five African countries with the most Catholics: 1. Democratic Republic of Congo: 31 million 2. Nigeria: 20 million 3. Tanzania: 14.2 million 4. Uganda: 14.1 million 5. Angola: 10.8 million Christianity is projected to be sub-Saharan Africa's largest religious group by 2050 with 1.1bn followers from 517 million in 2010. The Muslim population is expected to grow at faster rate, rising from 248 million to 670 million.

Hasbro, the maker of My Little Pony, approached Mattel about a deal late last year, according to Bloomberg news. The combination of the two toy-makers would produce a company with a $20bn market capitalization as of Wednesday. In 1996, Mattel made a $5.2bn (Â£3.5bn) offer to buy Hasbro, but the two sides failed to reach a final agreement. Over the last few years, Mattel has lost market share to Hasbro and Denmark's Lego. Lego overtook Mattel as the world's largest toy-marker in 2014. In its most recent quarter, Mattel reported a 4% drop in worldwide sales and expects sales to decline this year. That is partly because Hasbro has taken over the contract to produce toys based on the Disney movie Frozen, and toys sold under the Princess brand. Mattel estimated in 2014 that the Princess brand brought in $300m. In an effort to boost sales of its Barbie line, Mattel introduced three new body types and seven new skin tones in January. Sales of Barbie dolls fell 10% globally in 2015. Neither company has commented on the rumoured deal. Hasbro's share price rose 1.5%. In afternoon trading, Mattel shares fell back and were trading up 1.6% on the day. Hasbro reports its full-year earnings report on 8 February.	Shares in Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, jumped 8% on Thursday following a report it had discussed a merger with rival Hasbro.
It is the first time Wales' commissioners for children, older people, future generations and Welsh language will appear on stage together, at City Hall.

Officials said the 1.14 litre bottles of Bombay Sapphire London Dry Gin should have had 40% alcohol content by volume when the actual figure was 77%. They said the problem had been traced back to the production line. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said no illnesses associated with the gin had been reported. Drinks giant Bacardi, which distributes Bombay Sapphire, said the affected batch was believed to have only been sold in Canada. The province of Ontario was the first to remove the gin from stores before a nationwide recall was issued. "One batch was bottled before correct dilution to achieve the stated 40% alcohol content by volume," the Ontario Liquor Control Board said in a statement "As a result, the affected batch has alcohol content by volume of 77%." The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said the recalled gin should be thrown out or returned to the shop where it was bought. It is the second time this year that Canada has had to recall a brand of liquor because the alcohol content was too high. In March, bottles of Georgian Bay vodka were pulled from the shelves after inspectors found a batch with an alcohol content of 81% instead of the advertised 40%.	Bottles of a popular gin have been recalled across Canada after a batch was found to contain nearly twice the amount of advertised alcohol.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Scot, 29, dismantled the Raonic serve in a 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) victory to repeat his triumph of 2013 and claim a third Grand Slam title. Murray is the first British man to win multiple Wimbledon singles titles since Fred Perry in 1935. "I'm proud to have my hands on the trophy again," said Murray. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray gave a famously tearful speech after losing his first Wimbledon final against Roger Federer in 2012. Twelve months later, he finally ended Britain's 77-year wait for a male champion - and the chance to see him repeat the feat attracted huge attention. Spectators queued overnight just to grab a spot on Henman Hill, while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and former champions Bjorn Borg, Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker were among those watching from the Royal Box. "This is the most important tournament for me every year," added an emotional Murray. "I've had some great moments here, but also some tough losses. The win feels extra special because of the tough losses." Media playback is not supported on this device Murray was playing his 11th Grand Slam final and for the first time he was the favourite, having faced either Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer in the previous 10 finals. He appeared to relish the role, ignoring the magnitude of the occasion to claim a sixth successive win over Raonic. The 25-year-old Canadian was making his Grand Slam final debut, helped along the way by John McEnroe, who was in the opposite coaching corner to his old rival Ivan Lendl. Whatever insights those two legends were able to pass on, the final came down, as expected, to a contest between serve and return, with the latter coming out on top. Raonic went into the match with 137 aces, but it took him five games to add a 138th as Murray dialled in early on the return, just as he had in winning their Queen's Club final three weeks ago. A blustery wind on Centre Court was not helping the Raonic serve and he was under pressure early on, seeing off two break points before Murray converted a third to lead 4-3. That was enough to give the Scot the set and he continued to press in the second, earning four chances to break again but finding the net each time. Raonic was unable to respond, failing to conjure up a single break point, but a tie-break offered the Canadian a chance to serve his way back to level terms. Murray was having none of it, taking advantage of a slightly fortuitous early break to surge ahead with some magnificent defence and a rasping backhand winner. At 6-1 down, there was no way back for Raonic - and when Murray clinched his third set point even the implacable Lendl was moved to applaud. An unexpectedly routine contest came to life at the start of the third set when Raonic finally had two break points, only for a fired-up Murray to play his way out of trouble. The world number two pumped his fist and roared in the direction of his player box, and when it came down to another tie-break, Murray again found his very best when it counted. A brilliant backhand winner set him on the way to another 6-1 lead and, with the crowd chanting "Andy! Andy!", he pummelled a forehand into the corner on his second match point that Raonic could only return into the net. In his previous 10 Grand Slam finals, Murray had only won 67% of his first-serve points - but it was a different story against Raonic as he won 87% of the points behind it. He was not afraid to direct the majority of his serves to Raonic's strength, the forehand, and incredibly only lost one point when he did so in the match. In fact, over the course of both tie-breaks, Murray directed every first serve to the Raonic forehand. The fact Murray was able to hold so comfortably throughout the match - he only faced two break points - meant that he could be ultra aggressive when returning. He was able get 74% of his returns back in play and put pressure on the Raonic serve, which suffered under pressure, especially in the tie-break where the Canadian only won 44% of his service points. Murray's ability to continually return the huge Raonic serve proved key to his victory. The Canadian fired down the biggest serve of the tournament at 147mph, but it was still not enough, the Briton winning the point with a brilliant pass. "He moves incredibly well, he returns well - those are his two biggest strengths, and he's been playing well," said Raonic. "Every time you play him, you know he's going to get more returns back than anyone else, along with Novak." Media playback is not supported on this device Boris Becker, three-time Wimbledon champion: "Obviously, the big one is always the first one and once you break that duck there's room for more. He's 29, at the peak of his career, so I'm sure he's going to be up for a few more Grand Slams. "Grass is his most natural surface, and he's always going to be a big threat at Wimbledon. Hard court is a great surface for him too. He'll be winning a couple more." Lleyton Hewitt, 2002 Wimbledon champion: "Andy Murray is always trying to improve. It couldn't have been easy losing the Australian Open for a fifth time this year, and then losing to the one guy who's held the weight against him for so long in Novak Djokovic at the French Open, despite having taken the first set. "I'm really pleased for him. You do put so much into this, he will be so relieved now." Tim Henman, four-time semi-finalist: "Murray delivered in every aspect, it really was an amazing finish to a fantastic fortnight for him. He stamped his authority, got up 5-0 in both tie-breaks. His first serve percentage, he only made nine unforced errors... Murray used all his skills to keep making Raonic play and make life difficult and it paid off." Pat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion: "It was almost a faultless tournament from Andy. It was so special. He perhaps had one blip by losing a set against Tsonga. How often can you say that?"

Demba Ba leapt to put the Blues ahead with a deflected shot and Eden Hazard added a second before the break, following up when Ramires hit the bar. Saints created little until Rickie Lambert came off the bench to head home Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Jason Puncheon levelled when he smashed home Luke Shaw's cross and Southampton left with an unlikely draw. Media playback is not supported on this device Chelsea have now won only one out of six domestic games at Stamford Bridge under Benitez and, for the third successive home game, boos rang out at the final whistle. It was easy to understand the home fans' frustrations. This was a game that they seemingly had wrapped up at half-time despite missing several chances but they were rattled by Lambert's introduction and instant impact. Ba could have made sure of the points when he volleyed over in the second half but sloppy defending gave Puncheon room for his explosive finish, which leaves Chelsea 13 points behind leaders Manchester United, with 16 games left. Home: P6 W1 D3 L2 F10 A5 Away: P7 W6 D0 L1 F21 A7 Results in Premier League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup, not including World Club Championship or Champions League. It was only the third time in 90 home matches in the Premier League era that Chelsea had surrendered a 2-0 half-time lead, a slip particularly ill-timed from Benitez's point of view considering the news about Pep Guardiola earlier in the day. The announcement that the long-term Chelsea managerial target is to take charge of Bayern Munich next summer might have been bad news for Blues owner Roman Abramovich, but surely represents a window of opportunity for his interim boss. If Benitez is to stay for longer than the end of this campaign, then results will arguably matter more than the opinion of the fans who have opposed his appointment from the start. At the moment, both are going against him on home turf. Benitez has claimed this is down to the tactics of visiting teams rather than a reaction to the often abusive atmosphere but against Southampton it was poor finishing - and defending - that was to blame. Media playback is not supported on this device Chelsea were comfortable at the break, taking the lead through Ba's instinctive finish from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross and doubling it when Hazard impressively despatched a bouncing ball from the edge of the area after Ramires had struck the bar. But the home side were given a rude awakening when Saints' top scorer Lambert, left on the bench while his side looked to defend deep and counter-attack before half-time, was summoned for a rescue mission. It took Lambert, the leading English scorer in the top division, precisely two minutes and 47 seconds to announce his arrival in the game, powering home his header for his 10th goal of a productive campaign. Chelsea could still have made the points safe, with Ba missing the target completely after he ran on to Juan Mata's superbly clipped pass, but it was Saints who had the last word as they extended their unbeaten league run to five games. Shaw raided forward down the left flank and his cross was allowed to bounce across the edge of the area, where it was met by Puncheon to take a touch and fire a superb strike past the helpless Cech. Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez: "We should have won. "We didn't take our chances when we had them. We had situations where we could score. We didn't and they broke on a counter-attack. We gave them hope they could score and they did it. "I was talking to the team at half-time, trying to say 'we have to score a third goal'. "I think for us we cannot be happy drawing at home. I am disappointed. Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "We came with a game-plan to be compact and frustrate the opposition. "It was a big call to leave Rickie Lambert out but we wanted to make sure we were in the game. "At half-time it was 2-0 and I said, 'stick to the game-plan'. If we had gone and chased it there was every chance we could have ended up with a scoreline like Aston Villa, who conceded eight here. "We stuck at it. Rickie came on and scored the goal and what a fantastic goal it was for the second one. Full Time   The referee brings the game to a close. The referee blows for offside against Ashley Cole.

The agreement appears to bring to an end a bitter dispute between the coalition and the Afghan government. The troops and their Afghan counterparts have been accused of murder and intimidation in the area. Special forces and local police will now begin a phased withdrawal. Afghan security forces will then take over on a district-by-district basis. American special forces and the Afghan local police they have trained in Wardak have been accused of committing atrocities in the area, including the murder of nine men. Isaf has denied the allegations but President Hamid Karzai last month said they should withdraw within a fortnight. Relations between the president and Nato have been tense in recent weeks. On Tuesday the presidential spokesman described the Nato-led military operation in Afghanistan as "aimless and unwise". "We have come to agreement on a plan for Wardak that continues the transition of this critical province and meets the security needs of the people and the requirements of our mission," Isaf Commander Gen Joseph Dunford said. "Under the agreement, beginning with Nerkh District, which is currently secured by Afghan Local Police (ALP) aided by coalition forces, the Afghan government will soon move Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) into this area to provide security. "The arrival of the ANSF will preclude the need for ALP and coalition forces in this area. The remainder of the province will transition over time." The general said that the agreement reflected the "growing capacity and capability of the Afghan security forces to meet the security needs" of Afghanistan. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says that the agreement is short on specifics - no timetable has been reached on when the special forces will leave. But it does allow Mr Karzai to save face. Afghan defence ministry spokesman Gen Zahir Azimi said that the Afghan army "will take the lead" after international special forces withdraw from Nerkh district, "so this problem will be solved within a few days". However our correspondent says that it is far from certain that the already stretched Afghan special forces will be able to establish security in Wardak once Nato has left. Wardak is a critical province. Located near Kabul, it has been used as staging post for a number of large-scale attacks in the city and has been the recent focus of counter-insurgency operations. The accountability of US forces and local militia working with them has been a growing source of friction in Afghan-US relations. Wednesday's agreement comes against a backdrop of long-term negotiations over which foreign forces will remain in Afghanistan after Nato's exit in 2014. The bulk of Nato's 100,000 troops are due to leave by the end of that year.	An agreement has been reached between Nato and the Afghan government on the withdrawal of US special forces from Wardak province, alliance officials have announced.
The blaze at the former Pontins resort at Brixham destroyed the 42-acre site in June 2014. Rick Edwards, of Higher Green, South Brent, was given a 12-month jail term suspended for two years at Exeter Crown Court. The 20-year-old was also given a year's supervision order to prevent further offending. Prosecutor Gordon Richings said Edwards had lit a small piece of wallpaper and the flames had rapidly got out of control. He admitted in interview he started the blaze "for fun". "A report on the fire indicated the arcade area had been completely demolished and the pool area and former ballroom were also damaged," he said. Kevin Hopper, for the defendant, said his client had never intended to cause such a serious incident. Mr Richings said the fire increased the final cost of demolition because it made it more difficult to isolate and remove asbestos.	A man who set fire to a derelict holiday park "for fun" has been sentenced.
The cabinet considered an urgent report on Tuesday and voted to remove the section from the pavilion to the seaward end. The report said because of the risk of further collapse, the council could not wait for consent to begin work, as is usually the case for a listed building. Work on the "dangerous" structure is expected to take about three weeks. Parts of the Grade ll pier, which was already closed to the public when it gave way on 1 February, will be saved, catalogued and stored. Iwan Davies, chief executive of the council, told the meeting: "The dangerous nature of the structure means dismantling it is dangerous." Up to Â£650,000 has been set aside for the work but councillors were told there was no way of knowing how much it would cost.	Part of Colwyn Bay pier is to be dismantled after it collapsed into the sea, Conwy council has decided.
He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a "guiding example" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an "important landmark", adding the monarch had served the nation with "dignity". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: "The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be." The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as "work-shy William". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. "I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role," he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a "work shy" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised "but it's not something I take completely to heart". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was "the best role model I could have in front of me". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday "does not warrant this kind of coverage" and that the BBC had a "duty to report, not to celebrate the royals". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had "failed completely" to report the birthday in a way that was "fair, balanced and proportionate".	Prince William has answered criticism of his commitment to royal duties, saying he is willing to take on more responsibility when the time comes.
The incident took place close to Caernarfon's Crown Court and fire station just before 09:00 BST on Thursday. The mother-of-five was airlifted to hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. North Wales Police has said her 46-year-old partner has been arrested. "This is being treated as a domestic-related crime but I would like to reassure the community that a swift arrest was made," said Det Chf Insp Iestyn Davies. The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called at 09:00 BST to reports that a woman had been assaulted. Police said the victim remains in a serious but stable condition. Forensic investigations are being carried out at the location, which links nearby estates to a local primary and secondary school.	A mother walking her children to school in north Wales is in hospital with serious injuries after being attacked on a busy footpath.
Beate Zschaepe, 38, is accused of being part of the National Socialist Underground (NSU), which killed 10 people, most of them of Turkish origin. She denies the murder charges. Critics say the police made serious errors. The judge later adjourned the trial for a week after the defence team accused the judge of bias. After entering court, Ms Zschaepe stood with folded arms and turned her back on the camera. Her lawyers lodged a legal complaint with the judge, accusing him of bias. They complained about being searched for possible weapons or other objects on arrival, while prosecutors and police were not. The judge ordered an adjournment until 14 May to consider the complaint. The NSU case sparked controversy as police wrongly blamed the Turkish mafia before discovering the far-right cell. The head of Germany's domestic intelligence service was eventually forced to resign over the scandal. It also emerged that intelligence files on far-right extremists were destroyed after the cell's activities came to light. Four male defendants are also on trial with Ms Zschaepe, facing lesser charges of having helped the NSU. She faces life in prison if convicted. Critics have accused authorities of turning a blind eye to the crimes of right-wing extremists, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from Munich. Officials deny this, saying mistakes occurred because the murders were spread across different regions, each with different police and security agencies. The killings took place over a seven-year period, and none of the victims or locations was high-profile. Ethnic Turkish community groups and anti-racism campaigners demonstrated outside the courthouse on Monday, demanding justice. Some suspect the police of institutional racism which may have helped the neo-Nazis to act with impunity, our correspondent says. Before the trial got under way a large crowd of journalists had gathered outside, along with dozens of people hoping to get seats in the court. About 500 police officers were deployed and nearby streets were cordoned off. Ms Zschaepe, as a founding member of the NSU, is charged with complicity in the murders of eight ethnic Turks, a  Greek immigrant and a German policewoman between 2000 and 2007. She is also accused of involvement in 15 armed robberies, of arson, and of attempted murder via two bomb attacks. Prosecutors say the aim of the execution-style killings was to spread fear among immigrants and prompt them to leave Germany. Her lawyers say she is refusing to speak in court. Only the trial opening was broadcast, in line with German legal restrictions. The four male defendants are: The NSU cell remained undetected until Ms Zschaepe gave herself up in November 2011, after police discovered the bodies of two of her alleged accomplices. Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, appeared to have shot themselves after a botched bank robbery. After their deaths, the gun used in the murders of the 10 people was discovered. Ms Zschaepe shared a flat in Zwickau, in the old East Germany, with the two men who were found shot dead. The arson charge against her relates to a fire which she is alleged to have started in the flat before giving herself up. She told police she was the one they were looking for. In addition, a video emerged showing pictures of the corpses of the victims and identifying the "organisation" behind the murders as the NSU. The video had a cartoon Pink Panther totting up the number of dead. Only then did the authorities conclude that the killings were the work of neo-Nazis. They had previously treated some of the families of the victims as suspects in their murders. As a result, the trial has taken on a meaning beyond the charges in court, as it is also puts the spotlight on attitudes towards the murder of members of ethnic minority groups, our correspondent says. An earlier start date had been set for the trial, but it was delayed for weeks amid a dispute about the seat allocations, as Turkish media were not guaranteed places. Turkish media have now been given four seats, but several leading German newspapers missed out in the lottery, AFP news agency reports.	An alleged member of a German neo-Nazi cell has gone on trial in Munich in connection with a series of racially motivated murders.
Luke Gale put Tigers ahead, grounding a loose ball after Salford failed to handle a high kick. Murdoch-Masila's try reduced the deficit to two as Gareth O'Brien missed the conversion, but Greg Minkin powered over to extend Castleford's lead. Murdoch-Masila scored his second try to get Salford within two points, before O'Brien's penalty and drop-goal won it. Castleford had been top of Super League before the game after winning their opening four matches, but Wigan's draw with Huddersfield means they fall to second in the table. Tigers are the leading scorers in the competition this season, but they struggled to break down a resilient Salford defence. O'Brien missed his first attempt at a drop-goal, but Castleford knocked on from the restart to allow the former Tigers loanee a second effort. His kick earned Salford their third win of the season, taking them up to fifth in the early table. Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester: "I just thought our team mentality and our group unity in what we set out to do this week was brilliant. "I thought our middles were phenomenal, they controlled our pack. "He [Ben Murdoch-Masila] is a tough kid and he's a great player as well, we just need to get him up fully fit now and get him running properly." Castleford head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds: "I'm disappointed, it was a poor performance. "It was a tight game, conditions dictated a fair bit, but I thought we just went into ourselves way too much in the second half. "It was just one of those games where we just couldn't quite get going, but I thought they played really well. "If we'd have got a draw at the end it would have probably been a travesty, I thought they deserved to win the game." Salford: O'Brien; Johnson, Welham, Sa'u, J Carney; Lui, Dobson; Walne, Tomkins, Mossop, Murdoch-Masila, Griffin, Flanagan. Replacements: Brining, Krasniqi, Lopczak, T Carney. Castleford: Hardaker, Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden; Roberts, Gale; Lynch, McShane, Massey, Sene-Lefao, McMeeken, Milner. Replacements: Millington, Moores, Cook, Springer.	Ben Murdoch-Masila scored two tries as Salford fought back to end Castleford Tigers' unbeaten start to the season.
GB Taekwondo have overlooked the world number one three times in favour of Muhammad, ranked 59th in the world. The move has been investigated by the BOA and, while they feel selectors acted properly, they were disappointed by the way the issue has been handled. "There are two world-class athletes directly impacted by this nomination," read a statement issued by the BOA. "Our panel would have preferred to see the selection process managed in a manner that would have been of much greater service to both athletes. Overturning the selection made by a national federation would have been an unprecedented decision for the BOA. They asked GB Taekwondo to reconsider their choice of Lutalo Muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name, and, satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed, the BOA didn't have much choice. That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand. "That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination." GB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision. Performance director Gary Hall said: "This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions." Cook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action. "Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision," said his agent Jamie Cunningham. "He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association. "He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights. What more could Aaron have done? "We urge the World Taekwondo Federation to consider the ramifications of this flawed decision. Aaron will be considering whether he wishes to pursue a legal route to contest this decision over the weekend." Bob Mitchell, solicitor at Harbottle & Lewis representing Aaron Cook, added: "Everyone is extremely disappointed by the outcome today. We have retained a leading sports QC and will be deciding over the weekend what the best way is to proceed for Aaron from a legal and sports perspective. A further statement is likely to be issued early next week." The BOA's Olympic Qualification Standards panel can only accept or reject athlete nominations - it is not within its remit to select individual athletes. However, the BOA noted the importance of working closer with national governing bodies over selection policies for future Games. The panel added it reserves the right to reconsider the nomination subject to an ongoing inquiry by the World Taekwondo Federation.	The British Olympic Association has ratified Lutalo Muhammad's nomination for London 2012 ahead of Aaron Cook.
Crews battled the fire in Littleborough, Rochdale, for several hours after it was reported shortly before 19:30 BST on Wednesday. Engines from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service attended, with back-up from West Yorkshire. Firefighters remained at the scene until after 05:30 BST and the cause remains under investigation.	About 50 firefighters tackled a large blaze at a five-storey disused mill in Greater Manchester.
The Czech-born American helped Murray win Olympic gold, the US Open and Wimbledon before they parted in March. Lendl, 54, could not commit to the amount of travelling required but sees himself returning at some stage. "I've had a lot of enquiries," he told BBC Sport. "Eventually, when the time and situation are right, I enjoyed it enough that I will do it again." Lendl, a former world number one and eight-time Grand Slam champion, admitted the travelling issue was the main drawback to taking up another role. "There are so many things to coaching which I don't enjoy: the travel, the airports, being on the road for so long," he said. "I don't like doing anything in half-measures, so in order to do it properly it takes a lot of time. That's the hardest part." Tomas Berdych, the world number seven from the Czech Republic, spoke last week about his wish to work with Lendl. "I think it's something which I was thinking about, definitely," said Berdych. "I think it just needs probably the right time and timing to make it happen. Let's see. I hope for the time it's going to come up. Fingers crossed." Lendl met Murray and his team in New York a few days before the start of the US Open, in which the Briton went on to reach the quarter-finals before losing to top seed Novak Djokovic. "I think Andy needs to win some matches to get some confidence, that's the key there," said Lendl. Asked about his time with the Scot, he added: "I enjoyed it. It obviously was difficult at times in terms of travel, which I don't like doing, but I'm really glad that we got together and that Andy had the success he had. Media playback is not supported on this device "I'm very proud to be a little part of that." The success of their partnership sparked a trend in men's tennis for famous names of the past to return as coaches. Saturday's US Open semi-finals saw Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Michael Chang and Goran Ivanisevic in the four coaching corners. "I don't think that it's a coincidence, I really don't," said Lendl. "I always felt that one of the biggest attributes of Tony Roche coaching me for 10 years, what he was giving me was the knowledge of what it feels like to be on that Centre Court on Sunday afternoon. "He has done all four of them, been in all four finals. I don't care how good a coach you are, it's very difficult without having done it yourself. "It's so different walking out there on Sunday or Monday for the finals, and even the semi-finals, if you have someone you can talk to about your feelings."	Ivan Lendl says he is "proud" of his work with Andy Murray and expects to return to coaching in the future.
Lee Radford's side crossed eight times as they thrashed Salford at home in their opening match of the season. Fetuli Talanoa touched down twice in France, adding to scores from Sika Manu, Josh Bowden, Jack Logan, Jamie Shaul and captain Gareth Ellis. Winger Pat Richards scored all 10 of Catalans' points in the first half. Media playback is not supported on this device The Dragons have lost their first two games of the campaign and such a heavy home defeat early in the season will be a concern, with much of their success in recent years being based on a formidable home record. Hull top the table ahead of Wigan, with both sides starting the campaign with two victories. Former England international Ellis was making his first appearance for the Black and Whites since July after recovering from a serious Achilles injury. Catalans Dragons: Gigot; Yaha, Inu, Duport, Richards; Carney, Myler; Anderson, Pelissier, Bousquet, Stewart, Horo, Baitieri. Replacements: Taylor, Mounis, Bosc, Elima. Hull FC: Shaul; Michaels, Logan, Tuimavave, Talanoa; Pryce, Sneyd; Taylor, Houghton, Watts, Minichiello, Manu, Thompson. Replacements: Pritchard, Ellis, Bowden, Washbrook. Referee: Robert Hicks	Hull FC secured a second convincing Super League win in succession, scoring seven tries in a stunning victory against Catalans Dragons in Perpignan.
Rosberg was 0.275 seconds quicker than Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, with the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo close behind. Hamilton failed to complete a clean lap on his qualifying simulation on the ultra-soft tyres and ended up seventh. He finished his session early because of a recurring hydraulic problem. Hamilton was unable to do any of the race-simulation runs the teams do in the second part of the session on heavy fuel loads. He was also unhappy with the balance of the car on the ultra-soft tyre that was used for the fastest runs, although Mercedes believe they should be able to solve that problem with set-up changes. Hamilton, who is two points ahead of Rosberg in the world championship, is nevertheless heading into the weekend at a disadvantage. However, he can console himself with the knowledge that he had been fastest of all after the first runs in the session were complete, before he started to run into difficulties. "We had a small hydraulic issue at the end of FP2 but it doesn't look like anything serious," said Hamilton. "The guys are working on it and it should be fine for tomorrow, which is the main thing." Media playback is not supported on this device The evidence of the day was that Mercedes are not struggling in the same way as they did last year in Singapore, when their previously dominant car was more than a second off the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull. Listen again: A look ahead to the Singapore Grand Prix But, considering the long 3.15-mile lap, the margin between the world champions and their closest challengers is much smaller than normal. Verstappen was 0.380secs off Rosberg's pace, with Ricciardo just 0.025secs further adrift after recovering from a spin during which he brushed the wall without major damage. Verstappen was running a Renault engine upgrade which will not be available to Ricciardo until Saturday and which team boss Christian Horner said was expected to be worth in the region of 0.1secs a lap. And on race pace, Red Bull appeared to have an advantage but the picture was not completely clear. "We knew they wouldn't have a massive gap here this weekend," said Ricciardo. "We know if we get it right we can be very close in qualifying." Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was fifth quickest after an unconvincing qualifying simulation run, 0.7secs slower than Raikkonen and a second slower than Rosberg. Vettel's problems put him back in the mix with the midfield runners, headed by Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in sixth. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was eighth, ahead of Fernando Alonso's McLaren, a position with which the former champions are likely to be a little disappointed. They expected to be battling for seventh behind the big three, but Alonso was 0.6secs slower than Hulkenberg. The Spaniard's team-mate Jenson Button, meanwhile, was struggling - he was three places and a whopping 0.795secs behind Alonso, who is admittedly at his absolute best around the challenging Singapore track. Alonso had to park his car on track at the end of the session after encountering a gearbox problem. Englishman Jolyon Palmer was 17th fastest, just 0.005secs behind Renault team-mate Kevin Magnussen as both men fight for their future in F1.

It is likely to include a scrappage scheme for older diesel cars in areas with high levels of dirty air. Speed bumps could be removed in some cities to cut pollution from cars slowing down and speeding up. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth said they would "thoroughly analyse" the proposals. According to the Royal College of Physicians, air pollution across the UK is linked to around 40,000 premature deaths every year. The UK has struggled to keep within EU limits on some pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is produced by diesel engines and is linked to a range of respiratory diseases including asthma. Some 37 of the 43 regions of the UK are in breach of NO2 limits. Under earlier government plans, some parts of the UK would not have met EU NO2 standards until 2030. The original deadline to achieve these limits was 2010. Exasperated by what they believed was government foot-dragging on the question of cleaner air, ClientEarth mounted a legal challenge to force faster action. In April 2015, the UK Supreme Court ruled the government had to take immediate steps on the issue. Unhappy with the timescales in the plan that was then produced, ClientEarth went to the High Court last November for a judicial review. Once again the court supported the lawyers, telling the government that its scheme was "woefully inadequate" and giving ministers until 24 April this year to produce a new draft. With a general election in the offing, the government last week asked the judge for permission to delay the draft plan. But Mr Justice Garnham disagreed and ordered publication by 9 May. "These steps are necessary in order to safeguard public health," he said. Earlier this week, the government said it would not appeal against the ruling and would publish. In their previous plans, ministers wanted to create "clean air zones" in five cities outside London with high levels of NO2. Only the most polluting vehicles would have to pay a charge to enter the zone under that scheme. The new draft plan is expected to create many more such zones. Councils will be given the power to impose fines or restrictions on all polluting vehicles in these areas. In the worst cities, so called "toxin taxes" could range up to Â£20 a day but the government is said to be keen not to punish drivers who bought diesels as a result of incentives brought in by a previous Labour administration. This is something that the lawyers at ClientEarth support. "Successive governments have encouraged people to buy diesel. We don't want to see diesel drivers vilified, and we think the plans should also include properly funded incentives to help people move to cleaner forms of transport," said ClientEarth CEO James Thornton. "We will thoroughly analyse the government's draft plans when they are produced. If we do not think they are in line with the court order, to deal with illegal levels of pollution as soon as possible, then we will consider our next steps." According to newspaper reports, the government has agreed to back a "targeted" scrappage scheme for older diesel cars, but limited to vehicles in areas of high pollution. There may also be funding for a retrofitting scheme to help existing diesel car and van owners cut their emissions of NO2. The government is also said to be pushing for councils to use alternatives to charging, including the removal of speed bumps in some places and the better sequencing of traffic lights in others. Both of these measures could limit cars having to slow down and speed up repeatedly, actions that can almost double the amount of NO2 produced. However, the idea that speed bumps which slow down traffic would be sacrificed to help clean up the air we breathe is not a welcome concept according to road safety charity Brake. "We ought not to be made to choose between having cleaner air and safer roads," a spokesman said. "The evidence shows that air pollution is contributing to the early deaths of thousands of people. It's now clear that there's more than one way a car can kill you." The new proposals will be out for consultation for six weeks before the government produces a final plan at the end of July. Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook.	The UK government is set to publish a draft air pollution plan after a protracted legal battle with environmental campaigners.
Keith Baker, 60, and his wife Caroline, 54, had previously denied the charges. Baker, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, admitted the rape and assault of the woman over an eight-year period. His wife admitted she helped him and indecently assaulted the woman herself. Two charges of false imprisonment were left on the books. The court had previously heard that the couple kept her prisoner in squalid conditions in what was described as a "house of horrors". The couple will be sentenced on 2 December. Caroline Baker was released on continuous bail while her husband was remanded back into custody.	A husband and wife from County Armagh have admitted a number of sex offences, including the rape and assault of a woman with severe learning difficulties.
However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation. In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy. A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks. These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation. Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history. In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member. Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India. The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority. Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society. There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans. Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing. Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.	The 800-plus volcanic and coral islands that make up the Pacific nation of Fiji enjoy a tropical climate and host a significant tourism industry.
The neighbours entered the burning property in Milford Drive, on Sunday afternoon in an attempt to rescue two cats, police said. The occupants were not home at the time. The women had inhaled smoke and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. The cats were unharmed. Fire destroyed the front door and caused heavy smoke damage to the house. Dorset Police said it believed the fire had been started deliberately through the cat flap in the front door of the property at about 15:00 BST. Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with CCTV to get in touch. Det Con Luke Davis said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity near to the property during that afternoon, particularly anyone seen in the garden or the front drive of the property just before 3pm, to please contact me. "If you have any information about the cause or motive of the fire, please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."	Two women have been rescued following a suspected arson attack on a house in Bournemouth.
Evidence of suspected match-fixing in elite tennis was revealed this week by a BBC and BuzzFeed News investigation. "Future players will see the headlines and see it's not an option at all," doubles representative Fleming told BBC Scotland on Wednesday. "I think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again." Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco. "The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch," he added. "You never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that. "I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there." The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. "Your guess is as good as mine," he said of those involved. "There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. "It can just be people throwing money on a match." Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne. "I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre," he said. "Players going at it and the best player winning on that day. There's no doubt in my mind that is the case here."	Great Britain's Colin Fleming says tennis players guilty of match-fixing should face life bans.
The Wasps player-manager has been named League One manager of the month for February after three wins and a draw and his side sit second from top. "Since I took myself out of the team we've started playing well," he told league sponsor Ladbrokes. "I was finding it difficult at the beginning to do both. I wasn't giving 100% to either role." But the 35-year-old midfielder, who took charge in October after Jack Ross moved to Goodwin's former club, St Mirren, is not ending his playing career just yet. "I'm not making an official announcement that I'm retiring," said Goodwin, whose side sit second in the table and look certainties for at least a promotion play-off place. "I still keep myself fit and train with the boys twice a week and, if needs must, if we get a number of suspensions and injuries between now and the end of the season, I want to be able to play. "At this moment in time, the lads who are in my position are playing extremely well and I couldn't justify playing myself. "I felt it was better for me if I was going to give the opportunity the best crack then I should take myself out of the playing side of it, which has benefitted me greatly. "I'm now able to see the bigger picture from the side of the park and able to have more of an influence on tactical decisions and substitutions." Alloa began the month with a 2-2 draw at home to leaders Livingston and have since narrowed the gap at the top to seven points with nine games left. "At one stage, they had a 12-point gap and people probably looked at it and thought it was impossible for us to catch them," said Goodwin. "But we never believed that it was over and still don't to this day. "They're certainly in the driving seat, it's their's to lose, but if they're going to win the league then they'll have to go and get it. We won't hand it to them. "If they go and lose on Saturday and we win then it's down to four and we have to play each other."	Jim Goodwin has put Alloa Athletic's turnaround in form down to his decision to drop himself.
Tynan, a former Manchester City player, died after being hit by a train at West Allerton station in Merseyside on Tuesday, British Transport Police said. Tynan's death is not being treated as suspicious. Her family paid tribute to a "vibrant, generous and fun-loving girl", who was "a dedicated athlete, never happier than when she had a ball at her feet". Tynan began her career at Liverpool Feds, spent six years at Everton's Centre of Excellence and was playing for Women's Premier League side Fylde Ladies. A family statement also said she was a "the most loving and caring daughter and sister anyone could wish for" and that she was the "ultimate team player". It added: "Zoe always knew how to cheer anyone up, and was a loyal, straight-talking friend to many. She touched so many people's lives and will never be forgotten." Tynan joined Manchester City in 2015, making one Women's FA Cup appearance before moving to Fylde. Floral tributes have been left at the scene, according to the Liverpool Echo. England internationals including Lucy Bronze and Casey Stoney have also paid tribute. Fylde manager Luke Swindlehurst said: "We want to remember Zoe in the best possible way: a hugely talented player and an immensely likable character." Tynan had appeared for England at various youth levels and was recently included in the Under-19 squad for a training camp at St George's Park. The Football Association said it was "deeply saddened" by the death and Tynan's Under-19 coach Mo Marley described her as a "hugely-liked and popular member of the team".	England Under-19 Women's and Fylde Ladies midfielder Zoe Tynan has died, aged 18.
The private service is at Althorp House in Northamptonshire on Saturday, which would have been her 56th birthday. Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Princess Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, and her two sisters will also be there. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will be in Canada. The service will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris, when the Duke of Cambridge was 15 and his brother was 12. The princes have commissioned a statue of Princess Diana to mark the 20th anniversary of her death. The sculpture will be placed in the public grounds of her former residence, Kensington Palace.	The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are to attend a service to rededicate the grave of Diana, Princess of Wales, almost 20 years after her death.
Panthers kept alive their title hopes and closed the gap on leaders Devils to four points. Two goals from Matthew Myers put Panthers in control before Joey Martin replied. Franklin MacDonald, Geoff Waugh and Evan Mosey's two goals secured the win. The sides meet again in the Challenge Cup final at the Sheffield Arena on Sunday.	Cardiff Devils lost 6-1 away to Nottingham Panthers in the Elite League, less than 48 hours before playing the same opposition in the Challenge Cup final.
The body was found near Heanor Memorial Park in Derbyshire. Derbyshire Police originally thought the man was 17-year-old Han Lan, but now believe it might be a 21-year-old man named Trung Thanh Hoang. The inquest also heard police think he may not have died at the park but that his body was dropped off there. Police officers are working with Vietnamese authorities to confirm his identity and to find relatives either in the UK or in Vietnam. The inquest at  Derby Coroner's Court heard it was believed the man visited a nightclub in Birmingham on Christmas Eve before returning to an address in Derby after feeling unwell. The cause of death is yet to be established but a toxicology report showed high levels of a number of drugs in his system. Police are still treating his death as suspicious. The inquest was adjourned until the end of March.	The identity of a man found dead in a car park on Christmas Day is still not clear, an inquest into his death has heard.
Isabelle and Stanley Larson from Oxted, Surrey, were burgled in October 2005. The Marine Policing Unit's dive team were working on an unrelated case at Slade Ponds when they recovered the items in a supermarket carrier bag. The Larsons were traced after a public appeal by the police. One of the items found was a watch belonging to Mrs Larson's uncle, that he was given in 1972 in recognition of 40 years' service with the South Eastern Gas Board. Mrs Larson said: "I was amazed when my daughter-in-law said she'd seen a police appeal with pictures of my father's cycling medal and uncle's watch. "I saw the pictures myself and recognised the items straight away - it's wonderful news. "After all this time I had lost hope of ever seeing these items again." PC Steve Morgan, from the Met's dive team, met the couple at their home to return the medal and jewellery. "A decade after these items were stolen it was a privilege to be able to meet the Larsons and give back these items which have such meaning to the family," he said.	A couple who had jewellery stolen more than a decade ago have been reunited with their possessions after they were found at the bottom of a London pond.
A judge said there was a basis for concluding the officers, known as M and Q, may have perverted the course of justice and committed perjury while giving evidence. Pearse Jordan was shot in the back by an RUC officer as he ran from a stolen car he had been driving on the Falls Road in 1982. Judge Horner told Belfast High Court that although he was not duty bound to report the matter, he intended to exercise his discretion. "I do not consider that I am bound to report Officers M and Q to the Director (of prosecutions)," he said. "However, in the present case I intend to exercise my discretion and report Officers M and Q to the Director because I consider that their behaviour sought to conceal the role played by DP2 in the events of November 25, 1992. "This attempted concealment could have seriously impacted on this hearing." The judge rejected an application to lift the anonymity order preventing either officer being named. Mr Jordan, 22, had been driving a stolen car suspected of ferrying IRA munitions when he was shot. He failed to stop when ordered by police and sped away from a patrol car. Earlier this month, Justice Horner delivered findings in what was the third inquest into the highly contentious death. The coroner said he was not convinced either by family claims Mr Jordan was gunned down in cold blood or by police insistence the RUC sergeant acted in self-defence. Testimony from Officers M and Q, who were not directly involved in the shooting, was singled out for specific criticism. The judge concluded that one or both of the officers had edited the original logbook and that they had been untruthful when asked about the identity of the driver of the stolen car. Following the judgment, lawyers for the Jordan family called for M and Q to be investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice and perjury. They also requested both officers be identified. The court was also told the granting of anonymity to officers M and Q was made on the basis of an objectively verified risk to life. The threat to officer M was assessed as moderate, namely that an attack is possible but not likely, but that in the event an appearance at the inquest without anonymity and screening the threat was likely to rise. The threat to officer Q was deemed to be low but could rise to moderate or beyond if identified through court proceedings. The judge said the measure was "necessary and proportionate" given the risk to life. The investigation into Mr Jordan's shooting has been beset by controversy and delay. In 2014, his family were awarded compensation for the lengthy hold-ups in concluding an inquest. An original inquest was adjourned in 1995 after being only part heard. Another probe was held in 2012, but the jury failed to reach consensus on a number of crucial issues - including whether the RUC used reasonable force. Those findings were later quashed after the High Court identified a number of failings in how the probe was run. In his findings, Justice Horner said it was impossible to determine with certainty what happened.	Two police officers who a judge said gave inconsistent and unconvincing evidence to an inquest in to the death of an IRA man are to be reported to prosecutors.
The trees swayed, the rain battered the domed roof of the headquarters building and, given the lecture he'd just delivered to African leaders from their own pulpit, it might well have been the ghosts of dictators past rattling the rafters. He talked about democracy and the "cancer of corruption," but the words which reverberated across the continent were an off-script put-down of leaders who "refuse to step aside when their terms end". The audience cheered, but not surprisingly the assembly's seats weren't filled by the continent's presidents. Instead it was the AU's commission he addressed - its secretariat. That was always the plan according to the White House. Journalists and commentators had been salivating at the prospect of America's first black president meeting Africa's oldest. Robert Mugabe, who's 91, is the AU chairman, and the speech would have rattled the rafters from the inside if the heads of state had been present. "I love my work, but under our constitution I can't run again," President Obama said. "I actually think I'm a pretty good president - I think if I ran again I could win." That's probably not true - given he's only half as popular back in the US as he is in Kenya, the first stop on a trip hailed as a homecoming. "I don't understand why people want to stay so long, especially when they've got a lot of money," he mocked, to the loudest cheer of the day. Third-termism is catching. It's already made a comeback in Burundi, caused a government to collapse in Burkina Faso, and appears on the cards in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of the Congo. And the three elder statesmen of the AU have racked up a hundred years in power between them. Presidents Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea (36), Mugabe of Zimbabwe (35), and Paul Biya of Cameroon (33) are the longest standing of those leaders on the continent who aren't so keen on giving up the trappings of office. "Sometimes you will hear a leader say 'I'm the only person who can keep the nation together'. If that's true that leader has failed to truly build the nation," President Obama said in the last speech of his Africa trip, and arguably his best. He emphasised the defining themes of his visit - the significance of security, particularly the fight against extremism; trade replacing aid; the importance of youth and women, human rights and democracy; and the battle against corruption. They were points you could tick off from every speech from his very first in Kenya, where he opened the Global Entrepreneurship Summit emphasising trade and promising investment. With him on the trip were American businessmen and at least one billionaire. He made sure to visit successful start-up companies, among them one developing a solar lighting system to bring power to the remotest of villages. Power Africa is one of his headline programmes, but has so far failed to achieve much. Big slow-burning fuses in infrastructure, agriculture, trade and young leadership are what he's staking his legacy on. Presidents Clinton and Bush ploughed huge sums into Africa to tackle Aids and malaria - massive health challenges that needed the dollars. China is now the largest single investor in Africa and spares the AU a lecture, but President Obama hopes he can create long-lasting change - providing "not the fish, but the fishing rod" as he put it. His supporters say his African legacy may take time to build, but will bear fruit, and it's obvious he's keen to spend more time on the continent once he's left office. "I'll be honest with you," he told the AU. "I'm looking forward to life after being the president. I won't have this big security detail all the timeâ€¦ and I can visit Africa more often." Coming to Kenya while president was an important part of plotting out that future. He bounded down the stairs from Air Force One in Nairobi, and the video clips of him dancing at the State Dinner showed the passion he has for his "ancestral home". And it was great PR for Kenya. Terror attacks have hit the country's reputation hard and the first ever visit by a sitting American president did a great deal to improve that global image. There was real Obama-mania on the streets of Nairobi, despite the high security and grumbling over road closures. And he didn't pull his punches there either - publicly clashing with President Uhuru Kenyatta over gay rights. President Obama's renewed engagement with Africa began late in his presidency, by gathering the continent's leaders in Washington last year, amid accusations he was playing catch-up with China. America's commitment to resolving the crisis in South Sudan looks unlikely to succeed in the short term as it becomes increasingly complicated and difficult to undo. But it's the long game where President Obama, "Kenya's first American president" as he called himself, will best be judged.	As President Obama finished his speech to the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa last month and stepped off the stage, a tempest whipped up outside.
The inquiry into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust found 20 major failures from 2004 to 2013 at Furness General Hospital. It called the avoidable incidents "serious and shocking". And it criticised the wider NHS for the way it had monitored and regulated events at the hospital. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in the House of Commons that the tragedy was "a second Mid Staffs", albeit on a smaller scale. In an echo of the inquiries in the Stafford Hospital scandal, the independent report said the problems found represented a "simultaneous failure of a great many systems at almost every level, from labour ward to the headquarters of national bodies". Mr Hunt made number of recommendations, saying that the tragedy "must strengthen our resolve to deliver real and lasting culture change so these mistakes are never repeated." He has appointed Dr Mike Durkin, National Director of Patient Safety at NHS England, to draw up new guidelines about reporting serious incidents as well as establish an independent national team that can go on rapid fact finding missions on a "no blames basis" as soon as issues arise. And he's asked Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, Medical Director of NHS England, to review the professional codes of conduct for doctors and nurses to ensure mistakes are reported, not covered up. The investigation - led by Dr Bill Kirkup, a former senior Department of Health official - found: Despite the failures starting in 2004 and continuing throughout the period, including a cluster of five major incidents in 2008, it was only in 2011 that the issues at Furness General came to wider attention. This was after strong criticism from a coroner who looked into the death of newborn Joshua Titcombe. The coroner ruled Joshua had died of natural causes in 2008 but midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection. Around this time, a report came to light that the trust itself had commissioned. It was produced in early 2010 but "suppressed" by the trust. But before that, the trust had failed to act on earlier incidents and even distorted the way information was presented to inquests. Who was failed at Furness? The CQC, regional health authority and ombudsman had not acted properly on what they knew either.  There was knowledge of five major incidents in 2009 as the trust had revealed them as part of its application for foundation trust status, which is reserved for elite trusts. But the regulators did not take the necessary action to fully investigate what had happened, and the trust gained foundation status in September 2010. Dr Kirkup said: "This was a disturbing catalogue of missed opportunities." His inquiry makes 44 recommendations, including: Six midwives are already due before the NMC later this year - and a seventh is being investigated. Meanwhile, a police investigation into the death of Joshua Titcombe is continuing, and the Health and Safety Executive is looking into the case. Pearse Butler, chair of the Morecambe Bay Trust, said: "The trust has made some very serious mistakes. "More than that the same mistakes were repeated. For these reasons, on behalf of the trust, I apologise unreservedly to the families concerned. I am deeply sorry that so many people have suffered." She said the trust would look to learn the lessons of what went wrong. She said there was a new leadership team in place and extra staff had already been taken on. Parent power prompted midwife review James Titcombe's son Joshua was nine days old when he died of sepsis. He was born at Furness General Hospital and was transferred to two other hospitals before dying in Newcastle. "We asked repeatedly if Joshua should have antibiotics and we were told 'No, he didn't [need any]'," said Mr Titcombe. "He was wheezing, and he wasn't feeding properly, and my wife called the emergency bell because he was grunting. "And every time, we were told Joshua was fine and that there was nothing to worry about. At no stage was a doctor ever called." Afterwards Joshua's progress chart went missing, never to re-emerge, and the coroner later said there was a suspicion that it may have been deliberately destroyed. On the report's publication, Mr Titcombe said: "I think I feel deeply sad, angry as well, and vindicated, all at the same time. "For me this report really lays out how preventable Joshua's death was. I really recognise now when we talk about missed opportunities in this report, that for me means not having a six-year-old."	A "lethal mix" of failures at a Cumbrian hospital led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother, an investigation has ruled.
It bought the Grade II listed building for £225,000 in the summer. The Guildhall had been facing uncertainty after the Ministry of Justice announced it was one of 10 law courts to close in Wales. The council said it was still investigating how to make best use of the venue. Carmarthenshire council's deputy leader and executive board member for resources, David Jenkins said one of the main reasons for buying it was to "ensure a secure future." He said it was a "focal point" not just for Carmarthen, but for the whole county. "It has a tremendous history. Murderers have been tried and condemned to death here." They include Ronnie Harries, who was one of the last men to be hanged in Wales. He was sentenced to death in 1953 after murdering his relatives Phoebe and John Harries at their home in Llangynin, Carmarthenshire. The Guildhall was also the setting for Gwynfor Evans' landmark victory as first Plaid Cymru MP in 1966. Mr Jenkins admitted when the Ministry of Justice announced the building was to be sold, they were hoping "to pick it up for a £1," but ended up paying the district valuer's price tag. The council is now speaking to potential partners, including Carmarthen Town Council and Dyfed-Powys Police, about the building's future. "We've got ideas of bringing some of our own services in here," said Cllr Jenkins. "It'll also be good as a museum. We could bring people inside just to see how beautiful it is. "The intention is to make the building self sufficient."	Carmarthen's Guildhall has a "self sufficient" future say council leaders, as the county takes ownership of the historic building.
Two men from Douglas and a 32-year-old man from Liverpool were held in connection with the discovery, which followed a raid at a property in Douglas on Thursday. They are suspected of being involved in the "importation and onward supply" of the Class B drug. The men were remanded in custody and are due to appear in court later. Det Sgt Paul Holland said: "Seizing this amount of cannabis prior to the TT race period puts a significant dent in the availability of obtaining the drug during a busy time."	Cannabis with a street value of £25,000 has been seized and three people arrested on the Isle of Man.
The 23-year-old joined QPR from Swindon in May but he has only made three appearances for the Championship club. Mark Cooper's League One side have been hit by several injuries this season. "An injury has meant he's subsequently struggled for game time," said QPR's director of football Les Ferdinand. "He's only away for a month. He's still got a massive future at QPR." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Swindon Town have re-signed midfielder Ben Gladwin on a 28-day emergency loan deal from Queens Park Rangers.
Party officials opted not to automatically reselect Mohammad Asghar, prompting an open contest. On Thursday night it was announced Mr Asghar had topped the poll. A second AM forced to follow the same procedure, William Graham, finished outside the top  four - meaning he is effectively de-selected. Second on the list will be Laura Anne Jones, previously an AM between 2003-07. In a statement, Mr Graham said: "Whilst I am personally disappointed that I will not be part of an expanding Welsh Conservative team after the elections in May, I remain as invested as any of my colleagues in the goal of bringing an end to this tired Labour government." The Conservatives currently hold two of the available four seats in South Wales East. The 60 AMs include 20 elected via regional lists, aimed to give a fairer reflection of support for each party.	A Conservative AM forced to face a ballot of party members has come top of the South Wales East regional list for the 2016 assembly election.
Comedian Jeremy Hardy, himself banned, suggested Labour was "rigging the election" to stop Jeremy Corbyn. Andy Burnham's campaign claimed there could be "several thousand Tory infiltrators" planning to vote. Mr Corbyn, Mr Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall are all standing. Polls suggest Mr Corbyn is the frontrunner. New regulations allow members of the public to sign up to vote as a "registered supporter" for Â£3. But some have been told their vote will be discounted amid concerns non-Labour supports had registered to take part. "The Labour Party might be trying to invite a legal challenge so that they can say 'let's just scrap the election'," Mr Hardy said. "They are so desperate that I wouldn't be surprised." Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay also accused the party of misusing canvass returns - collected at election time to gauge the level of support for candidates - to find people who have previously voted for other parties. He said the exclusion process had been "arbitrary" and "unfair". "The Labour party has got to stop today doing this," he added. But a Labour spokesman said the party was confident "the processes of verification and handling applications are compliant with the Data Protection Act." He added: "All applications to join the Labour Party as a member, affiliate or supporter are verified and those who are identified by our verification team as being candidates, members or supporters of another political party will be denied a vote." Mr Burnham's campaign, meanwhile, said they had concerns about "potential Tory infiltration on a large scale." Michael Dugher, who is chairing his campaign, wrote to Labour's general secretary calling for a "urgent meeting" of candidate teams to discuss the issue. He claimed "a Conservative MP, Conservative media commentators, and Conservative councillors all having been rejected". He added: "This suggests the 121,000 registered supporters could include several thousand Tory infiltrators, as well as supporters of other parties seeking to have a vote in the election." Also on Friday, Mr Corbyn has said he will formally apologise on behalf of the Labour Party for taking the country to war with Iraq if elected leader. Mr Corbyn told the Guardian the party would "never again flout the United Nations and international law".	Labour says it has "a robust system" to stop "malicious applications" after claims individuals who have registered to vote in the leadership race are being unfairly banned from taking part.
The early work, carried out on mice and pigs, reveals the protein-infused patch encourages the growth of healthy cells and leads to less scarring. Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: "Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. "The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage." Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work "could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction". But she cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans.	A prototype patch could help the repair the damage caused by a heart attack, scientists say.
Among those detained is his brother-in-law and one of the two pilots who flew Guzman to his home state. Mexico's attorney general said a member of Guzman's legal team, described as the mastermind, was also arrested. Guzman, head of the Sinaloa cartel, escaped from a high-security prison through a specially dug tunnel. Attorney General Arely Gomez told reporters on Wednesday that the suspected mastermind of the escape had repeatedly entered Altiplano prison to visit Guzman and update him on the operation's progress. She also said Guzman's brother-in-law had supervised the construction of the mile-long escape tunnel and organised transport. "Today we are able to affirm that the group responsible for planning, organising and carrying out the escape from outside the prison has been broken up,"  Ms Gomez said, without naming the suspects. The development comes days after officials revealed the drugs lord had suffered face and leg injuries when he narrowly evaded a police operation to recapture him in north-west Mexico earlier this month. Ms Gomez confirmed on Wednesday that after his escape, Guzman travelled by land to the city of Queretaro, from where he caught a small plane to his home state of Sinaloa. His escape was an embarrassment for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who Guzman taunted on Twitter after the event. Several prison officials have already been arrested under suspicion of giving inside help to Guzman, who fled through a tunnel that ran 1.5km from under a shower in his cell to outside the prison. Guzman was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and spent nearly a decade in another maximum-security Mexican jail before escaping, reportedly in a laundry basket. He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014 after a series of high-profile arrests of associates and covert surveillance by the US authorities.	Mexico officials say they have arrested six key people who allegedly helped fugitive drug cartel leader Joaquin Guzman escape from jail in July.
She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet. It had been her decision to call the election, and her leadership of the campaign that faltered and in what was described as the most human performance they had seen for quite some time, Theresa May said sorry, time and again. "We saw the human being, not the Maybot"; "it was the first time in seven weeks she didn't say strong and stable"; more poignantly for the Tories MPs who commiserated with each other, "if she'd campaigned like that, we'd have won". They were cheered, relieved perhaps, that she had, tonight, managed to pull it off, to show regret at the calamity her decision to go to the country had unleashed, relieved too that she rose to this particular occasion that seems likely to settle nerves enough to avoid the possibility of the party plunging into another leadership election and potentially therefore, another general election that they might lose. The sense of immediate danger to her leadership has faded. But while her enemies are not breathing down her neck, they are still in the room. One MP told me she wasn't asked any hard questions but deliberately took the time to take all of them, to show willing, "her strategy has been to take as many questions as exist". It's like that episode of the West Wing where the Presidential Candidate Vinick was in deep trouble, so he took endless questions until the press finally got tired and went home - apologies if the American series isn't your thing, but it's an obsession of rather a lot of Westminster types. While publicly it is tonight the done thing for Tories to be fulsomely on the record praising the prime minister, privately it's hard to find a single MP who believes that she will take the party into the next general election.  PM survives first bout of battle for control It is, however, also very hard to find a single MP who wants to unleash even more potential chaos by triggering an election contest, let alone a general election. But it's the circumstances, rather than newly discovered rapture, for the PM that have saved her. One former cabinet minister told me "having a Tory prime minister is much more important than our own wound licking". Another minister told me in the medium term it is "hard to see how" the PM can stay. Theresa May has survived the first bout of what will be a fight to stay in control. The election has redressed the balance, not just between the two main parties, but also between the Tory leader and her party. And the PM knows it, most tellingly also saying to her MPs tonight, "I'll serve as long as you want me". Hardly a bold statement of a leader who feels they are in charge, but an acknowledgement that others will decide when their time is up.	In the slightly sweaty committee corridor outside the meeting of Tory MPs tonight, MPs were queuing to praise the prime minister.
SABMiller said it had agreed "in principle" a £44-a-share offer, after four previous attempts from AB InBev. AB InBev's brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, while SABMiller produces Peroni and Grolsch. If the deal, worth about £70bn, goes ahead, the newly-created firm will make about 30% of the world's beer. SABMiller has a workforce of close to 70,000 people in more than 80 countries, and global annual sales of more than $26bn. AB InBev has a workforce of 155,000 and global revenues of more than $47bn. What deal means for drinkers Anheuser-Busch InBev - 20.8% SABMiller - 9.7% Heineken - 9.1% Carlsberg - 6.1% China Resources Enterprise - 6% Source: Euromonitor, based on 2014 figures AB InBev had made four previous bid approaches for SABMiller - at £38, £40, £42.15, and £43.50 per share - but they had been rejected by SABMiller, which argued they undervalued the company. In a statement, the boards of the two firms said they had now "reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer". The two companies have not yet formally finalised the terms of an offer, but the latest development means they have extended the City deadline for a firm offer until 28 October. Analysis: Matthew Davies, business reporter, Johannesburg SABMiller's African brands are actually one of the main reasons AB InBev is so thirsty for this merger. Carlos Brito, the chief executive of AB InBev, has said that Africa is a "key piece" of the deal. SABMiller, of course, has its roots in Africa - South African Breweries was founded around the time of gold rush in Johannesburg in the late 19th Century. As it stands, and if this deal goes through, it would mean that the merged entity would control 31% of global beer sales. AB InBev's brands are largely concentrated in the Americas and Europe; SABMIller has about 40 brands in Africa. It was the growth of SABMiller's African brands that really attracted AB InBev. What makes these brands so tasty is the growing African middle class, an army of consumers that all the major brewing companies have been eyeing up in recent years. As African beer drinkers have become more prosperous over the past 20 years, they have moved out of the informal home-brewing market and started to buy branded beer. The latest proposal comes a day before the original deadline, by which AB InBev had to make a formal bid for SABMiller or walk away for six months. The offer represents a premium of about 50% over and above SABMiller's share price in mid-September, before the bid battle started. In morning trade in London, SABMiller's share price rose 9% to £39.48, while shares in AB InBev were 2.85% higher at €101.15 in trading in Brussels.	The world's two biggest beer producers are set to merge after SABMiller accepted an increased takeover offer from rival Anheuser-Busch InBev.
Sale had raced to a 31-9 lead just after half-time at AJ Bell Stadium before Wasps found their groove. Tries from Josh Bassett and Ashley Johnson put them back in touching distance at 31-21 before Sale's Will Addison delivered a vital three points. Kurtley Beale scored Wasps' third try 11 minutes from time and that made for a tense finish but Sale held firm. Wasps had been unbeaten in their past six Premiership matches but looked off the pace from early on. Conversely, Sale showed quickly they wanted to make a statement and did so through rugby league covert Solomona. His move from Castleford Tigers has attracted controversy off-the-field, but on it, his hat-trick took his try tally to seven in his first five matches - a new Premiership record. Another new face, South Africa international Willie Le Roux made his Premiership debut for Wasps and the full-back set up Beale's try after coming off the bench. But as Wasps threatened in the closing stages, Sale replacement scrum-half Peter Stringer gained a vital turnover and marshalled his pack to help run down the clock. Sale remain in 10th place, but open up a 10-point gap above Worcester, who lost to Exeter this weekend. At the other end, Wasps remain top by six points, but missed the chance to go as much as 10 points clear of Saracens and Exeter in joint-second. Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond: "First half was particularly good. It was a training ground move for the first try. "Denny's shown his true class a couple of times and he should have got another one really shouldn't he? "Denny takes his opportunities and makes his opportunities and that is what we knew he'd bring to the party. If he keeps doing that, he'll go a long way. "It's good to get us past the 25-point mark, which I always think you need to stay in league." Wasps director of rugby Dai Young: "I'm sure there will be accusations of complacency, but I don't think that was the case. "It is very hard to argue that we weren't where we should be at mentally. We made uncharacteristic mistakes first half that we haven't done all season. "I thought they were the better team, had more edge to them than we did and I thought they deserved their win. "We haven't lost too many physical battles this season so you have to look at yourself really - they had an edge today that we didn't have." Sale: Haley; Solomona, Addison (capt), Jennings, McGuigan; James, Phillips; Harrison, Webber, Aulika, Evans, Nott, Ioane, Lund, Beaumont. Replacements: Nield, Flynn, Longbottom, T Curry, B Curry, Stringer, MacGinty, Leota.

"I can't read anymore," she told the Hollywood Reporter. "I can't paint like I used to. I try to watch movies, but it's quite difficult. "But these are all of the negatives," she added. "What I can do, I do. And I somehow get by." The actress, 79, has age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The condition, which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK, is the cause of more than half of the registrations for blind and partially sighted people in the country. Dame Judi first revealed her diagnosis in 2012, noting her mother had suffered from the same condition. But even before her eyesight began to decline, the Oscar-winner said she preferred to have scripts read aloud to her, as Steve Coogan did for the Oscar-nominated Philomena. "I suppose it's the child in me," she said. "I think somebody coming around and telling you a story is irresistible." The actress said she had no plans to step away from the stage or the camera, calling retirement "the rudest word in my dictionary". "And 'old' is another one. I don't allow that in my house. And being called 'vintage'. I don't want any of those old words. "I like 'enthusiastic' and I like the word 'cut' because that means you've finished the shot." Dame Judi made her professional acting debut at the Old Vic in 1957 and was an acclaimed stage and TV actress before being cast as M in the rejuvenated James Bond franchise in 1995. Two years later, she appeared as Queen Victoria in the TV drama Mrs Brown, which was picked up by film studio Miramax and became a global box office hit. The film kick-started her Hollywood career, and the relationship with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein brought Dame Judi her only Oscar to date, for an eight-minute cameo as Queen Elizabeth in the 1998 movie Shakespeare in Love. She has since received Academy nominations for roles in Chocolat, Iris, Mrs Henderson Presents, Notes on a Scandal and, this year, for Philomena. She is currently in India filming The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2, but her best-known role continues to be James Bond's boss. But, after playing a pivotal role alongside Daniel Craig in Skyfall in 2012, the actress left the part behind, bequeathing it to Ralph Fiennes. "My role as M is over," she told The Hollywood Reporter, "but having had 17 years I think, probably, I would have been given the sack by MI6 already. So it's someone else's turn." On a lighter note, the star also revealed that she had, on more than one occasion, brought her pet goldfish back to life. "I've given the breath of life to [him] twice," she said. "He's now about 8 inches long - almost a full shark - and yes, twice, I breathed into his mouth. He's now called Lazarus."	Dame Judi Dench says she has no plans to retire from acting, despite failing eyesight which has left her unable to read scripts.
James Chester scored the decisive penalty with Vale's Richard Duffy the only man to miss from the spot. Over 120 minutes, Vale matched Albion, who again left wantaway striker Saido Berahino out of their side. The Baggies' Salomon Rondon missed the best chance of the game - hitting the crossbar from close range.	West Brom reached round three of the League Cup courtesy of a penalty shootout after being held to a goalless draw by League One side Port Vale.
The 38-year-old spinner skippered the side to the Division Two title in 2015. "We've got a very special set of players at the moment and it's a great honour to be able to lead them onto the field," he told the club website. "Promotion last season was just the start of what we can achieve. I look forward to playing my part in our continued development." Batty is currently in his second spell at The Oval, having played for Surrey between 1998 and 2001 before returning to south London ahead of the 2010 campaign. He was appointed captain at the start of this year and took 40 first-class wickets at an average of 28.17 last season as Surrey won promotion to Division One. "Batts is playing an incredibly important part of what we're trying to achieve at Surrey," director of cricket Alec Stewart said. "He has shown real leadership qualities on and off the field and his all-round contribution in the progress we are making should not be underestimated."	Surrey captain Gareth Batty has signed a new contract which will keep him at the club until the end of 2017.
6 March 2017 Last updated at 14:51 GMT The window was smashed before accelerant was poured inside and it was set alight at 03:30 GMT on Sunday at the Park Regis Hotel in Broad Street, Birmingham. Mayweather was appearing in the city, meeting fans as part of a tour. An eyewitness who filmed the damaged vehicle but did not wish to be named said: "He [Mayweather] was actually outside when the van was set on fire, then he ran back in. More on this story and others around Birmingham and the Black Country. "There was panic inside the whole hotel. Nobody was allowed out of the hotel for a couple of hours. They had the whole hotel on lockdown." There is no sound on the video.	A van used by retired world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has been set on fire, police said.
NHS managers have proposed a temporary downgrade of the hospital's maternity and paediatric services to cope with staffing shortages. The board of East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust will make a decision on Friday. One paediatric nurse, who asked not to be named, said staff were devastated for their patients. She said: "It's going to mean that many more children will have to make journeys across to Hastings at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. "They're sick. Their families are vulnerable. And I think it's going to have massive implications for children who are sick and for children who are long-term disabled." The NHS trust said the changes were being brought in for safety reasons because it was unable to recruit suitable specialist doctors which had led to an over-reliance on temporary and agency staff. Several options are being considered, but the trust has said its preferred plan is to have consultant-led obstetric services, neonatal services including the special care baby unit, in-patient paediatric services and emergency gynaecology services at the Conquest Hospital in Hastings. Eastbourne hospital would have a stand-alone midwifery-led maternity unit and enhanced paediatric care. Paediatrician Dr David Scott said: "They [patients] will get a better service if they go to Hastings because they will get staff who will be better trained. "There will be greater consultant availability so they will see more senior better trained staff. It will also allow us to increase the levels of nursing care available on the ward." Liz Walke, from the campaign group Save the DGH, which opposes the changes at Eastbourne, said: "We would like an independent body coming in and looking at the whole organisation to see if they can do something better and actually reorganise the services so that both hospitals keep their core services."	Staff at Eastbourne District General Hospital have met NHS bosses over proposals to downgrade services amid claims that patient care will suffer.
Kazi Islam was said to have used "flattery and threats" in exchanges on social media to try to persuade Harry Thomas to kill two soldiers and buy ingredients for a pipe bomb. Islam, 18, of Newham, east London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of preparing to commit acts of terrorism. He claimed he was conducting research. Islam was convicted by a majority of 10 to two and will be sentenced on 29 May. He was remanded in custody and told by Judge Richard Marks that a custodial sentence was inevitable. The trial was told Islam befriended the then 19-year-old Mr Thomas in October 2013 - five months after Fusilier Rigby was attacked in the street near Woolwich Barracks - after meeting him the previous year on an IT course at college. He had pretended to sympathise with Mr Thomas over a break-up with a girlfriend. But a series of exchanges on BlackBerry Messenger and social media sites were uncovered when police raided the house in east London where Islam lived with his family, jurors were told. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Thomas, who has learning difficulties, described Islam as a "very, very manipulative person" but said he had no intention of carrying out his requests. He said: "He makes out he's this really kind person because that's how he comes across at first but deep inside he's evil." Mr Thomas added: "He's not scared to go to prison, he told me that.  And he says he'll end up in a better place for the crimes he's committed. He said his God will look after him and think he's done a really good thing." Commander Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said: "We continue to appeal to anyone who may have knowledge of people with similar intentions. The earliest we can intervene to prevent terrorism the better. "We also remind the public that there is currently a need to protect vulnerable or impressionable adults or children from this brand of Islamic extremism." Prosecutor Annabel Darlow QC had told the court that Islam had tried to encourage Mr Thomas to kill a soldier by telling him innocent children were being murdered by military forces. Ms Darlow told the jury: "Thomas was a vulnerable, not particularly bright young man who was desperate to impress Islam and to try and forge some sort of friendship with him. "Islam ruthlessly exploited to the utmost Thomas's vulnerability and obvious wish to try and ingratiate himself with Islam." The plot was said to have been unwittingly sabotaged by Mr Thomas, who failed to buy any of the right ingredients for a bomb and revealed what was going on to "a few friends" . Giving evidence, Islam told the jury he had talked to Mr Thomas about getting the ingredients for a bomb as an "experiment" in radicalisation and "would have told him what I was doing" if he had actually gone ahead with the purchases. While the court heard he had also downloaded a document on explosives himself, Islam said his interest in extremism was "purely for research purposes and to understand the political side of my religion".	A teenager has been convicted of grooming a vulnerable young man after being inspired by the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.
However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. "My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog." He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. "There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way," he explained. "We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel." It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. "I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level," he said. "A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. "I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there." Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. "They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones," he said. "It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. "That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. "I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common."

Media playback is not supported on this device Scarlets led by 14 points after a frantic first half with Aaron Shingler, Jonathan Evans and DTH van der Merwe scoring tries. Hadleigh Parkes' score - following a superb break by Rhys Patchell 30 seconds after the break - clinched the bonus point and the game. Blues could add only a diving Blaine Scully try to Tom James' early score. After losing their first three games of the season, Scarlets overtake the Blues - who have lost their last three - to move into sixth place in the Pro12 table. The absence of 13 first-choice players on Wales international duty did little to detract from the atmosphere and excitement, although some of the defending was less than top-class. A noisy Friday night crowd were whipped up by four tries in the opening 23 minutes. And they really found their voice during a series of re-set scrummages lasting more than seven minutes before the interval, which eventually resulted in props Taufa'ao Filise and Wyn Jones being shown yellow cards. Scarlets held out under intense pressure with the home crowd baying in vain for referee Lloyd Linton to award a penalty try. Their sense of injustice was further fuelled when Patchell, playing at the Arms Park for the first time since leaving Blues for Scarlets, broke from his own half to set up Parkes from the restart. Media playback is not supported on this device The meeting of the Shingler brothers was another sub-text for the fixture and took its own farcical twist when Aaron was shown a yellow card after being tackled without the ball by Steven. Blues eventually claimed a try when Scully scored acrobatically, but in spite of dominating possession and benefitting from a lopsided penalty count, they could not close the gap further. Forwards Ryan Elias, Will Boyd and Shingler were outstanding in a dominant Scarlets display at the breakdown, the visitors aided by a misfiring Blues lineout. Cardiff Blues: Matthew Morgan; Blaine Scully, Cory Allen, Rey Lee-Lo, Tom James; Steve Shingler, Tomos Williams; Rhys Gill, Kirby Myhill, Taufa'ao Filise, George Earle, James Down, Macauley Cook, Josh Turnbull (capt), Cam Dolan.

Gordon Thomson, 37, said he splashed two basins of water on Russell Findlay after the incident outside his home. Mr Thomson also told the High Court in Glasgow that one of the accused, William Burns, 56, was at the scene. Mr Burns and Alexander Porter, 48, deny attacking the paper's investigations editor in Glasgow on 23 December 2015. Mr Thomson told the court that he heard a child screaming at about 08:30 and "it was more distressed than playful". He said he looked out of his window and saw his neighbour, Mr Findlay, wrestling with another man on the ground. The witness said: "I initially thought it was a burglary. I ran down the stairs and by the time I arrived there Russell was asking the gentleman certain questions." Mr Thomson told the jury that Mr Findlay was sitting astride the man who was on his back and struggling to get free. He said that lying nearby was a red Royal Mail jacket and delivery bag and a broken set of false teeth. The court has previously heard Mr Findlay say that his attacker claimed to be a postman who needed a signature for a parcel, before splashing a "corrosive liquid" on him. In court, Mr Thomson identified the man on the ground struggling with Mr Findlay as Mr Burns. Mr Thomson said that Mr Findlay told him he was an investigative reporter and someone had sent a hit on him and had thrown a substance in his face. The witness said he asked if there was anything he could do and was told by Mr Findlay to fetch water to try to wash the acid off his face. He added: "His face, the right hand side, was starting to blister and his right eye was starting to close over and was very bloodshot." The neighbour told the court that he splashed two basins of water over Mr Findlay's face before ambulance staff took over. Mr Thomson was asked if he heard the man he identified as Mr Burns say anything about who had sent him, and replied: "As he was being led away I heard the words 'Jamie boy sends his regards' or words to that effect." Under cross-examination Mr Thomson was asked if he heard that or had been told that by Mr Findlay and replied: "It's my recollection that I heard it, but possibly." PC David Ross later told the court that when Mr Burns was searched after being detained he was wearing two pairs of gloves - one black woolly pair and below that a clear pair of vinyl gloves. Eye specialist Dr Katheravelu Ramash also gave evidence. Asked what would have happened if the liquid thrown was sulphuric acid and prompt treatment had not followed, Dr Ramash replied: "He could have lost the eyesight in that eye." Mr Burns and Mr Porter deny assaulting Mr Findlay to the danger of his life by throwing sulphuric acid on his face. They also also deny shooting and attempting to murder Ross Sherlock near St Helen's Primary in Bishopbriggs on 24 September 2015. The trial before Judge Sean Murphy QC continues.	A neighbour who came to the aid of a Scottish Sun journalist after he had acid thrown on him has told a court how his face began to blister afterwards.
Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone. ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. "Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. "Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet." Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. "You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. "I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. "But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January). The funds are there." Match ends, St. Johnstone 3, Inverness CT 0. Second Half ends, St. Johnstone 3, Inverness CT 0. Foul by Liam Craig (St. Johnstone).

Two Diarmuid Murtagh goals helped Connacht lead 2-3 to 0-3 before Aidan Breen replied with an Ulster goal. Damien Comer hit a third Connacht goal as they led 3-6 to 1-10 at half-time before Ulster took control. Despite losing Chrissy McKaigue to a black card, Ulster hit 1-4 without reply, with Charlie Vernon netting. McKaigue was joined in the Ulster squad at Carrick-on-Shannon by his Slaughtneil team-mate Brendan Rogers, despite their upcoming All-Ireland club championship duties. Connacht started strongly with their scorer in chief Murtagh firing their opening goal after 7 minutes and again finding the net two minutes later. Ulster responded well with Fermanagh's Breen finding the net for his provincial for the second time in a week with a 18th-minute goal. Pete McGrath's charges cut the gap to two points twice over the next six minutes, and left the minimum between the sides for the first time, after a Tomas Corrigan score. However, Connacht were causing the Ulster defence problems, with Galway's Comer cutting in for a 28th minute goal, as the hosts led by two at the break. Ulster came fired up on the restart, and despite losing substitute McKaigue to a black card, kept motoring well. Peter Harte and Corrigan added point before Vernon cut through for a goal in a spell which saw Ulster score 1-4 without reply. Connacht could only manage two points from frees in the closing quarter, with Emyln Mulligan and Paul Conroy on target. After the game Ulster captain Eoin Donnelly accepted the cup from GAA President Aogan O Fearghail.	Ulster clinched a 32nd Interprovincial football title as they produced a strong second half to earn a 2-16 to 3-10 comeback win over holders Connacht.

It is one of the key ways they say they are going to pay for their spending promises. Should we believe them? First of all, tax avoidance and evasion are very different things. Tax avoidance is legal and includes things that some people would consider to be normal tax planning. Some parties refer to "aggressive tax avoidance". That is also legal but may involve the use of lawyers and accountants to find ways of avoiding tax that were not intended when tax regulations were introduced. Tax evasion is illegal. It seems odd for political parties to say they are going to clamp down on tax evasion. It is like saying you are going to clamp down on theft and then putting a figure on how much you are going to save by doing so. On the plus side, it is unlikely that voters will say it is the wrong thing to do. The Conservatives say they will save £5bn by clamping down on avoidance and evasion, the Liberal Democrats say £6bn and Labour tops the claims at £7.5bn. Paul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: "All three parties are just making up numbers, quite honestly." "Who knows whether that's feasible? Who knows whether that's the kind of money that's achievable? And frankly we'll never know." And this is the key problem - it is very difficult to predict how much you can save by clamping down on avoidance and evasion, but Revenue & Customs (HMRC) also finds it very difficult to work out how much has been saved in the past. It can tell you some of it. For example, it can tell you how much it has won at tax tribunals when there has been a legal dispute. And it can try to put a figure on the outcome of specific policies, such as the tax cooperation agreement between the UK and Switzerland. The Office for Budget Responsibility initially predicted that policy would raise £5.3bn. But it later had to cut this figure to £1.9bn, which gives an idea of the margin of error in such forecasts. When looking at a particular set of Budget anti-avoidance measures, the OBR concluded some had raised more than expected and some less, so the overall outcome had been pretty much as expected, which confirmed its warning that "avoidance costings are subject to significant uncertainty". Why is it so difficult? Look at Labour's plans to abolish non-dom status, which was the subject of a previous Reality Check. When you change the tax regulations, especially the way you tax the very rich, people tend to change their behaviour. With non-doms, we do not know how much tax they would be paying if they did not enjoy this status. And it would be very difficult in retrospect to work out how much more tax had been raised as a result of its abolition. To Labour's credit, it has not tried to put precise figures on the amount they would raise from the abolition, but it is part of their £7.5bn claim. The Conservatives say they have raised £7bn by clamping down on avoidance, and point to this document to support their claim. So maybe the figures are improving, although the publication is a bit short of detail. On the other hand, this document from HMRC estimates that in 2012-13, £7.2bn was lost to the exchequer by avoidance and evasion. Now, it may have risen considerably since then, but if £7bn has been saved already, it is hard to see where the extra billions are going to come from in the next Parliament. What's the truth behind the politicians' claims on the campaign trail? Our experts investigate the facts, and wider stories, behind the soundbites. Read latest updates or follow us on Twitter @BBCRealityCheck	We've heard a lot in this election campaign about how much parties say they will save by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion.
Alexander Young crashed his Iveco Daily van into Andrew Nisbet's parked car on 25 November 2015. Mr Nisbet, 58, suffered fatal injuries when he was struck by his own vehicle Young pled guilty to a careless driving charge at Livingston Sheriff Court. The collision happened on the B7066 Whitburn Link Road near Polkemmet Country Park. The court was told that Mr Nisbet's car was parked with its hazard warning lights flashing when the accident happened. Young, 62, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, admitted failing to observe Mr Nisbet's car and colliding with it. Police said at the time that the van driver had suffered only minor injuries in the crash. Mr Nisbet, from Sauchie, Alloa, was married with a family. He was described him as "a much loved husband and father" who would be sorely missed.	A van driver who crashed into a stationary car, fatally injuring its driver, has admitted careless driving.
He said pro-devolutionists should be working together to ensure Wales does not lose powers. The former party leader dramatically announced his exit on Friday, prompting anger from some of his colleagues. He has rejected demands for him to stand down and trigger a by-election. Labour has a minority of AMs in the assembly and needs other parties to help govern. Plaid Cymru has not agreed to a formal coalition deal with Labour, but did allow Carwyn Jones to return as first minister following an earlier deadlocked vote over whether Mr Jones or Plaid leader Leanne Wood would take the top job. Lord Elis-Thomas, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said: "It was clear to me that the Plaid group in the National Assembly was not willing to seriously participate in government and to give Wales a stable government, particularly after the decisions taken in Wales and elsewhere about our future relationship with the European Union". "There is a serious constitutional challenge now and we might well lose powers from Wales," he said. "I think all pro-devolutionists should be working together to ensure that doesn't happen." Lord Elis-Thomas was critical of the deadlocked first minister vote, caused when the Tories and UKIP backed Ms Wood for the top job. He said it was done without his knowledge and was "totally inappropriate". Asked if he would support the next Welsh Government budget, which is due to be tabled on Tuesday, he said: "It depends on what's in it." "I have to be satisfied that that budget contains funding for the work I'm doing for them now", he said, pointing to his work on the future of designated natural landscape areas in Wales. Last year Lord Elis-Thomas clashed with his party over remarks he made about its general election campaign. He suggested efforts in the wake of the row to make him refrain from public statements about controversial issues breached his human rights. On Saturday the peer alleged that he had been "forced to attend an unconstitutional party meeting" by the national executive committee "in which they sought to deselect me as a candidate in Dwyfor Meirionnydd after I had been selected properly by the constituency party". "The whole episode was totally disorderly. I said so at the time, they wouldn't listen to me," he said. Lord Elis-Thomas said he had been "forced to agree to not speaking publicly about any matters they regarded as controversial without specific permission of the party chair". "I stuck with that until the last election," he added. "I certainly don't think I had any further obligation to anyone within the party and that I should be able to speak my mind as an assembly member. "It's contrary to democratic principles as well as my human rights to try to stop an AM from speaking out in support of his constituents and in support of his own principles." Former Plaid Cymru president Dafydd Iwan was among party figures who criticised the former presiding officer at the weekend. He said: "I'm saddened by his decision. "But I think Dafydd has never been a good team player and and he's failed to put the cause and his party before his own self-preservation. "I think this is a step too far," he said, adding that there should be a by-election. Plaid AM Bethan Jenkins said: "I am sad and angry at the decision made by Dafydd." The South Wales West AM said: "Does Dafydd want his legacy to be that of letting Plaid voters and our nation down in such a way, after achieving so much as a Plaid MP, presiding officer, and former leader of the party? "This action... has shown that he has let his constituents, the nation, and the party down." Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid AM for Anglesey, told BBC Radio Wales: "If this was happening towards the end of a parliamentary term, it might be different. "But this is within five months of the election in the context where Dafydd Elis-Thomas, a major contributor to Welsh political life over the years, had an opportunity to stand as an independent, which he had every right to do." "And he said, no, I'm loyal to Plaid Cymru, trust me on this one," said Mr ap Iorwerth. "And there's an element of breaking that trust." At least one Plaid Cymru party member, who did not want to be identified, had sympathy with Lord Elis-Thomas. The source said: "I'm not surprised. The group is not run in an inclusive way." The Plaid member added that Lord Elis-Thomas "should have been shown more respect". A Welsh Tory source on Saturday suggested that Plaid Cymru should give up the title of the official opposition now that it has the same number of AMs as the Conservatives in the assembly. The source said: "Its like bald men fighting over a comb. We're not going to fight over the designation - but either the title of official opposition is shared by Plaid or it is dropped." A spokesman for the party added: "The Welsh Conservatives will continue to be the real opposition". As we have seen with Nathan Gill's departure from the UKIP group at the Senedd, it does not take long for internal splits to develop in this assembly term. There are potentially big implications for the assembly. Labour narrowly missed out on an overall majority, and with two floating votes up for grabs in the form of Lord Elis-Thomas and Nathan Gill, Plaid and the Tories may find it more difficult to put the squeeze on Labour. Having said that, Labour has formal mechanisms in place with Plaid to discuss the budget, Brexit, legislation and the constitution, so there's likely to be a willingness to make that work. Read Nick's blog. Carmarthen-born Lord Elis-Thomas began his political career in Westminster, serving as a member of parliament for Meirionydd between 1974 and 1983 and for Meirionydd Nant Conwy between 1983 and 1992. In 1992, he was made a life peer. Lord Elis-Thomas was elected to the newly established National Assembly for Wales in 1999, representing the Meirionnydd Nant Conwy constituency until it was abolished in 2007. He has served as the AM for the constituency of Dwyfor Meirionnydd since that year's election. The peer served as presiding officer from the start of the institution until 2011. As the assembly's figurehead he clashed with Leanne Wood, who is now party leader, in 2004. Lord Elis-Thomas ordered her to leave the Senedd chamber on the grounds of 'discourtesy' when she refused to withdraw her reference to the Queen as 'Mrs Windsor'. He had made a bid to become party leader in 2012 but lost to Ms Wood, and since then Lord Elis-Thomas has repeatedly fallen out with the party leadership. That year Plaid Cymru withdrew the whip from Lord Elis-Thomas after he failed to attend a vote of no confidence in then health secretary Lesley Griffiths. In March 2014 he was fired as transport spokesperson and chairman of the assembly's environment committee following his criticism of the leader's attack on UKIP at the party's spring conference. The former assembly presiding officer said it was "facile" of Ms Wood to say a vote for UKIP is a vote against Wales. In 2015 the AM criticised the party's general election campaign, leading to him to face disciplinary action. He won the support of local party members at that time, but clashed again with the party when he backed Labour's north Wales police and crime commissioner candidate earlier this year.	Lord Elis-Thomas left Plaid Cymru to sit as an independent AM because the party was not "serious" about taking part in the Labour-led Welsh Government, he has said.
The Coniston workings are sited in the south west of the Lake District National Park, below Coniston Old Man and Penny Rigg Mill. Lake District Park adviser, Eleanor Kingston, said volunteers were needed to help with conservation and archaeological survey work. It would give people the chance to "connect with their heritage" she said. Copper was mined at the scheduled monument until the 1950s. Over the next two years more than 150 repairs will be made and work carried out to stabilise structures. Chalcopyrite, a copper iron sulphide often known as Fool's Gold, was used for 16th century weapons, coins and the hulls of ships. German workers were brought to Coniston by Queen Elizabeth I to extract it. At its peak in the 19th century the mine employed 600 people.	A £450,000 Heritage Lottery grant has helped secure the future of a 400-year-old copper mine in Cumbria.
Organisers said this year's festival would celebrate and champion Ms Suu Kyi's cause and world vision. Ms Suu Kyi said it was wonderful to know there was so much support for the effort to bring democracy to Burma. Events include a discussion with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange called Article 19, which will look at Freedom of Information and the right to know. 'Use your liberty' Ms Suu Kyi will not be attending the event, but in a statement she said: "It is especially pleasing for me to see, albeit remotely, Brighton Festival taking shape this year, and to think that so many people will come together in May to celebrate great art and experience the inner peace it brings. "It is wonderful too to know that there is such support for the effort to bring democracy and freedom to Burma, for which the Burmese people have been diligently working for so long." She urged people involved in the festival to "continue to use your liberty to promote ours" - a plea which arts organisers said had been taken to the heart of the event. The Burmese military authorities released the Nobel Peace Prize winner from house arrest on 13 November last year. She had been detained for 15 of the previous 21 years. Thousands of people gathered outside the home of 65-year-old Ms Suu Kyi to greet her and hear her speak. Since her release, she has called for a peaceful revolution in Burma and said she hoped for a non-violent end to military rule. Her brother-in-law Adrian Phillips said: "Aung San Suu Kyi has often said how important music and the arts have been to her throughout her life. "Brighton Festival is a wonderful opportunity to bring her struggle to a wider public, at a time when it is so important for the world to keep remembering what remains to be done in Burma." Festival chief executive Andrew Comben said he hoped the programme reflected some of Ms Suu Kyi's extraordinary spirit. He said an incredible collection of artists had come together to celebrate an iconic woman who inspired so many. The Asian Dub Foundation will open this year's festival with a live performance inspired by the struggle in Burma. One performance, called The New World Order, is offering the audience a "visceral experience of imprisonment" and will take people on a journey through Victorian police cells. And Beethoven's opera, Fidelio, chosen for "startlingly contemporary" themes of wrongful incarceration, abuse of power and personal sacrifice, will be performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and Brighton Festival Chorus. The full festival programme is due to be launched later this month.	Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been named as the guest director of the 2011 Brighton Festival.
The distinct language and genetic make-up of the Basque people in northern Spain and southern France has puzzled anthropologists for decades. One theory proposed that they were an unmixed pocket of indigenous hunters. Now, a study in PNAS journal suggests they descend from early farmers who mixed with local hunters before becoming isolated for millennia. The Basques have unique customs and a language - Euskera - that is unrelated to any other spoken in Europe, or indeed the world. Nestled in a mountainous corner of Atlantic Europe, they also show distinct genetic patterns to their neighbours in France and Spain. It seemed logical that they were representatives of an older layer of population settlement, but just how far back their roots went has been a topic of debate. Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University in Sweden analysed the genomes of eight Stone Age human skeletons from El PortalÃ³n in Atapuerca, northern Spain. These individuals lived between 3,500 and 5,500 years ago, after the transition to farming in southwest Europe. The results show that these early Iberian farmers are the closest ancestors to present-day Basques. Comparisons with other ancient European farmers show that agriculture was brought to Iberia by the same migrant groups that introduced it to central and northern Europe. These pioneers expanded from a homeland in the Near East, sweeping across Europe about 7,000 years ago to usher in the period known as the Neolithic. Once the farmers settled down, they mixed with local hunter-gatherers - the descendants of people who lived in Europe during the last Ice Age. Indeed, the El PortalÃ³n individuals had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than pioneer farmers from Germany, Hungary and Spain who lived several thousand years earlier. The new study also goes some way to explaining some of the differences between the Basques and their neighbours in France and Spain. After the initial farmer-hunter mixture was set, the ancestors of the Basques became isolated from surrounding groups - perhaps due to a combination of geography and culture. "It's hard to speculate, but we've been working with Basque historians and it's clear from the historical record that this area was very difficult to conquer," Prof Jakobsson told BBC News. This means the Basque area was largely unaffected by subsequent migrations that shaped genetic patterns elsewhere in Europe. One of these movements occurred in the Bronze Age, when pastoralists from the Steppe - on the eastern periphery of the continent - travelled west en masse. This migration probably spread Indo-European languages across Europe, affecting the central and northern parts of the continent to a greater extent than the south. While the genomes of French and Spanish individuals showed evidence of this eastern genetic input, those of Basques did not. Another migration served to further differentiate Basques from their Spanish neighbours. In AD 711, a Muslim army crossed from North Africa into Iberia, beginning an occupation that lasted more than 700 years. Again, while a small amount of North African and Sub-Saharan ancestry can be detected in the Spanish, it is largely absent from the Basques. Previous studies have shown that people native to the Italian island of Sardinia are most genetically similar to the pioneer farmers of central Europe. The Sardinians also became isolated after the agricultural transition, but they lack the additional hunter-gatherer ancestry that characterises the Basques. Paradoxically, while archaeology shows that Europe's earliest farmers hailed from the Near East, populations living in that region today do not particularly resemble them genetically. This is because genetic patterns in Turkey and the Middle East were re-shaped by migrations from surrounding areas after the Early Neolithic. The proportion of hunter-gatherer ancestry varies across Europe, peaking at about 30% in Estonians and Lithuanians, but no "pure" indigenous Europeans remain. They appear to have been assimilated by the Neolithic migrants, who probably had greater numbers.	DNA from ancient remains seems to have solved the puzzle of one of Europe's most enigmatic people: the Basques.
Miss Beckford, who came to the UK from Jamaica aged 17, was also a prominent race equality campaigner. Marvin Rees said he was "very sad" to hear the news and hers was "a life very well lived". The former midwife, who was the first black recipient of an MBE in the South West, died at a care home in Bristol earlier this week. She helped set up the St Pauls Carnival in 1967, was appointed the first Race Relations Officer in Bristol and also worked alongside the bus boycott campaigner Paul Stephenson, to improve racial equality in the city. Councillor Asher Craig announced Miss Beckford's death and told Bristol24/7: "She was a beautiful woman and had a heart of gold. "She was extremely stylish and was an amazing networker who had all the skills and expertise of a socialite, which she capitalised on in her role as the entertainments officer on the board of St Paul's Carnival. "The legacy of Carmen Beckford's contribution towards helping to create a more equal and integrated city must never be forgotten and I will ensure that it lives on." Miss Beckford is one of "seven saints of St Pauls" who will be commemorated in giant murals, due to be painted by artist Michele Curtis this summer. The portraits of prominent black Bristolians will be painted on houses or prominent buildings along the route of the St Pauls carnival procession.	The mayor of Bristol has led tributes to Carmen Beckford, the founder of St Pauls Carnival, who has died aged 87.
Adventures in the Anthropocene is her record of the people and places she encountered on a huge global tour. The book details how humans are altering the planet, but it also tells the stories of how we are learning to limit and cope with that change. The Royal Society Winton Prize is worth Â£25,000 to the winner. "Anthropocene" is the word used by many scientists to describe the epoch of humanity's profound influence on the Earth. There are arguments over when our activities started to distort natural processes, but there is no doubting the effects today. Pollution, species loss, over-exploitation of water and mineral resources, and of course climate change. The list goes on. This is "the age we made". Gaia knew all the data from her job as a science reporter, but she wanted to see the impacts first-hand. So, she put on hold the nine-to-five existence and bought a one-way ticket to Kathmandu, to start a personal odyssey and directly sample some of the global upheaval. She expected to be gone no more than six months, but two-and-a-half years later, she and her backpack were still travelling and still talking to people about their experiences. Adventures in the Anthropocene is not simply a book of doom and gloom. It has many inspiring characters. These are the individuals with bottom-up approaches to meeting the particular challenges they are facing - like the man making his own glaciers in the Indian Himalayas to store water for his neighbours, or the Belize man who has built an island habitat out of rubbish that he's collected from the sea. "I really wanted it to be an optimistic book, because I'm an optimist; because we are incredible, we are ingenious, we are this resourceful species," she told me. "So, yes, although we've put ourselves in this position, and are reaching all sorts of crises in various different ways in terms of food, water, energy, etc - we're also very capable of turning things around. "I met incredible people all around the world who are already doing things for themselves. "They're not waiting for someone in Berkeley, or Yale, or Oxford to come up with amazing solutions (although perhaps that's where the solutions will come from); they're also coming from the people who are living in conflict with our massive changes. We need to learn from them." You can listen to Gaia talk about her book in the audio interview at the top of the page. And still available to hear online is The Age We Made series of radio programmes that Gaia presented for the BBC World Service. The four episodes (1, 2, 3, and 4) can also be downloaded as podcasts.

Four buzzard nests and one goshawk nest were found abandoned in Moy Forest at Tomatin late last month. The adult birds have disappeared and police said some of the sites appeared to have been deliberately disturbed by illegal activity. Moy Forest is managed by Forestry Enterprise Scotland and the nests were being monitored by its staff. Insp Mike Middlehurst, a wildlife crime officer at Police Scotland, said: "Raptor persecution is an ongoing issue for the Highlands and we need the public to come forward and work with us to try and eradicate this blight on the Highlands. "Police Scotland with partners in the Highland Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime has worked to increase public confidence in reporting wildlife offences which has resulted in increased reporting. "In this case a partner agency has a clearly documented history of birds being at this location." He added: "I appeal to the public to come forward with information which may assist us in detection of wildlife crime which either relates to this incident or any other." Giles Brockman, environment manager for Forest Enterprise Scotland, said: "I am really disappointed to see this case of deliberate persecution on the National Forest Estate. "Forest Enterprise Scotland will work closely with partners to stop this unacceptable practice."	Police are investigating the disturbance of bird of prey nests in a forest south of Inverness.
The Norwegian,  who also won the sixth stage of the race in Lisieux, proved the strongest of a breakaway group of 14 riders over the stage's final climb. Frenchman Thomas Voeckler ended an eighth day in yellow, but conceded 27 seconds to his main rivals. Australian Cadel Evans is his nearest challenger - one minute 18 seconds behind with four stages to go. Manx sprinter Mark Cavendish put in another solid shift, picking up a point at the intermediate checkpoint and retaining his green jersey. Team Sky's strong showing in the absence of team leader Bradley Wiggins, who suffered a broken collarbone on stage seven, has also made it a successful Tour for the only British team in the race. Rigoberto Uran and Geraint Thomas have both held the jersey for the race's best young rider, while Boasson Hagen is emerging as a consistent threat at the end of each stage. The 24-year-old played his part in a 14-strong breakaway that established an advantage of more than seven minutes over the peloton as they climbed the category-two Col de Montgenevre. Irishman Nicolas Roche attempted in vain to lead a group of three across the gap as the field climbed over the border and up to the Italian resort of Sestriere. But, with any gains immediately at risk on a subsequent 48km descent, the general classification contenders were content to save their aggression for Pramartino - the stage's final ascent. After breaking free at the head of the field, Spaniard Ruben Perez Moreno reached Sestriere with a clear lead and raced solo downhill in a bold attempt to win from the front. With 20km to go, the lone leader's lead of over a minute was still intact but he was absorbed back into the chasing pack as they climbed for the final time. French champion Sylvain Chavanel initially took on the pace but he could not shake Boasson Hagen who powered away before nervelessly navigating the winding downhill roads to Pinerolo for his victory. "If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with Contador, Evans and the Schlecks Back in the field, Alberto Contador tested Andy Schleck and Voeckler with a burst of acceleration. But the descent proved more profitable for the Spaniard as Voeckler lost crucial time running wide on the corner as he struggled to keep with the downhill pace. Contador, a three-time winner, and his compatriot Samuel Sanchez looked as if they may make inroads into the rest of their rivals as they pressed in the final kilometres. But Andy Schleck, who had looked nervous in wet weather on the way down to La Rochette on Tuesday, brother Frank and Evans stuck doggedly to their tail to record the same time. Contador confirmed that, after getting caught up in a pile-up on the first stage and suffering a knee injury earlier in the race, he had to take some risks in a bid to win a fourth Tour de France. "It was a very dangerous descent," he said. "I was off the front, I saw I could attack and the important thing is to pull back time every day." And Voeckler revealed that Contador's approach was at least a partial success, convincing him to ride unnecessarily aggressively in the closing stages. "It's a pity, because I saw that Contador, Evans and the Schlecks finished together," reflected Voeckler. "If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with them."

Notts will drop into Division Two next season after losing their penultimate fixture to leaders Middlesex. Newell, who will hand first-team duties to ex-England coach Peter Moores, told BBC Radio Nottingham relegation in cricket is "about the shame". "It's about the embarrassment of getting relegated," Newell added. "Financially it is not like losing your place in the Premier League in football. Financially it doesn't make a huge difference; it makes a difference to the supporters. "It is more about the impact it has on the ego of the players and the impact on the supporters who are used to seeing Division One cricket. "We are proud club; we have been in Division One for a long time and it's ten years since I stood here and had to explain away a relegation." Notts have only won once in the Championship this season and now return to Division Two for the first time in nine years.	Nottinghamshire's relegation from the County Championship's top flight is "embarrassing", according to director of cricket Mick Newell.
The council's cabinet had recommended changing Brecon High School to an English-medium school from 1 September. But 32 members of full council opposed the plans, with eight in favour. The vote was taken as an indication of the full council's views but it was not a final decision. That rests with the cabinet which meets on 14 March. A council report said low pupil numbers and the "need to ensure robust linguistic progression and appropriate curriculum choice for Welsh-medium pupils" were the reasons for the recommendation. The council plans to centralise Welsh-medium education for mid and south Powys in Builth Wells High School, which is a 40 mile round trip. A consultation has been carried out on the plans, with staff, parents and pupils raising a number of concerns. Among them were pupils missing out on extra-curricular activities, such as after school clubs and music lessons, due to having to travel to Builth Wells for Welsh-medium education.	A majority of councillors voted in favour of retaining a Welsh-medium stream at a Powys school on Tuesday.
Coronation Street, which celebrates 50 years on the screen in December, picked up a special honorary award. Doctor Who won best family drama prize - with actress Karen Gillan, who made her debut this year as assistant Amy Pond, on hand to accept the award. The awards were hosted by Alexander Armstrong at London's Dorchester Hotel. The BBC 1980s cop drama Ashes To Ashes was named best drama while best new drama went to hit US musical comedy Glee. Philip Glenister, who played DCI Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes, admitted that the show had ended at the right time. "All good things come to an end. I think that was enough, the danger is you start repeating yourself. There's only so much you can have him talking, shouting and nicking people," he said. ITV1 show Emmerdale took the titles for best soap actor, Danny Miller, who plays mechanic Aaron Livesy, and best soap newcomer Adam Thomas who plays Adam Barton. It also collected the prize for best soap storyline over Aaron Livesy's sexual confusion. Coronation Street stars on the red carpet were both nervous and excited about the prospect of a "live" episode to mark the soap's 50th anniversary. William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, said: "We'll get through. We're used to working in short spurts, so to do an hour live is frightening." Earlier this year it was revealed that key characters will be killed off in a tram crash which occurs in Weatherfield in December. Anthony Cotton, who plays Sean Tulley, said: "We don't know who's going to be on the receiving end of any of the disasters. I'm hoping it might be back like the days when we didn't know who shot JR." EastEnders took the top soap prize in a year that saw its first live episode. Lacey Turner won best soap actress for her portrayal of teen mother Stacey Branning. Later this week the show sees a blaze at the Queen Vic and the departure of landlady Peggy Mitchell, played by Barbara Windsor. Scott Maslen, who plays Jack Branning, said Windsor leaving was a "massive loss" to the programme. "Barbara is very small, but a massive personality and she's going to be sorely missed," he said. Britain's Got Talent triumphed over Dancing On Ice, Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor to land the best TV talent show prize. Assault course show Total Wipeout was named best gameshow. James Corden and Ruth Jones's BBC series Gavin and Stacey was named best comedy. Denise Welch was named best actress for Waterloo Road while Jack O'Connell from Skins was best actor. Winners in full:	Emmerdale has won three prizes at the TV Choice Awards, with EastEnders taking the prize of best soap - in its 25th anniversary year.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old London 2012 gold medallist recorded 8.18m in his final jump to win ahead of Uruguay's Emiliano Lasa (7.96m). Holly Bradshaw set a new British women's pole vault record of 4.80m. There was a minute's silence before the event for the victims of Monday's attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and another 116 were injured by a suicide bomber as the crowd left a performance by US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The Great City Games, which is staged in the city centre, was given the go-ahead by council and police on Tuesday. The Great Manchester Run will also go ahead this Sunday and will be covered on BBC One from 12:30-14:30 BST. Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. "It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us," said Rutherford afterwards. "It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. "Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to. I love it for the football and I love it for all you guys getting behind us in sport. "It truly is a special place." Media playback is not supported on this device It was a superb evening for Bradshaw, who beat her own personal best before going on to surpass her own British record in the pole vault. Starting at 4.50m, the 25-year-old from Preston cleared at the third attempt to ensure victory over her rivals, with fellow Britons Rachel Gibbons and Sally Peake and Belgium's Chloe Henry all failing to go higher than 4m. She then went on to surpass the mark of 4.71m she set in 2012 before also clearing 4.80m at the first attempt. "It was a bit nerve-wracking at the start," Bradshaw, who was sixth at London 2012 and fifth four years later in Rio, told BBC Sport. "But there were great conditions. Once I got in the zone, to jump 4.72 and then 4.80 I am really chuffed. "Training has been going great. I am in the best shape I have ever been in. I just need to stay healthy, keep sharp and build momentum going into the majors." Media playback is not supported on this device Jonnie Peacock eased to victory in the T44 men's 100m in 10.92 seconds, accelerating to pull well ahead of his three challengers. South Africa's Arnu Fourie was second (11.25secs), with Michail Seitis third (11.39) and Italy's Emanuele di Marino fourth (12.18). "We had a massive shift on technical aspects last year and had just six months to get them right before the Olympics but we improved a lot," Peacock told BBC Sport. "I still have a lot to improve. My first five metres today were terrible." Sophie Kamlish made it a British double in the event with victory in the T44 women's 100m, beating Dutch three-time Paralympic gold medallist Marlou van Rhijn by 0.02secs in a time of 13.24. On the specially laid track on Deansgate, Asha Philip pipped Australian Sally Pearson to the win the women's 100m in a time of 11.48secs. Pearson made up for that disappointment by winning the final race of the evening - the 100m hurdles - in 12.81secs. Another Briton, James Dasaolu, clocked 10.25 to take the men's 100m after 41-year-old Kim Collins, who claimed gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, pulled up with cramp. American Johnny Dutch, who was coaxed out of retirement last year, impressed in the men's 200m hurdles with a time of 22.48secs, comfortably beating a British trio led by Sebastian Rodger (22.89). There was a surprise result in the men's 150m as Greece's Lykourgos-Stefanos Tsakonas claimed a personal best of 15.04secs to see off the challenge of Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who also ran a PB of 15.22. Fellow Briton Richard Kilty was third in 15.43.	Britain's Greg Rutherford claimed a resounding long-jump victory at the Great City Games in front of a big crowd in Manchester's Albert Square.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson endorsed her party's UK manifesto. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were "talking up" the SNP's prospects. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld. Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances. She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax. Ms Davidson added: "We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives. "The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years." However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were "putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price". He added: "The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon. "I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further. "And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland." What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election? Policy guide: Where the parties stand Ms Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning. She said: "People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots. "And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see." The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in. In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum. In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits. Mr Murphy said: "The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a £7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it. "Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity. "Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need." Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives. Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: "Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment." Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP. Polling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons.	General election campaigning is continuing during a week which is being dominated by manifesto launches.
The competition kicked off on Friday evening as Ayr United beat neighbours Kilmarnock 1-0 in Group E. And the cup gets into full swing on Saturday, with 15 more games. Well have lost to two English National League sides in pre-season, while Hibs' games included a draw with Sunderland. Lennon's side beat Dunfermline Athletic and Berwick Rangers in pre-season and will host Montrose in the Group D match. "I was never a lover of pre-season when I played and as a manager I never paid to much attention to the results either," lennon told HibsTV. "It was all about getting the players fit, but I've been pleased so far. The players have done very well. "We know what is ahead of us and we know what's at stake in the Betfred Cup. We want to go as far in the competition as we can, if not win it." Nigeria defender Efe Ambrose will not feature against the Gable Endies after arriving back at training two days late with the Edinburgh club. The 28-year-old, who was signed from Celtic this summer, said his delay was  because of a personal matter. Lennon said this has now been resolved. It is the second year of the new League Cup group-stage format, with Premiership rivals Ross County hosting League One's Alloa Athletic in Saturday's other Group D game. Motherwell are the top seeds in Group F, but the squad that is being reshaped by Robinson [nine players have arrived with 16 exiting] have suffered defeats by Gateshead and Barrow. "The cup competition comes really, really early," the Well manager said before their trip to face League One side Queen's Park. "I would rather have people 100% ready, but everybody's in the same boat. "We will get better, especially our understanding. We brought in nine players and potentially one or two more. "I think we need a bit of an injection of pace in the top end of the pitch, but we probably have to move people on first." One player Robinson has no intention of losing is Louis Moult, and the manager insisted the striker is ready to give 100% despite a rejected bid from Aberdeen. Group H top seeds Partick Thistle face a tricky opener at home to Livingston, who won promotion to the Championship. Thistle midfielder Stuart Bannigan is close to a return after 15 months on the sidelines through injury, but the 24-year-old is unlikely to feature as manager Alan Archibald is wary of rushing his recovery. Archibald is already without right-back Mustapha Dumbuya, who is facing a couple of months on the sidelines after having surgery on an injury. Fellow defender Niall Keown is also doubt after picking up a knock before leaving Reading. Archibald has therefore been forced back into the transfer market to find a new right-back as well as a new striker after Ade Azeez departed for Cambridge United. With Aberdeen, holders Celtic, Rangers and St Johnstone not featuring until the next round because they were in European competition, Hamilton Academical are the other top-flight side in action on Saturday. They made their first signing of the close season on Friday, with French central defender Xavier Tomas joining for an undisclosed fee from Swiss club Lausanne-Sport. However, the 31-year-old will not feature away to Lowland League champions East Kilbride as he requires international clearance. Group A Falkirk v Stirling Albion Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Brechin City Group B Dunfermline Athletic v Elgin City Peterhead v East Fife Group C Cowdenbeath v Buckie Thistle Dundee United v Raith Rovers Group D Hibernian v Montrose Ross County v Alloa Athletic Group E Clyde v Annan Athletic Group F Berwick Rangers v Greenock Morton Queen's Park v Motherwell Group G East Kilbride v Hamilton Academical Stenhousemuir v Queen of the South Group H Livingston v Partick Thistle Stranraer v St Mirren	Hibernian's Neil Lennon hopes pre-season results are a prelude to Scottish League Cup success while Motherwell's Stephen Robinson will look to improve on results over the summer.
The so-called Christmas Blitz on the evening of 22 December reduced shops and buildings in St Ann's Square to ruins. The area around Deansgate near the cathedral was badly damaged, with a large bomb crater marking the road. War Office photographer William Lockeyear took a series of images as buildings burned and masonry came tumbling down. The sky glowed orange as huge clouds of smoke billowed and thickened the air with dust. The pungent whiff of burning wood and the smell of powdered brick and plaster lingered. Two waves of bombs pounded the city from 20:00 GMT on 22 December, only ending at 06:00 the next day. Among the buildings hit in the heart of the city were Manchester's Free Trade Hall, the Royal Exchange, Smithfield Market, Cheethams Hospital, the Gaiety Theatre and St Ann's Church. In total, 684 people died and a further 2,300 were wounded with districts to the north and east of the city badly affected, notably Cheetham Hill and Strangeways. At least 8,000 homes were made uninhabitable. During the war as a whole, 1,400 civilians died in Manchester, so the raid represents almost half those killed. One in 10 of was under the age of 13. Seven-year-old Doreen Herring saw a Luftwaffe plane flying overhead as her family, from Pendleton, made their way to an air raid shelter. They looked up and saw the pilot pause and then the plane sped ahead without dropping a bomb. "I am convinced it was because he could see us," she said. Her father, George Pinder, refused to go to the air raid shelter and said: "If a bomb wants to get me, it will get me." They were terrified of seeing if their house had been damaged when leaving the shelter. "Next door to us had been bombed to bits. "All you wanted to do afterwards was to have a cup of tea." She remembers there were a lot of children's funerals and the disgusting smell of rotten food after the bombing ended. "You could breathe again," she added, when the raids were over. People coped by cooking using broken furniture in their gardens that they would burn on fires to create heat. If water mains were damaged, they would drink water from bowsers. Father George Street, 34, who had spent all night helping people amid the bombing, died when the church of St Augustine in York Street took a direct hit. A collage of mangled chalices and church items is now on the wall of the new church in All Saints Place, off Oxford Road. The current incumbent, Father Dave Lannon, said Father Street had offered his usual chair to another priest. Had he stayed there "he would have survived". Geoffrey Whittle was 12 when he was evacuated twice from the home he shared in Gorton with his grandmother to the leafy suburbs of Bramhall. However, he hated it there - his hosts imposed a "cruel" regime of being forced to eat the previous day's leftovers - and he was back in Gorton when the raid took place. He remembers closing all the curtains when the air raid sirens went off and being scared of any light showing through. "We were all settled in this brick shelter about 500 yards away from the house in Greave Street, Gorton. Then this man would play the piano accordion and sing war songs. "Everyone would be singing along and I don't remember getting any sleep in the shelter." Susan Jones, 16 at the time, was shopping in Ancoats as the bombs started dropping. She watched pieces of shrapnel hitting the buildings and sparking and bouncing off. She took refuge in the shelter near the Avro Manchester factory, where she was working as a riveter and driller on Lancaster bombers. The sight of several cockroaches scuttling across the shelter led her to volunteer for fire warden duties on the factory roof. "The shrapnel started coming down and one bit hit a wall of one of the big mills," she said. "I could see sparks and I was hugging the wall to try and stay safe. I wasn't frightened because of my age at the time, I thought I was indestructible and found it dead exciting." One of her relatives was hit in the face by an incendiary device during the raids, but survived. "It was a dreadful thing," she said of the Christmas Blitz. "I looked up at the sky and it seemed like everything was on fire. There was an acrid smell of burning and from the guns. The sky was all orange and yellow it looked like the fireworks I'd seen at Belle Vue when I was younger." Historian Ian Kikuchi, from the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford, said there had been few fatalities in Manchester until the Christmas Blitz. "The heaviest bombing previously had been in the East End of London," he said. "The Luftwaffe launched bombings across Britain as they were trying to disrupt food supply and were targeting ports and centres of distribution." Mr Kikuchi said the Germans bombed Coventry in November 1940 because of its strategic position in heavy industry, but the focus soon shifted to other cities across Britain. He said the raids had been anticipated by British intelligence. "What was surprising was the intensity of the raids," he said. "The Luftwaffe saw Manchester as an adjunct to the port of Liverpool, which was a major industrial centre."	As the Christmas of 1940 approached, German bombs rained down on Manchester city centre, killing hundreds of people and causing widespread destruction.
It is the first time an unsigned artist has won the honour - which has previously gone to Adele and Sam Smith. "I can't believe this is happening," said the 23-year-old, from south London. "It's all just so ridiculous!" Four of the top five Sound of 2017 acts are black British women, reflecting a rise of female talent in grime and R&B. Ray said she wanted her music to "empower women to live life as they want". "There are so many societal pressures on women, on how we should behave, and they're all based on male privilege." The Sound of 2017 list was chosen by a panel of 170 DJs, critics and festival bookers. Among them was Jamal Edwards, whose SB:TV YouTube channel has helped launch the careers of Dizzee Rascal, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran. He said he was "blown away" when he saw Ray BLK perform at one of his club nights last year. "She is the whole package," he said. "I know she's going to have an amazing year." "Some artists have that magic about them," said Radio 1's Huw Stephens. "She has a real, raw talent that cuts through so strongly. She is the real deal." Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Ray released her first recordings while studying for an English degree. She worked in an advertising agency to sustain her career in its early days. Combining her love of hip-hop and R&B, she delivers streetwise, literate lyrics with a velvety soul voice. Her standout track, My Hood, is a bittersweet love letter to her home town, Catford. "The south east is one of the roughest places in London but it rears the strongest people, and that's what makes us special," she said. The singer has avoided signing a record deal in order to retain the rights to her music, which she releases on her own label. Like an increasing number of artists, from Paul McCartney to the Pet Shop Boys, she works with a company called Kobalt Music Services - who provide "back-room" support like publishing and distribution, without tying musicians to restrictive contracts. "I feel as though I need to have my autonomy for now," Ray told the BBC. "There've been so many artists in 2016 that came out, who did so independently and experienced a lot of success. I think there's a new wave of people doing that. The industry is changing." The winning soul singer, whose real name is Rita Ekwere, beat blues singer Rag N Bone Man to top the Sound of 2017 list, while third place went to pop star-in-waiting Raye. Ray said: "I'm particularly proud to be a part of this year's list as it's full of so much talent, some of whom are independent artists like myself which I really hope inspires the next generation." The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine. According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching a solo career are excluded. Artists must not have had a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2016 - although guest vocalists remain eligible. Last year's victor was Jack Garratt, whose debut album Phase entered the charts at number three. He praised the "very diverse" range of acts on 2017 longlist, which also included agitprop rock band Cabbage and folk-pop ingenue Maggie Rogers. "This list shows it is possible to have a great ear for melody and not just write the same four chords in different keys. "2017 is going to be such an incredible year for art, especially given how terrible 2016 was for politics. "We've all got a lot to write about and I think we're going to write some incredible stuff."

Soul singer Ray BLK has topped the BBC's Sound Of 2017 list, which aims to predict the most exciting new music for the year ahead.
The 25-year-old former AFC Fylde player has scored 29 goals and assisted 19 this season and moves to the League One club on a three-year deal. Lloyd has been working for a waste disposal company alongside football. "I believe in my ability and believe this is a level I should be playing at. I wish it was 1 July already," he told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. "To be brutally honest it was a very easy decision to join Peterborough. Once I spoke with the gaffer about the way he wants to play, it's very similar to what I've been playing. "I think I'll fit in really well and he thinks I'll fit in really well. Everyone knows Peterborough United's track record and what they've done for lads from non-league. "First and foremost, this season's about working hard for the club and if the club do well, the lads will do well." Lloyd is Posh's second signing of the summer, and the second from non-league after the arrival of Ricky Miller from National League side Dover.

It was originally thought 60 people died when a government-allied militia tried to take over the Brak al-Shati base on Thursday. The UN-backed government's defence minister and the commander of the militia have both been suspended pending an investigation. The prime minister's office has denied ordering the attack. A militia spokesman said they had "liberated the base and destroyed all the forces inside". The town's mayor said some aircraft had been set ablaze. Most of the dead were soldiers of the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA), an alliance in the east of the country which does not recognise the government in the capital, Tripoli. That force has been in control of the airbase since December. Its spokesman gave the new death toll of 140. "The soldiers were returning from a military parade. They weren't armed. Most of them were executed," he said. The UN's envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, said he was "outraged" by reports of summary executions. The attack breached an informal truce between the rival forces that was reached earlier this month when the LNA's commander, General Khalifa Haftar, met the UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The Tripoli government has set up an investigative committee to present its findings to the prime minister within 15 days.	Reports suggest as many as 140 people, including civilians, may have died in an attack on an airbase in Libya.
A social media campaign had proposed giving Halti mountain summit to Finland for its 100th birthday next year. The border between the two countries runs up the mountain near its peak. But Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that sadly she had had to turn down the idea because the country's constitution prohibited any sacrifice of Norwegian territory. Part of Halti mountain is already in Finland - and forms its current highest point - but the peak is 20m (66ft) across the border inside Norwegian territory. Campaigners had proposed moving the border to give the summit, at 1,330m (4,363 ft), to Finland, saying the change would be barely visible on the map. They had argued that the peak "would be a wonderful gift to our sister nation" to mark its independence from Russia, and not a big loss to mountainous Norway, which has much higher peaks. The campaign's Facebook page got 17,000 likes, with support from both sides of the border. But it hit upon an insurmountable legal issue. "Border adjustments between countries raise challenging legal problems, among them linked to the Norwegian constitution," Ms Solberg wrote to Svein Leiros, the mayor of the town of Kaafjord in northern Norway, who supported the campaign. Norway's  1814 constitution stipulates that the country is "indivisible" - and apparently not even an area the size of a football pitch can be split off. "We will instead consider another suitable gift to Finland on its anniversary," the prime minister added.	Norway has rejected a plan to give its neighbour Finland a mountain to mark the centenary of its independence.
Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months. It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a "similar location and mechanism", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as "fracking", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: "We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. "We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that." The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: "Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. "It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity." The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: "The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. "Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site. "Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles). "The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."	Shale gas test drilling in Lancashire has been suspended following an earthquake on the Fylde coast.
The 58-year-old, who drew his first game in management with Bournemouth in 1992 on a plastic pitch at Preston, admits that a return to Stoke "could not have been scripted better". "Players live a different life now," he said. "In a world where they get everything, they've become film stars." Pulis managed the Potters for 464 matches over two spells and comes up against his old side with them bottom of the early Premier League table. But the Welshman - who has also managed Crystal Palace in the Premier League - expects current Stoke boss Mark Hughes to steer his side away from trouble. "You couldn't have scripted it better to be honest, the fact that I'm going back to Stoke," Pulis said. "It's fantastic. Whichever way the result goes, my 1,000th game will be at Stoke and I had great times there. "Everything changes so quickly. A couple of games and Stoke could be two-thirds of the way up the table. What you've got to do, and I don't have to tell Mark how to manage, is to keep your feet on the ground. Keep looking ahead, keep pointing ahead and hope that things change. "They have a very strong squad there and it's a surprise that they are down at the bottom. I'm sure they will get out of it - I just hope that it's not on Saturday that they start." Pulis first took charge of Bournemouth in the third tier of English football in August 1992, as the first Premier League season got under way. His big signing that summer was striker Steve Fletcher for £30,000. This summer he broke West Brom's transfer record to spend £13m on Nacer Chadli. He has been in charge for 277 Premier League games, 282 in the second tier, 258 in the third and 46 in the fourth. Pulis has also won games in the FA Cup, League Cup, Football League Trophy and the Europa League. "I could sit here all afternoon and talk about what has changed," Pulis said. "Human beings have changed, the world has changed. Professional football, especially the Premier League, is no reflection on real life to me now. "I would never have changed apprentices coming in and doing apprenticeships and realising how fortunate they are, even to be apprentices, never mind make the professional grade. But we can't change life - you have to move with the times. "Everybody wants change now. If you don't like a programme straight away you can turn it over. Years ago we had ITV and BBC and that was it. You were stuck with it. Today there are a million channels. "People are like that. You have a brand new phone, two months later a new one comes out and the lads are queuing up for it. I've had my phone for about 30 years and I still can't use it properly. "But I still love the game. I have been very, very lucky. I have been blessed really. I understand how lucky I have been." Never want to miss the latest West Brom news?

Contracts worth more than £400,000 have been approved for works at Slessor Gardens and at the rear of the Caird Hall, as well as the replacement of dock gates at Camperdown Dock. Dundee Waterfront is a regeneration project which is transforming 240 acres of land along the River Tay. Redevelopment is now well past the halfway mark. The work at Slessor Gardens, costing £250,000, will include the creation of the Discovery Walk of Fame, the commemorative Royal Arch of trees and the outline formation of the Waterfront Showcase Gardens. Contractor Sir Robert McAlpine was awarded the contract, which is due to be completed in January next year. Meanwhile, specialist consultant Mott MacDonald won a contract worth £150,000 to replace the existing dock gates to Camperdown Docks, as part of the City Quay Marina development. Will Dawson, convener of Dundee City Council's city development committee, said: "With a project as large, complex and lengthy as the redevelopment of the waterfront each element that is started or finished becomes something of a milestone." The overall project includes the construction of a new railway station, V&A Museum of Design Dundee, a new marina, port developments, offices, hotels, bars, shops, cafes and residential accommodation.	The latest stage of the £1bn transformation of Dundee's waterfront is getting under way.
Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of Saturday's match against Bournemouth after Bob Bradley's sacking. Swansea want to appoint their new boss as soon as possible, with ex-Derby manager Paul Clement the first choice. "We've got to go with somebody who will to get us out of trouble," he said. "If we were to go down - and there's obviously that possibility - you look at the Championship and it seems to have got a lot stronger. It's not a foregone conclusion [to go straight back up]. "I know Norwich and Burnley have done it but it's difficult. Newcastle look like they'll do it but they're a big, powerful club who can hang on to a lot of their top players. I'm not sure we'd be able to do that. "If we go down, it's going to be tough to get back." Swansea were promoted to the Premier League in 2011 and quickly established a reputation as a well-run club with a team that played exciting, possession-based football. Their promotion capped a remarkable rise from the brink of bankruptcy a decade earlier and almost being relegated out of the Football League altogether in 2003. Curtis - a former player who was at the club throughout their rise up the divisions - believes the Swans have not been the same since Michael Laudrup left in 2014. "I think we have [lost our way]. It's just the change of management all the time," Curtis added. "The best eras were Roberto Martinez, Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. But we've probably lost a bit of the 'Swansea Way'. It has been diluted. "We've lost quite a few players too but have we adequately replaced them?" Media playback is not supported on this device Curtis believes the current Swansea squad is good enough to stay up, and the 62-year-old reminds every new signing of how far the club has come. "I know a lot of the foreign boys have seen [the documentary] Jack to a King. So they've got a brief history of where we were and where we are now," he said. "They might not be 100% passionate about it but they know where we came from and how important it is [to stay up]. Not just for the club but for the whole area."	Swansea's caretaker manager Alan Curtis says there would be no guarantee the club would return to the Premier League if they were relegated this season.
Her previous attempt to change the law was defeated in parliament but she said the public now had better awareness of the issue. The Lothians MSP, who has Parkinson's disease, outlined her Assisted Suicide Bill in Edinburgh. The Scottish government has said it does not support a change in the law. And it is still unclear whether there is majority backing for the measure among MSPs. The bill's strongest critics have said it could see Scotland becoming a "suicide tourism" destination, along with other countries where the practice is legal, such as Switzerland. There have also been concerns it could fail to safeguard frail, elderly people. Ms MacDonald told the BBC she had learned lessons from her previous attempt to get a bill passed and had brought forward a clearer and more straightforward process. Her bill would allow people whose lives became intolerable through a progressive degenerative condition or terminal illness to seek a doctor's help in dying. There are also a series of safeguards which aim to prevent abuse of the legislation. The main measures in the bill include: Ms MacDonald said: "I decided as soon as we lost the last one that I had to get a better one and reintroduce it, because so many people think this is the right thing to do for people who have a progressive, degenerative condition who are facing a less than dignified end. "And people who are terminally ill, if they want to go just a bit sooner, they should be able to choose to do so without making anyone subject to prosecution." In 2010, Ms MacDonald's End of Life Assistance Bill was defeated by 85 votes to 16, with two abstentions, by MSPs who were allowed a free vote on the legislation, rather than on party lines. But Ms MacDonald said she hoped high-profile cases such as that of Tony Nicklinson in England, who had locked-in syndrome and battled for years for a legal right to end his life, had increased awareness. And she pointed to last year's report from the Commission on Assisted Dying - set up and funded by campaigners who want to see a change in the law in England and Wales - which said the current system was "inadequate". Ms MacDonald said she was "pretty certain" support for her bill among MSPs had grown since 2010. Her new bill is launched a day after opponents of assisted dying from across Europe met to speak out against the move. The Euthanasia Prevention Coalition Europe, convened in Brussels, included the Scottish group Care Not Killing, an alliance of 50 groups, including faith-based organisations, which is strongly opposed to Ms MacDonald's proposals. It is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt, which is almost identical to the situation in Northern Ireland. The Director of Public Prosecutions has to approve any assisted suicide court action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 2010, Keir Starmer, then the DPP, issued guidance that made it clear that family or friends who travelled with a loved one to the Swiss suicide group Dignitas would not risk prosecution. The guidelines were the result of a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill woman, who in 2009 won a legal ruling requiring the DPP to set out whether her husband would be committing an offence if he accompanied her to Dignitas to end her life. Scotland's prosecution service, the Crown Office, has issued no such guidance. Assisted suicide is legal in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as Switzerland. Q&A: Right-to-die debate Care Not Killing convener Dr Gordon Macdonald said: "The Scottish Parliament overwhelmingly rejected an attempt by Margo MacDonald to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide in 2010. "MSPs concluded that vulnerable people would be put at risk from such legislation. "Scotland can learn from the damaging effects of legalising euthanasia and assisted suicide in other parts of Europe and North America. "Europe can learn from Scotland's example as a country which has rejected the view that some people's lives are not worth living. We believe that society has a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable." It is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. The Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales, which is almost identical to the law in Northern Ireland. Outside Scotland, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has to approve any assisted suicide court action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 2010, Keir Starmer, then the DPP, issued guidance that made it clear that family or friends who travelled with a loved one to the Swiss suicide group Dignitas would not risk prosecution. Ms MacDonald is pressing ahead with her fresh bill after getting the necessary 18 signatures from other MSPs to bring it to parliament. She is officially launching the legislation at an event in Edinburgh, along with MSPs representing all the political parties and Silvan Luley, of Dignitas. Assisted suicide is legal in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as Switzerland. In the House of Lords, the Labour peer and former UK Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, has proposed a bill on legalising assisted suicide.	Proposals to give terminally ill people in Scotland the legal right to assisted suicide have been relaunched by the independent MSP Margo MacDonald.
Hadleigh Parkes and Gareth Owen went over for the Welsh side in the first half and Scarlets were good value for their 15-9 lead at half-time. But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays. But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half. Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: "I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. "The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. "From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins. "I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home. "That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really. We got in behind them when Maselino [Paulino] had the big break and we bombed a try." Leinster: Rob Kearney; Zane Kirchner, Garry Ringrose, Noel Reid, Cian Kelleher; Ian Madigan, Isaac Boss; Cian Healy, James Tracy, Mike Ross, Devin Toner, Tom Denton, Dominic Ryan, Sean O'Brien, Jamie Heaslip (capt). Replacements: Bryan Byrne, Jack McGrath, Marty Moore, Hayden Triggs, Dan Leavy, Luke McGrath, Johnny Sexton, Ben Te'o.

Scolari, 65, won the tournament in 2002 but the hosts could only finish fourth at this year's event. Brazil were thrashed 7-1 by Germany in the semi-finals then lost 3-0 to the Netherlands in the play-off. "Luiz Felipe Scolari and his fellow coaching staff surrendered their positions to the board," the CBF confirmed in a statement. "Scolari and his entire coaching staff deserve our respect and gratitude. "They were responsible for returning to the Brazilian people your love for the national team, despite not having achieved our greatest goal." Scolari's contract was set to expire after the tournament, but the CBF vice president Marco Polo del Nero last week offered the manager his full backing following the humiliating last-four defeat by Germany. However, Scolari himself had offered no assurances about his position in the wake of what he called "the worst day of my life". I'm not sure how much he has quit and how much he has been pushed but from the minute that fifth Germany goal went before the half-hour mark, he was already the ex-coach of Brazil. It's impossible to preside over an extraordinary, historic humiliation of that magnitude and carry on as coach of Brazil. Scolari first took over the Brazil side in 2001 and guided them to World Cup success a year later, beating Germany 2-0 in the 2002 final in Yokohama, Japan. But after spells in charge of Portugal, Premier League side Chelsea, Bunyodkor of Uzbekistan and Brazilian club Palmeiras, he resumed control of the national team in 2012. Brazil hosted and won the Confederations Cup in 2013, beating Spain 3-0 in the final, and were favourites to win a sixth World Cup. They finished top of their group after two wins and a draw from their three matches, before edging past Chile on penalties in the last 16. They beat Colombia 2-1 in the quarter-finals, but lost top goalscorer Neymar to a spine injury and captain Thiago Silva to suspension. In the semi-final, Brazil were 5-0 down to Joachim Low's Germany after only 29 minutes, before losing 7-1 - their joint-heaviest loss ever and first home competitive defeat for 39 years. Vice president Del Nero is scheduled to take over from CBF president Jose Maria Marin next year, which could mean a delay in the naming of a successor to Scolari - Brazil Under-23 coach Alexandre Gallo has been suggested as an interim caretaker. Those expected to be in contention for the full-time job include former Corinthians boss Tite, Muricy Ramalho of Sao Paulo and ex-Brazil boss Vanderlei Luxemburgo - all of whom were in the running after Scolari's predecessor, Mano Menezes, was sacked. Bayern Munich's Spanish coach Pep Guardiola was linked with the job before taking charge of the German champions, but Brazil have never appointed a foreign manager.

It relates to Vodafone's 2007 takeover of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa's Indian mobile unit for $11bn (Â£6.5bn). Indian authorities have said the firm owes nearly $2.2bn in taxes over the deal, a claim the firm has disputed. India's top court ruled in favour of Vodafone in 2012, but the government changed laws later that year to allow firms to be taxed retrospectively. That development was criticised by investors and also triggered concerns among many foreign firms looking to enter India. Vodafone's Dutch subsidiary acquired a 67% stake in CGP Investments Ltd, a Cayman Islands registered company which held the Indian telecom assets of Hutchison in May 2007. Vodafone has long claimed that the deal was not subject to any taxes in India as the assets were held by a firm based in the Cayman Islands. However, the Indian authorities presented it with a tax demand of 112bn rupees - equivalent $2.2bn at the time. The Indian government subsequently also sought penalties of up to 100% of the original bill.	Vodafone has sought international arbitration to resolve its tax dispute with the Indian government.
The two men in their 40s went missing on Tuesday as they climbed the 4,248-metre (13,937ft) Mont Blanc du Tacul. The weather is thought to have worsened suddenly. Reports say they had taken the difficult "Devil's Ridge" route. Mont Blanc, with 11 peaks above 4,000m, is Western Europe's highest range, and a challenging area for climbers.	Two German climbers froze to death while attempting one of the peaks of Mont Blanc in the French Alps and rescuers have recovered their bodies.
Lt Col Lucy Giles, 46, will be at the helm at New College to help prepare young British Army officers for their chosen regiments. She said: "I have to pinch myself really, because it's an enormous privilege to be in this unique position." The academy was founded in 1947 after two older military institutions merged. Lt Col Giles from Wincanton, Somerset, will oversee the academic programme and the physical training aspects of the intermediate and senior terms of the course. The married mother-of-two said: "It's interesting to see people's reactions in this traditionally male environment. I'm a mother and wife of a soldier, so I am bound by juggling those domestic considerations as well as delivering a day job, so to speak." She said she would "lead by example" and encourage permanent staff to "try and make time for their families". During her 24-year career Lt Col Giles has led soldiers on operations and deployments in Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, East Timor, South Africa and Northern Ireland She spent two years as the first female Officer Commanding at 47 Air Dispatch Squadron. She said: "I like to think I was boarded for this appointment because I had the right key skills, knowledge, and experience to be able to do this effectively, as opposed to me being here because I'm female. "Although, I recognise that being in this position means I may come across as a role model for our future female officers." Famous royals to have trained at Sandhurst include Princes William and Harry.	The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst has appointed the first female college commander in its history.
Davies, 32, joined in 2015 and skippered the Staggies to League Cup final success in his debut season. He lost the captaincy at the beginning of this term and was seeking a return to his native north-east of England, due to family matters. But since then he has started all but one Premiership game for County. "We are delighted that Andrew has chosen to extend his stay at the club," said County manager Jim McIntyre. "Andrew's family are very settled and happy in the area now and it's a huge boost to have a player of his stature commit his future to the club for another two years. "Since he arrived in Dingwall, Andrew has been first class for the team and probably one of the best and most consistent centre halves in the division."	Ross County defender Andrew Davies has signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Dingwall club until the summer of 2019.
The emergency services were called to Glenapp Road in the Pollokshields area of the city at about 11:50. Two people were taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. They are thought to have been suffering from smoke inhalation. Other residents from the flats received medical assessments at the scene.	A fire in a block of tenement flats in Glasgow has left two people requiring hospital treatment.
Figures shared with 5 live Investigates by the charity RoadPeace reveal a 23% drop in prosecutions in England and Wales in the five years to 2015. In the same period the number of convictions fell by nearly 30 per cent. The charity blames a reduction in the number of specialist police officers. The number of road officers in England and Wales fell by nearly 40 per cent from 7,100 in 2005 to 4,350 in 2014. The Department for Transport said: "Britain has some of the safest roads in the world and in 2015 we had the second lowest total of road fatalities on record. "We are determined to do more and we've recently announced tougher penalties for those caught using a mobile phone while driving. "We have also tightened the law to make it easier to prosecute drink-drivers and drug-drivers." Five people die on the UK's roads in the UK every day but campaigners say these incidents are often seen as unfortunate accidents and prosecutions are few and far between. John Thompson's 27-year-old son Jake died from head injuries in 2011 after he was hit on a pedestrian crossing in Bristol by a lorry travelling at 38mph in a 30mph zone. The family had to fight to persuade Avon and Somerset Police to re-open an investigation into Jake's death after the Crown Prosecution Service said there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against the driver. John is highly critical of the original investigation. He said: "We thought straight after the crash there would've been statements taken. It was about a month before the witnesses were interviewed, the phones weren't checked, the interview of the driver didn't take place until about two or three months afterwards and the interview failed to meet the standards which you would expect. "There hadn't been a proper investigation. They hadn't followed up on certain key leads like CCTV evidence; they hadn't checked the driver's medical history". When the case was eventually taken to court in 2014, it was thrown out, with the judge ruling that there was no case to answer. "I felt hurt, disappointed", said John. "It was almost as if Jake's life had been lost but there were no consequences as far as the legal system was concerned". A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: "After the collision involving Jake we carried out an investigation which, when reviewed, was found to have fallen below standards. Following a complaint raised by Mr and Mrs Thompson we recognised and accepted the need to revisit these matters. "As a result, the investigation was re-opened and we renewed our appeal for witnesses, reviewed the information we already had and looked to see if any new lines of enquiry had presented themselves in the interim period. Improvements have since been made in respect of how we approach these types of investigations." RoadPeace believes that the declining number of prosecutions for careless and dangerous driving reflects the police's increasing reluctance to investigate fatal collisions. "Police are not evaluated on their collision investigation performance. Hence it is not a priority," said Amy Aeron Thomas from RoadPeace. "There are no national standards for collision investigation, not even for fatal crashes. Guidance exists but has been weakened in recent years. It is not clear how police evaluate their investigation effectiveness, or if they even do evaluate this." The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) - a charity which advises MPs on road safety - wants the government to create a UK road collision investigation branch. This would be similar to existing organisations which investigate air and rail crashes, and would have the remit of reducing the number of road casualties. Steve Barry, an Assistant Chief Constable at Sussex Police and the National Police Chief's Council lead for collision investigations, says he doesn't believe that the reduction in the number of traffic police has impacted on the number of prosecutions and convictions. He supports the idea of a national investigation branch but says there is a now a very different approach to road safety. "It's less focused on enforcement and prosecution, it's more focused on what is in the public interest, in terms of educating the public, diverting them away from the court. "We need to learn how to keep ourselves safe on the roads, as oppose to prosecuting our way into a situation of better safety. "The balance is between justice and public interest, or learning, and that's a really difficult balance to explain to a [bereaved] family, but what we have to try and explain is there is a balance between justice, for the victims, justice for the families, at the same time of getting as much evidence, as much learning out of it that informs how we keep other people safe on the roads in future." 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 2 April at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio.

Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to investigate the actions of undercover officers. A review is ongoing in England and Wales, but the UK government has refused to extend it to Scotland, leaving Mr Matheson "disappointed". Victims of police spying had called for a Scottish inquiry to be set up. Holyrood's parties had been united in calling for an extension to the Pitchford Inquiry, which was set up in England and Wales to investigate allegations of misconduct by undercover officers. There are allegations that undercover Metropolitan Police officers had fathered children and caused miscarriages of justice, with claims of this activity extending to Scotland. Mark Kennedy, one of five officers known to have had relationships with women while undercover, is alleged to have infiltrated environmental groups ahead of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005. Labour MSP Neil Findlay wrote directly to the policing minister, Brandon Lewis, but was told that it was "not possible" to extend the probe north of the border for "a number of reasons". Mr Matheson said he was "firmly of the view" that extending Pitchford would be the "right thing to do", and said he was "disappointed" with the UK government's refusal. He said: "Given the operational extend of the units involved, the Scottish government believes that a single coherent inquiry is the most effective approach to provide a comprehensive investigation into these activities. "However, in light of the Home Office's decision I have today directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to undertake a strategic review of undercover policing in Scotland." The justice secretary said this investigation would cover "the extent and scale of undercover policing in Scotland" dating back to 2000, as well as operations carried out by the Met Police units under investigation by Pitchford. He added: "This review will also give independent assurance on the operation, procedures and safeguards in place by Police Scotland in relation to undercover policing." The Scottish Liberal Democrats welcomed the news, with Liam McArthur describing the probe as "nothing less than required". But Mr Findlay said it was "minor progress", calling it "the police reviewing the police" rather than the public inquiry he had called for. Victims who are participating in the Pitchford Inquiry had hit out at the decision not to extend it to Scotland, calling on Holyrood to order its own probe. A group of 17 victims issued a joint statement after Mr Lewis refused to extend the inquiry saying they were "extremely frustrated", saying it "sets the inquiry up to fail before it even begins". One of the group, Merrick Cork, added: "It's outrageous that Theresa May thinks victims of police abuse deserve justice in England but not in Scotland. "The police admit English officers committed human rights abuses against citizens on Scottish soil. It's absurd to expect public trust in police when abuses of power are swept under the carpet, and it's a snub to Scotland to say it doesn't matter there." Mr Lewis defended the limited scope of the inquiry, saying it was "extensive and complex" already, and needed to "proceed swiftly" without further delays. He added: "The Home Office is confident the inquiry can both gain an understanding of historical failings and make recommendations to ensure unacceptable practices are not repeated without a need to consider every instance of undercover policing, wherever it was taken."	The Scottish government has ordered an independent review of undercover policing in Scotland.
He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel. But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration - the sign broke and cut the leg of a line judge. Nalbandian was disqualified for unsporting behaviour and the match was awarded to his opponent Marin Cilic. After the match, Nalbandian admitted he went too far saying, "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court." Maybe he should think about a new career in sport - karate perhaps?	Argentinian tennis player David Nalbandian might be wishing he'd kept a lid on his temper.
The MSP will make the pledge in her keynote address to the Scottish Labour conference in Perth. Ms Dugdale believes new taxes would not be necessary to pay for the plan. She will advocate changes of approach such as ditching SNP plans to cut air passenger duty and Tory proposals to raise higher rate tax thresholds. Ms Dugdale will say that parties in Scotland must "get serious" about what they would do with the major new tax and welfare powers coming to the Scottish Parliament. The MSP reckons the restoration of tax credits could be achieved by making different choices in government. At the Holyrood election in May next year, the Scottish Labour Party will be defending the 38 seats it holds. Ms Dugdale will tell her conference that a vote for her party would offer a break from Tory austerity. She will add: "Scottish Labour will stand for the elections with a promise to restore the money Scottish families will lose from this Tory tax rise on working families. "We will act as soon as the new powers make it possible. We don't need to tax ordinary Scots more to make this change. "We just need to make different choices from the Tories and the SNP." The Scotland Bill, currently going through the UK parliament, will contain new powers for Holyrood, including; On the first day of the three-day conference Labour's UK leader Jeremy Corbyn urged voters in Scotland to back a "left wing alternative" at next May's Holyrood election. Mr Corbyn also said it was right that decisions about the party north of the border should be taken by members and activists in Scotland. He has signed an agreement with Ms Dugdale pledging a more autonomous structure. Who would join Scottish Labour - a party with just one MP north of the border and a poor showing in the polls? Five young people - attending the Scottish Labour conference in Perth - tell BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim (@BBCPhilipSim) what's making them stick and not quit.	A future Labour government at Holyrood would restore tax credits for working families, its Scottish leader Kezia Dugdale will tell party members.
Researchers believe achieving a healthier weight could cut the risk by a fifth in breast cancer. Around 3,200 women will take part, with half of them shifting a tenth of their body weight. Experts said the trials were vital as it was still unclear if weight made a difference. Dr Jennifer Ligibel, from the women's cancer centre at the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, said: "We have known now for many years that women who are overweight or obese and are diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher risk of their cancer recurring and ultimately dying." She said this had been seen in more than 100 studies, though the explanation for it was unclear. She said preliminary evidence showed that losing weight after diagnosis could be helpful. But the idea has never been tested in a large randomised trial, considered the gold-standard of medical research. The two-year trial will start recruiting overweight and obese patients, with a BMI of at least 27, in August. After their cancer therapy is completed, the women will have regular advice from dieticians to help them reduce their calorie intake to 1,200-1,500 calories per day. Eventually, they will also exercise for up to 250 minutes a week. For every 100 women in the study who do not lose weight, they expect to see 23 have a recurrence of the tumour. If the researchers are right, then they expect only 19 in every 100 women who did shift the pounds to have a recurrence. Dr Ligibel added: "I think it would be premature to say we know these things make a difference and that's why studies are important. "I am quite convinced but I think we need the data to really prove it, but also to look at who benefits." It is far from clear what changes inside an obese body could be leading to cancer recurrence, but there are theories around levels of the hormone insulin or inflammation, both of which are altered with weight gain. If the concept is confirmed then it could apply to a wider range of cancers. Prostate and colorectal cancer incidence is already known to be closely connected to waistline, however, patients with tumours such as lung or skin cancers, which are linked to carcinogens, may not benefit. Dr Harold Burstein, an American Society of Clinical Oncology spokesman and breast cancer doctor, said there was "mixed evidence" on weight. He argued: "There is a tendency to overstate the benefit, as yet there's no real known benefit for these interventions - that's why they're doing the trials." "It's not clear that if you change your weight after a breast cancer diagnosis that it affects the breast cancer coming back. "Either because it doesn't matter, or the damage has already been done, or the tumour is what it is and does its thing regardless of what you're eating." Meanwhile, a study presented at ASCO has suggested chemotherapy is less effective in obese women with breast cancer. A team at a Turkish hospital analysed data from 295 patients to show obese women were both less likely to respond to treatment and more likely to see their cancer return. There was a complete response in 31% of normal or underweight patients compared with just 17% in the obese group. And the disease returned after an average of 76 months in obese patients compared with 150 months in those of normal weight. Dr Ali Riza Sever, one of the researchers at the University of Hacettepe's oncology centre, told the BBC News website: "It tells us obesity is an adverse factor when it comes to chemotherapy before surgery. "Obesity puts you in a more disadvantaged situation." Follow James on Twitter.	The first major trial to see if losing weight reduces the risk of cancers coming back is about to start in the US and Canada.
The number of pedestrians and cyclists hurt in accidents fell by more than a third between 2012 and 2016 - but the rate was lower in 20mph zones, the city council said. The council said it will now evaluate the effectiveness of existing zones. It also agreed to spend the Â£687,000 road safety pot on alternative schemes. Since 2014, a 20mph limit has been introduced on more than 1,000 roads and around 138 schools in the city. This has cost the council about Â£640,000, according to a BBC Freedom of Information request. It led to an average speed reduction of 0.7mph in these areas but the "amount of accidents experienced in 20mph zones has not fallen as quickly as initially hoped", the council said. For example, casualties of cyclists on the city's roads fell by more than 40% between 2012 and 2016 but the drop in 20mph zones was notably lower - 16% in Gorton and 12% in Miles Platting, Newton Heath, Moss Side and Fallowfield. Last year, one person in Greater Manchester was convicted for exceeding the speed limit in a 20mph zone, police said. While the review is undertaken, money for road safety will be spent on other traffic calming measures and pedestrian crossings. Councillor Rosa Battle said: "It's important that we fully understand how effective these zones have been in terms of reducing accidents so far." Rod King, director of 20's Plenty for Us, welcomed the report but said it was "incorrect to use early, small number datasets which are not statistically valid and compare them to whole city totals".	A plan to expand 20mph zones across Manchester is to be reviewed after their impact on reducing the number of accidents was called into question.
Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as "an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?" Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a "witch hunt" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: "Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations." How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. "I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy," says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. "But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous." Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, "cocaine is against the law of the land". There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: "We can't have a belt held hostage." One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. "Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him," was Hatton's grim assessment. "He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. "But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same." Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.	For a man often described as capricious, Tyson Fury's chaotic reign as world heavyweight champion was strangely predictable.
Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks "resilience". South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have increased by 16% in the last year. It claimed staff shortages contributed to problems in answering calls. In a risk assessment report published by OCCG, it said: "Patient safety in the 111 service will be compromised due to performance issues caused by a lack of resilience to peaks in demand." OCCG has ranked the phone line as a "red risk", the highest category for risks to patient safety. It comes after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph in June recorded a worker at SCAS's 111 call centre in Bicester, Oxfordshire, saying all staff had "killed someone indirectly". After the report prompted an investigation in January, the Care Quality Commission said the service was "safe and effective". The ambulance trust said that a 16% increase in call volume meant phone handlers could not answer calls "as quickly as we would like". In January alone, the service received 173,563 calls on both their 999 and 111 phone lines. SCAS has also said that a recruitment shortfall has contributed to issues in responding to calls. A spokesperson added: "We are working hard to improve our response to the patients who require our assistance. "We are continuing to recruit staff to the NHS 111 service across our area." SCAS provides ambulance services for Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire.	The safety of patients using the 111 service in Oxfordshire could be "compromised", according to the county's leading health body.
Measuring 50cm x 76cm (19.6in x 30in), it was bought by a Welshman living in England at Rogers Jones & Co auctioneers in Colwyn Bay on Saturday. Its guide price had been £200-£300. The poster features soldiers beside a cannon, with the caption: "Anibyniaeth sydd yn galw am ei dewraf dyn" - or "Independence calls for its bravest man" in English.	A World War One recruitment poster written in Welsh has sold at a Conwy county auction for £440.
Reports of a "mass murder" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. "It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. "Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable." Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a "personal life crisis". In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: "There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. "We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised." Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. "Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context." But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.	The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?
Jon Rahm's status as one of Europe's most exciting prospects was confirmed by a fine victory on the PGA Tour at Torrey Pines last Sunday. The 22-year-old capped his maiden triumph with a thrilling eagle at the last, where he holed a snaking 60-footer to finish three clear of the field. Rahm, who hails from Barrika in the Basque country of northern Spain, has made an extraordinary start to his professional career. He secured his Tour card within just four events of joining the paid ranks seven months ago. Having completed a stellar college career at Arizona State, where he won the prestigious Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus awards, the youthful Spaniard was third at Congressional last year before finishing runner-up at the Canadian Open last July. His rapid rise accelerated further with this victory over a strong field in California. It is little wonder Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Thomas Bjorn, was among the first to recognise the achievement. "Congratulations on your first PGA Tour win," Bjorn tweeted. "When you win, you might as well do it in style! What a finish." It is a significant result for Bjorn because it has elevated Rahm into the world's top 50. All indicators suggest the Spaniard, currently ranked 46th, is likely to remain in this upper echelon for many years to come. And with a place in the top 50 comes the freedom to pick and choose tournaments on both sides of the Atlantic. With his PGA Tour card secure, the Spaniard is on schedule to be free to accept European Tour membership in time for next year's Ryder Cup. Rahm has already stated his desire to play for Europe in Paris and under new rules would only need to play four events each season to satisfy the Tour's membership criteria. "I've thought about the Ryder Cup a lot," he said during the World Cup at the end of last year. "I so want to play in the matches; who doesn't? But right now I need to establish myself on the PGA Tour." That task has already been accomplished with astonishing speed and it means the 2018 Ryder Cup can be firmly on Rahm's radar. "The next one is in France and that is close to home for me," he said last November. "I will be doing all I can to be there. So to answer your question: yes, I will be joining the European Tour at some stage. "I am very much a European, and I want to play there. But I have taken a different route to professional golf in that I have gone to college in the US. "Once I have the freedom to fly back and forth a bit more it will happen. It is my dream to represent Spain in the Ryder Cup." Phil Mickelson's brother Tim coached him at Arizona State and is now the Spaniard's agent. Phil is convinced his sibling has unearthed a golfing gem. "I think there's an intangible that some guys have where they want to have the pressure, they want to be in that tough position," Mickelson said. "They want to have everything fall on their shoulders. And he has that." Before Rahm's sensational finish, Woods was the last player to win at Torrey Pines by making eagle on the closing par-5 back in 1999. Now the 41-year-old continues his latest comeback amid so many reminders the game is now being dominated by a much younger generation. Aside from Rahm's triumph, there have been PGA Tour successes this year for Justin Thomas (aged 23) and Hudson Swafford (29). Woods is heading for the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour where a similar story has been developing. After 26-year-old Tommy Fleetwood's Abu Dhabi victory, the 21-year-old Korean Jeunghun Wang collected his third title by winning in Qatar last Sunday. This week, of course, the largest galleries will gravitate towards Woods even though the 14-times major champion was less than convincing in his PGA Tour comeback last week. Rounds of 76 and 72 led to a missed cut and it was clear that understandable rust remains after such a lengthy lay-off. Woods has won twice in Dubai, but this time making the cut would represent satisfactory progress. He is playing the second of four events in a hectic five-week schedule. How his troublesome back stands up to the rigours of a 17-hour flight to the Middle East, even in the comfort of his private jet, will be Woods' primary concern. But the magnificent Majlis course at the Emirates Club, still the best in the Middle East, will provide an ideal test as he continues to feel his way back into Tour level competition. It will be fascinating to follow his progress but, given the way things are going, do not be surprised if he is overshadowed by someone nearer half his age by the time we get to Sunday's final round.	While Tiger Woods inevitably generates a frenzy of interest during his return to the European Tour, the continent has already got plenty to be excited about thanks to a new Spanish superstar in the making.
Scrum-half Murray took a heavy blow to the head in a tackle but was allowed to return to the field after belatedly being sent for an assessment. However, Munster say Murray showed no signs of concussion. Recently, Northampton were found to have breached rules by allowing George North to play on after a head injury. Sale are currently being investigated for an incident involving TJ Ioane. European Cup organisers confirmed to BBC Sport that an Untoward Incident Review Group will convene early this week to decide whether Munster had broken concussion management protocols. Munster insist Murray was assessed at the time of the incident and did not appear to be concussed. The club said upon further review of the footage by Munster medics, he was removed for a head-injury assessment as a precaution. He passed that and returned to the field of play and subsequently passed a second head-injury assessment after the match. The 14-12 victory over Glasgow means Munster are now guaranteed to top Pool One, sealing a quarter-final place in Europe's elite tournament for the 16th time in 22 seasons.	Munster will be investigated over their management of Conor Murray's head injury in the European Champions Cup victory over Glasgow on Saturday.
Two sections of the A3055 Undercliff Drive suffered landslips in February 2014, creating a three-mile detour between Niton and St Lawrence. Some residents, frustrated with delays, resurfaced the road themselves in October 2014, but the council shut it again for safety reasons. The authority says the new route will only be open for local access. The landslide, which happened during work to repair the road, caused eight homes to be evacuated. The council said the collapse was caused by unusually heavy rain in an area of "known land instability" where there had been numerous landslips in the past. The authority's planning committee has approved a new route, slightly inland, providing full access for local residents' vehicles, walkers, cyclists and horse riders, but closed to through traffic. The work will be carried out by the authority's contractor Island Roads under an existing Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deal. The company said the work would last eight weeks. Resident Tim Wright said the solution was a "temporary scheme" which failed to address drainage problems. The council said "retaining the existing drainage arrangements for the highway would not increase the potential for ground movement to occur". Planning chairman Bob Blezzard said he hoped in the future there would be another application for the road to be "fully reinstated".	A main road on the Isle of Wight is to be repaired more than two years after it collapsed due to heavy rain.
Oxfordshire County Council has joined forces with new operator HourBike Ltd to bring back the OxonBike scheme, which has 30 cycles available to hire from seven locations around Headington. The Â£150,000 project was originally launched in June last year, but the two-year pilot was cut short five months later when operator Grand Scheme Bike Share went into liquidation. Hourbike will run it for a year. David Nimmo Smith, the county's cabinet member for transport, said: "When the scheme launched last year around 500 people signed up, so I am sure that those people will be very keen to get back in the saddle. "Commuters who use Thornhill Park and Ride and who travel in and around Headington to places like the universities and hospitals will find OXONBIKE particularly useful." The cost of hiring the bikes is free for the first 30 minutes. The scheme has been funded by the government through its Local Sustainable Transport Fund.	A bike hire scheme has been relaunched in Oxford six months after it folded.
Knox, 30, has arranged a practice round at Augusta with the 1988 winner. "It's not every tournament you have a fellow Scot and past champion to show you around," Knox told BBC Scotland. "I'm looking forward to it and hopefully he'll give me some great insider tips that he's learned over the years that might help me." Lyle, 58, qualifies as a winner of the Green Jacket, and US-based Knox is the only other Scotsman in the field. Inverness-born Knox leapt up the rankings in November with victory at WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai and is currently No.34 in the world. "I still can't quite believe I'm playing at the Masters," he enthused. "Growing up watching it on TV, now it's my turn to play. It's truly an amazing honour." Knox has had a taste of the other majors, finishing in a tie for 45th at the US Open in 2013, featuring at the US PGA Championship in 2014 and 2015 and making his Open debut as a reserve at St Andrews last year. "I've only been to Augusta once before," explained Knox, one of British golf's most promising players. "It's the most famous course in the world pretty much. Obviously, St Andrews is right up there too. "Being the first major of the year and with all the history, Augusta just has this hype around it and golf is in a great place right now with so many young, amazing players. "There's such a buzz around the tournament. The crowds seem amazing and then there's the condition of the course. "The whole thing is magical, a golfer's dream, and I can't wait to be a part of it."	Russell Knox aims to tap into the experience of former champion Sandy Lyle as he prepares to make his Masters debut next week.
Manchester City climb from fifth to third after a 2-1 win over Swansea City, with Liverpool dropping one place to fifth after a 2-0 defeat at lowly Hull City and Manchester United remain sixth after a 3-0 win at Leicester City. Elsewhere, there were wins for Sunderland away to Crystal Palace, Everton against Bournemouth, West Ham at Southampton, Watford against Burnley and West Brom at home to Stoke City. Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends. Do you agree with my team of the week or would you go for a different team? Why not pick your very own team of the week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends? All that nonsense about Chelsea handing Arsenal the title when they sold Petr Cech to their rivals couldn't have been further from the truth. The Gunners were mauled at Stamford Bridge. There were two moments of inspiration from Arsenal which resulted in two world-class saves by Thibaut Courtois. A wonderful tip over the bar from a Gabriel header in the first half and a brilliant save from a Danny Welbeck effort in the second made it absolutely clear that the Blues, and Courtois in particular, were determined to slam the Premier League door on Arsenal's fingers. Courtois has only conceded seven league goals at home all season while Arsenal appear to be giving goals away like they are going out of fashion. Chelsea have bolstered their challenge by taking a point at Liverpool and all in the space of four days. Petr Cech eventually lost his place at Chelsea to Courtois and now we see why. Chelsea have invested in youth and look like winning titles again. There are a number of reasons for West Ham's resurgence, not least because they have the good fortune to play away from that dreadful ground they call home. The departure of Dimitri Payet has served to galvanise the dressing room, Andy Carroll has been immense since his return to the side, but doesn't make my Team of the Week because of better performances elsewhere, and the ever-present Michail Antonio. This young man has had a very impressive season acknowledged by an international call-up. Manager Slaven Bilic has also had to rely on players like Mark Noble, Winston Reid and Cheikhou Kouyate to haul them free from what was a perilous time for the Hammers. Their victory against Southampton was as good as it gets, bearing in mind they went 1-0 down early in the game. A manager simply cannot put a value on a player who is available week in, week out and Antonio is one of them. His link-up play with Carroll was a feature of West Ham's game at St Mary's and Southampton's downfall. This lad wasn't even supposed to be on the pitch. However, one of the benefits of being a foreign manager is Marco Silva will probably have a healthy network of international scouts who can plunder the January transfer window. Enter Andrea Ranocchia - a last-minute replacement for the injured Michael Dawson. Silva had every right to panic when he realised he was going to be without his captain for a vital fixture against Liverpool but he needn't have bothered - Ranocchia was absolutely superb at the back for the Tigers. Some pundits have criticised the appointment of Silva, claiming he didn't have the credentials to manage in the Premier League. His performance so far suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Liverpool's season is over which makes me curious about Jurgen Klopp's remarks about his players needing to 'wake up'. I don't know if Klopp is in charge of transfers but he is certainly responsible for selecting the team. He has continually refused to fix an inadequate defence [if he had done, the title was there for the taking] and had no appreciation of how seriously teams in this country take the FA Cup. And he has the audacity to tell his players to wake up. Back from the Africa Cup of Nations and boy was Lamine Kone missed. The sheer presence of the Ivory Coast defender at the back for Sunderland was immediate, but did anyone expect the central defender to make such a difference on his return or to open the scoring against Crystal Palace? As for the Eagles, I thought that the sacking of Alan Pardew was premature and by definition the appointment of Sam Alladyce a little early. What Big Sam went through during the England departure would have knocked anyone's confidence and a little more time for him to rehabilitate might have been wise. I wonder if the former Bolton, Newcastle and Blackburn manager has lost a bit of his mojo. His team certainly have. This lad is having a fantastic season. How ironic Marcos Alonso's Chelsea debut was against Arsenal, but he is a very different player now than he was then. The mere fact that it was the left wing-back who responded the quickest to the loose ball and bulldozed Hector Bellerin in order to get it says as much about manager Antonio Conte as it does his team - Chelsea are hungry and ruthless. The very thought of Arsene Wenger considering that the challenge on Bellerin by Alonso was a foul makes me think that the Arsenal manager is starting to lose his perspective. No referee who wanted to keep his credibility would have given a free-kick. Besides, it was a brilliant challenge by Alonso and an excellently taken goal. I have an enormous regard for Wenger and his achievements but when you start squaring up to fellow managers and pushing officials you really have to consider whether a break from the profession might be the healthy option. I also sense restlessness among the fans and it would be a great pity if Wenger was forced out instead of given a dignified exit. There's a lot to be said when an individual can identify the time to move on. To see this player in full flight with the ball at his feet is a sight to behold. Not since the great Laurie Cunningham have I seen a player who runs as quick with the ball at his feet as he does without it. His goal against Leicester is fast becoming a trademark for Henrikh Mkhitaryan. When the Armenia midfielder took off inside his own half , skipped around a stranded Robert Huth and headed towards Kasper Schmeichel in goal, you instinctively knew it was going to end badly for the Foxes. Mkhitaryan hits the ball so well on the run and in full stride - it is a wonderful attribute and one I won't get tired of seeing. This game wasn't about revenge - this was about something far more important than that. This was about putting Arsenal out of the title race and that's precisely what Chelsea did. After all, they had been to Anfield four days earlier and made it abundantly clear to Klopp that you need more than an enchanting smile and a pressing game to win the Premier League title. You need an N'Golo Kante in midfield and two central defenders who can defend. Against Liverpool it was David Luiz who received the plaudits but it was Kante's continual interceptions that caused the damage. And so it was against Arsenal. This 'silent force' is fast becoming my player of the season. He may not have the skill of Eden Hazard or the explosive game of Alexis Sanchez but what he does have is a winning mentality. The Frenchman now looks set to be the first player to win the Premier League title with two different teams in consecutive seasons. I think that in itself deserves special praise. Should Juan Mata have been sent off? Probably. The fact that he wasn't had more to do with it being Mata rather than Granit Xhaka of Arsenal, for example, who was sent off recently for a very similar tackle. To say reputations don't matter is rubbish. Of course they matter. The Spain international is a dreadful tackler and has no business ever going to ground. However, the difference between Mata and Xhaka was that no-one was hurt. Had Mata inflicted damage then that would have provided a different dynamic for the referee. The result was that United's midfield maestro along with his accomplice Mkhitaryan continued to take Leicester apart. I've said before in this column that Leicester are playing with fire. Not to take the Premier League seriously, or worse, allow it to play second fiddle to the Champions League, is a betrayal of their fans. Leicester still have time to stop dreaming about European glory and secure their status in the greatest league in the world. Nothing should threaten that. David Moyes is a very lucky man to have Jermain Defoe leading his attack. I can think of half a dozen Premier League clubs who wanted Defoe's services. The reason Moyes has him is because he inherited the signing and the Sunderland manager is astute enough to resist whatever overtures he's had during the transfer window in order to keep him. The transfer threat has gone for now and just as well because the Black Cats have a monumental relegation fight on their hands. In fact they don't come much bigger than against Crystal Palace, nevertheless Sunderland absolutely destroyed them. To be 4-0 up at half time must have been a glorious feeling for Defoe, who took his goals with the usual dexterity. Defoe is Sunderland's Premier League lifeline. However, the question is, can they keep him? It's pretty impressive when a striker scores a hat-trick but it's something entirely different when he scores four goals in a top-class fixture.  I must say when I saw the way Romelu Lukaku buried his first past a stranded Artur Boruc, I thought 'he fancies it today'. What preceded that glorious strike was finishing of the highest order. Everton have had some wonderful strikers over the years: Joe Royle, Andy Gray, Graeme Sharp and now Lukaku, it would appear, is about to join that band of iconic names. The only problem for Lukaku is the aforementioned actually won trophies while playing for the Toffees. Scoring goals is the most difficult thing to do in football but winning trophies is what characterises careers and that must be the next item on the striker's agenda. I promised myself that I wasn't going to mention words like miracles and redemption when talking about Gabriel Jesus, but it's extremely difficult when those terms are somewhat relevant. The fact that Manchester City beat Swansea at all was rather fortuitous. The young Brazilian certainly had big shoes to fill as he had replaced Sergio Aguero in City's starting line-up. I don't know what is going on at City but it doesn't look like a happy camp to me. When Pep Guardiola continues to play around with team formations, [which is his prerogative], leaves his best striker out and substitutes Kevin de Bruyne [who looked far from happy], you start to question his motives. Is he losing patience with his stars and putting 'faith' in those more likely to do precisely what he says? Whatever the reason, and there will be one, Guardiola may have found a saviour in Jesus. Sorry but I couldn't resist it!	Chelsea beat Arsenal 3-1 to stay nine points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Tottenham remain second after a 1-0 win at home to Middlesbrough.
Aker Solutions said employees had been told about 650 positions, mainly in the UK, Norway and India, may be affected. A more specific breakdown for Aberdeen and London jobs has not been announced. A spokesperson said: "The adjustments are being made because of the continued market slowdown and as part of a global reorganization that will strengthen the company's competitiveness." Aker employs about 15,000 people, of which more than 2,000 are in the UK, the majority of them in Aberdeen and offshore.	Hundreds of jobs are set to go at oil services firm Aker Solutions with about 100 at risk in Aberdeen and London.
The witness also said her family had been forced to move to Spain to escape her daughter's alleged abusers. Sheffield Crown Court also heard how police lost tapes of an interview with defendant Sageer Hussain in 2003. Eight men, including Mr Hussain, deny sexually abusing three girls between 1999 and 2003. The mother of one of the alleged victims said in a statement: "Her character changed from a lovely girl to an animal. She became horrible." She said at one stage she discovered a mobile phone in her daughter's bedroom and rang a number stored under the name 'Waleed'. She said a man picked up the phone and said "I ain't done owt, I ain't touched her. It isn't me". When she asked her daughter about the phone she said she burst into tears and said "They're raping me, they're raping me". She told the court after her daughter went to the police in 2003 her family were repeatedly threatened. "We were so distraught that we sold the business and the home and moved to Spain," she said. Det Con Andy Stephanek, of South Yorkshire Police, told the court the force had lost the tape of an interview with Mr Hussain when he was first questioned about the allegations. He said it appeared that "due to the passage of time they've been destroyed". The trial continues.	A woman who was allegedly raped and abused by eight men in Rotherham changed from a "lovely girl to an animal", her mother told jurors.
Membership of the Labour Party has soared since the general election and Mr Corbyn believes most of these new members are his supporters. The hope of his opponents is that many may have become disillusioned with his leadership. But having spent a day in Leeds meeting new and older members of the local party, I found scant evidence for this. If anything, Mr Corbyn's supporters seem ever more determined to defend him. So who are these new members; the so called "Corbynistas"? I spent time with four of them: Jane Ingham , 65, a retired head teacher, Ged Colgan, 26, a hotel worker, Marvina Newton, 30, a local charity manager and Jane Aitchison, who is in her 40s and is a trade unionist. What quickly became clear was that, not only was Jeremy Corbyn the main reason they joined the Labour Party, but they remain fiercely loyal to him. Mr Corbyn, they believe, offers inspiration and change.  In the past Labour had become too similar to the Conservatives; particularly over austerity, they say. Jeremy Corbyn represented a break with the traditional way of doing politics "He's unlike anyone," says Marvina. "To me that's what is great about him. He speaks from the heart. " What was also clear was the disdain all four had for those Labour MPs seemingly determined to oppose Jeremy Corbyn. "Unfortunately they have been part of a style of politics that has not only failed to win elections but they have been consistently wrong about a whole range of issues," says Ged. Jane the retired head teacher is similarly unimpressed. "I'm quite disappointed with the MPs. Do too many of them have too many privileges and just enjoy the privilege of being members of Parliament?" And there's no disguising the fact these new members are prepared for a fight should Labour MPs continue to refuse to back Mr Corbyn, if he wins this leadership contest. No-one mentions the D-word, deselection. But the warning signs are clear. "It's perfectly legitimate for local members to choose who they want to be their candidate at the next election," warns Ged. "I don't see why being an MP should be treated like a job for life." Jane, the trade unionist, agrees. "They (the MPs) do feel threatened. We represent change and Jeremy represents huge change and that threatens their very cosy position." So what of longer-serving party members? How do they view this influx of pro-Corbyn new members ? Away from the city centre in one of Leeds' more deprived areas, Seacroft, a rock-solid Labour area, I met up with two long-standing party members: Les Wrigglesworth, a former miner, and Melvyn Burton. They both praise the energy and enthusiasm of the new recruits. However they are more cautious over how committed these new members will remain to the Labour Party. Les says they may prove "fair weather" members. They are both dismissive, however, of claims that many of the new members are so-called "entryists" from Trotskyite and other hard-left groups. Les dismisses the idea as a "red herring". There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority. Melvyn believes the new members may be "naive" in their views but they are not Trotskyists. It's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership. Some regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party. The difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point. Many Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party. But if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds.	There's no disguising the confidence in Jeremy Corbyn's camp about this leadership election.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 in April 2013. As part of the prosecution's summing up, medical examiners gave graphic details of the injuries suffered by those who died in the attack. Mr Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if found guilty. Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified that the youngest victim of the attacks, eight-year-old Martin Richard, received injuries to every part of his body. The testimony was illustrated by autopsy photos and the child's bloody, torn clothing. Mr Nields said one piece of shrapnel appeared to have gone straight through Richard's body. "It would be difficult to say the precise location due to the size of the openings in the abdomen," he testified, according to Reuters. The defence began calling its own witnesses later on Monday. Earlier in the trial, the defence made the surprise admission that Mr Tsarnaev had participated in the attacks. But defence lawyers argue that his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, had been the driving force behind the attacks. By doing so they hope to spare their client the death penalty. Mr Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings. The brothers set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line. Mr Tsarnaev is also accused of fatally shooting a police officer three days later. The prosecution says Mr Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya, had extremist views and wanted to hit back at the US in revenge for military action in Muslim countries.	The prosecution has rested its case in the trial of a man accused of carrying out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) apologised for racial stereotyping for using a fake terrorist shouting "Allahu Akbar" in the mock terror attack. Organisers of the meeting at Longsight Saath Saath are demanding an inquiry. GMP said it has no plans to issue any further statements on the training exercise staged at the Trafford Centre. The scenario for the mock suicide bombing was by an extremist Daesh-style organisation although GMP had said the event was not linked to any specific terror threat. Syed Azhar Shah, who chaired the meeting attended by about 30 people, said GMP assistant chief constable Garry Shewan's apology was not enough and "only acceptable" if those responsible resigned. He said while the training exercise was a good idea but it was "shocking to portray Muslims as terrorists" and that only one group would commit terrorist acts. He said: "It is also shocking what our children and community who live in this country will see themselves as; terrorists or British citizens?" Mr Shah said further events would be held to "condemn this" and "ensure this would not happen again". He said one apology "would not mend so many hurts". One of those at the meeting said using a Muslim as a terrorist sent out "the totally wrong message" and "puts a wedge" between the community and GMP. "We are all British citizens. As far as Islam is concerned it does not permit any killing." Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner Tony Lloyd, said it was "frustrating" the operation had been "marred by the ill-judged... and unacceptable decision" to have the terrorist shout 'Allahu Akbar' before setting off fake bombs. Other locations in the three-day counter-terrorism exercise include Redbank Community Home in Newton-le-Willows.	Police have been accused of "institutional racism" for portraying a suicide bomber as an Islamist terrorist, a protest meeting heard.
Cornish-born Glover was meant to be back with  winning partner Heather Stanning, but Glover, 27, won the  with Swann last season. "We had a whole year together last year so hopefully it'll click into place," she told BBC Radio Cornwall. "It's clicking into place fairly easily, we just need to get back onto the same page technically and get doing the same things." Swann replaced Stanning last season after she Glover and Swann won three World Cup events together last season as well as the world title in South Korea. And with a good performance in Amsterdam, Glover says there could be some tough decisions for the Great Britain selectors as to who partners her in the coxless pair for the rest of this season. She said: "It's going to be a quite interesting one with Heather coming back after taking a year out with the army and Polly staying here. "There's lots of selection things about who will be in the pair out of those two. "But I want to keep my eye on the World Championships at the end of August in Amsterdam. "It'd be great to try and hold on to our world champion title, whoever else is in the boat with me."	Helen Glover expects her partnership with Polly Swann to develop quickly as they prepare for the European Championships in Belgrade.
Media playback is not supported on this device Scottish full-back Stuart Hogg ran in the opening try but Leigh Halfpenny's three penalties and a slick Rhys Webb score put Wales 16-10 up by half-time. A disallowed Liam Williams effort and a missed Halfpenny penalty gave Scotland hope that they could recover. But Jon Welsh's late try was not enough after Jonathan Davies had powered over. Wales are now back on track to mount a championship challenge, but despite the Scots' improvement, they still seem a little short of the Six Nations heavyweights. Warren Gatland's side arrived in Edinburgh reeling from that loss to a patchwork England side. Scotland also began the tournament with a defeat, to France in Paris, but there was enough in their display to give their fans hope they could beat Wales for the first time in the Gatland era. The Scots had spoken of keeping the penalty count down, but they conceded three in the first five minutes, one of which was kicked by Halfpenny to give Wales the lead. As the Welsh began to build pressure, they were hit by a breakaway try. Alex Cuthbert lost possession and Richie Gray shipped the ball wide to Hogg, who showed great speed to race past the cover defence and score under the posts. Laidlaw's conversion and a subsequent penalty put the Scots 10-3 up before Halfpenny responded with a three-pointer of his own. Scotland lost fly-half Finn Russell to the sin-bin on the half-hour when he was judged to have taken out opposite number Dan Biggar with a dangerous tackle in the air. Halfpenny brought the score to 10-9 with the resultant penalty. Wales did not take long to make their one-man advantage count, a sweeping move from inside their own half stretching the Scots' defence to breaking point, and scrum-half Webb diving over in the corner. Halfpenny added the extras to put Wales 16-10 up at the break. Two Laidlaw penalties either side of a successful Halfpenny kick kept the Scots within three early in the second-half. Wales had a Liam Williams try ruled out for an off-the-ball infringement by Alun Wyn Jones, but the referee could not save Scotland 15 minutes from the end when Davies scored Wales' second try. The British and Irish Lion came on to a Biggar pass at pace and, after powering through some soft midfield tackling, the centre coasted under the posts to leave Halfpenny with the simplest of conversions to give Wales a 10-point lead. That looked to have ended the match as a contest, but the Scots refused to buckle, with Mark Bennett and Hogg making searing line breaks. They did force a try in the dying seconds when Welsh ploughed over from close range, but it was too late and once again the home side had to be content with the 'gallant losers' tag. Scotland: Hogg; Lamont, Bennett, Dunbar, Visser; Russell, Laidlaw; Dickinson, Ford, Cross, R Gray, J Gray, Harley, Cowan, Beattie. Replacements: Scott for Dunbar (58), Hidalgo-Clyne for Laidlaw (71), Reid for Dickinson (61), F Brown for Ford (71), Welsh for Cross (50), Hamilton for R Gray (56), Strokosch for Beattie (58). Not Used: Tonks. Sin Bin: Russell (32). Wales: Halfpenny; Cuthbert, J Davies, Roberts, L Williams; Biggar, Webb; Jenkins, Hibbard, Jarvis, Ball, A Jones, Lydiate, Warburton, Faletau. Replacements: M. Phillips for Webb (74), James for Jenkins (71), Baldwin for Hibbard (60), Andrews for Jarvis (60), Charteris for Ball (60), Tipuric for Lydiate (61). Not Used: Priestland, S Williams. Sin Bin: J Davies (37). Att: 67,144 Ref: Glen Jackson (New Zealand).	Wales recovered from their opening Six Nations defeat by England to secure a hard-fought win at Murrayfield that leaves Scotland without a point.
The frontier is shut but Turkey has said it is prepared to feed and shelter the refugees. In the past few days, the Syrian army backed by Russian air power has made a series of gains in Aleppo province. The advance threatens to encircle the city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, landing a major blow to the rebels. Nato has accused Russia of "undermining" Syrian peace efforts through its strikes, which it says are mainly aimed at opposition groups. But Russia insists it only targets what it calls terrorists. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Russia of being engaged in an "invasion" of Syria, saying it was trying to create a "boutique state" for President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of the Kremlin. Mr Erdogan said Russia and the Syrian government were together responsible for 400,000 deaths in Syria. Turkey and Russia have been embroiled in a row since Turkey shot down a Russian jet it accused of violating its airspace in November. According to the UN, up to 20,000 Syrians have gathered at the Bab al-Salam border crossing. "Humanitarian organisations are responding to the needs of those displaced, but ongoing military conflict is making access to populations in need increasingly difficult," the UN's Linda Tom told the AFP news agency. She said another 5,000-10,000 displaced people had gathered at Azaz, a north-western Syrian city close to the Turkish frontier. March 2011: Anti-government protests erupt across Syria, but Aleppo is initially untouched due to a state crackdown February 2012: As the rebellion turns into a conflict, clashes between rebels and the government are reported with increasing frequency in Aleppo province July 2012: The battle for Aleppo begins. Rebels make swift advances, but are unable to consolidate their gains and the city becomes divided 2013: The government begins bombarding rebel districts with barrel bombs, causing thousands of casualties September 2015: Syria launches a fresh offensive in the wake of Russia's intervention in the conflict February 2016: The government captures towns north of Aleppo, threatening to encircle the city Aleppo profile Separately, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said 15,000 people had arrived at the border. In a televised speech, he said Turkey would not leave them "without food or shelter" but would not say if they would be allowed in. Friday saw further gains for the Syrian government on the ground, recapturing the town of Ratyan, north of Aleppo. Earlier in the week, it claimed a major victory by breaking the rebel siege of two towns in Aleppo province, severing an opposition supply line from Turkey to Aleppo city. "It feels like a siege of Aleppo is about to begin," said a spokesman for aid group Mercy Corps, David Evans, who said the main humanitarian route was cut off. Since 2012, Aleppo has been divided into rebel and government-held areas. Before the conflict it was a key commercial centre and home to over two million people. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, the so-called Islamic State group, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called "moderate" rebel groups, which are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.	At least 15,000 Syrian refugees fleeing fighting in northern Aleppo province have gathered at a border crossing with Turkey, UN and Turkish officials said.
The regime said 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's medical condition was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he was given after his trial. But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated "brutally". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a "severe neurological injury" and is in a stable condition. "We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto," Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. "It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. "Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care." Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a "war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied "on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a "trophy" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? "When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release," he said. "We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over." The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining Americans as political pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang has accused Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its regime. Three Americans remain in custody in North Korea. The detentions have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours.	The emotional father of a US student freed by North Korea this week says he does not believe the regime's explanation for his son's coma.
Seam bowler Chapple, 40, has played for the Red Rose county for more than two decades and led the side throughout Moores's five-year reign. He will be assisted by ex-Lancashire spinner Gary Yates, who was already on the club's coaching staff. Lancashire return to Championship action at Northants on Sunday. He's taught me a lot about the game, about what you see from the sidelines when you're not a player, and in that respect he's inspired me to want to stay in the game Moores left his position as head coach following the Division One fixture with Warwickshire, which ended in a draw on Wednesday. The 51-year-old will now begin his second spell with the national team, having been in charge for nearly two years before his dismissal in January 2009. Speaking prior to Friday's announcement, Chapple told BBC Radio Manchester that working alongside Moores has increased his desire to stay in the game at the end of his playing career. "I rate him very highly as a coach," Chapple said. "The lads are very pleased for him because he's been terrific for us as a coach. We wish him every success. "He's taught me a lot about the game, about what you see from the sidelines when you're not a player, and in that respect he's inspired me to want to stay in the game. "My role will inevitably be bigger because Peter's not here, but at the same time I've been involved in team selection for five years now. "We've got a lot of resources at the club and a lot of highly qualified coaches, and we'll back ourselves to be great until the club tells us anything different."	Captain Glen Chapple will take control of Lancashire for the rest of the 2014 season following the departure of Peter Moores to become England boss.
