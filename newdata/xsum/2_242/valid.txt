The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, said plans for 16 routes were on hold. The schemes being "reconsidered" to make sure they are "deliverable and affordable" are part of an £11.4bn investment announced in 2014. Neither the NAO or Department for Transport have said which are at risk. Highways England, which is responsible for major roads, has identified the 16 schemes that could be cancelled, delayed or redesigned, the NAO said. The NAO concluded that several problems were created by the plans being drawn up in just 17 months in order to publish them before the May 2015 general election. The equivalent rail planning takes about 30 months. The spending watchdog also claimed the Department for Transport (DfT) chose projects without knowing enough about whether they represented the best use of taxpayers' money. The Five-year Road Investment Strategy featured 112 major projects to begin before 2020, such as smart motorway upgrades and converting single-carriageway A-roads to dual carriageways. The overall plan includes: Edmund King, president of the AA, said motorists would be frustrated about delayed upgrades and that the public should be told which of the plans have stalled "so that they know if they are stuck on a road to nowhere". The director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, Steve Gooding said: "Highways England has had a mountain to climb in gearing up for the scale of work involved, so it shouldn't surprise us that in some respects it is still in the foothills." Among the major plans are: A further 54 schemes are scheduled to start in 2019-20, which would cause significant disruption to motorists, increase prices and put pressure on resources at Highways England, the NAO said. Its report stated that by August last year the amount by which forecast costs exceeded available funding had reached £841m. But Highways England chief executive Jim O'Sullivan said he was confident the organisation would complete the work without overspending, and a "delivery plan" would be published in June. The DfT said it would consider the findings of the report.	Upgrades to some of England's busiest roads, including a controversial tunnel past Stonehenge, could be scrapped because they are not value for money.
Ian Duncan, who is expected to be appointed as a Scottish Office minster, said the devolved nations should be able to "see exactly what is going on". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said he was in a "constructive" frame of mind as talks with the EU began on Monday. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for a more inclusive approach to the negotiations, And she said warned Mr Davis that a failure to pursue the "common-sense" objective of keeping the UK in the single market would put jobs, investment and living standards "on the line". Voters in Scotland backed the UK remaining in the EU by 62% to 38% in last year's referendum, but in the UK as a whole voters supported leaving by 52% to 48%. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Duncan was asked whether Ms Sturgeon or Holyrood's Europe Minister Mike Russell should have a seat at the negotiating table for the Brexit talks. He replied: "Yes, I have no problem with that. I think that should be a common approach to all the home nations so that they can see exactly what is going on." The politician added: "But more importantly, they need to make sure that they have a seat at the discussion point in London when these positions are being hammered out because that is where the detail will be determined not actually inside the room." Mr Duncan stood in the general election in Perth and Perthshire North, where he lost to the SNP's Pete Wishart by 21 votes. He is expected to be appointed to the House of Lords and made a Scotland Office minister, with Tory sources saying he will bring a wealth of fishing and farming experience to the UK government as Brexit talks begin. It is not clear if he will stand down early from the European Parliament. As the began talks in Brussels, Mr Davis said he was determined to build a "strong and special partnership" with the EU. Subjects for the negotiations include the status of expats, the UK's "divorce bill" and the Northern Ireland border. The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019 following last year's referendum vote. The Scottish government wants Scotland to remain in the EU - and in particular the single market. But the UK government has insisted that Scotland will leave alongside the rest of the United Kingdom. Speaking during a visit to University of Strathclyde research centre, Ms Sturgeon said it was "troubling" that the UK government had "no authority and no clear idea even amongst its own ranks of what it's trying to achieve" as the negotiations began. She said: "We need to see a different approach to these negotiations if they are not going to end up being damaging to our economy. "We need a more inclusive approach that involves voices from every part of the UK, including the Scottish government, and we need an approach that has a common-sense objective. "In my view, that common-sense objective should be keeping the UK in the single market because leaving the EU shouldn't mean jeopardising hundreds of thousands of jobs, shouldn't mean jeopardising investment and it shouldn't mean putting living standards on the line." Ms Sturgeon said discussions between the Scottish government and the UK government had taken place following the general election in which Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority. She said: "These will continue but I think it's now time, not just for the Scottish government but for voices across Scotland and across the UK, to come together to say to the UK government that they cannot continue to lead the UK down a path with no clear idea of what they are trying to achieve and a path that could be so damaging. "So, let's have a more inclusive approach and an approach that focuses on keeping the UK within the single market." Ms Sturgeon refused to be drawn on her plans for a second independence referendum after the loss of 21 SNP seats in the election, only saying she would continue to reflect on the result, listen to a range of different voices and come to a conclusion "in due course". Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler said there should be a "way and a mechanism" for the UK government to consult with the devolved nations on the Brexit talks. She added: "That would mean that in the consultation, just like what the EU is doing with the parliament and the council, that the devolved nations are also involved in that consultation. "So whatever way the UK government is going to do it I want transparency and there is no transparency about the way the UK is conducting itself."	The Scottish government should have a seat at the Brexit negotiating table, a Conservative MEP has said.
Russia has denied that its military is involved in Ukraine, but Mr Poroshenko said 9,000 of its troops were deployed. Clashes involving tanks took place in two areas west of Donetsk on Wednesday. There was a "colossal threat" that large-scale fighting would resume, the president told parliament in Kiev. The outbreak of violence, in the government-held towns of Maryinka and Krasnohorivka, was among the worst in eastern Ukraine since a ceasefire was signed in Minsk in February. International monitors from the OSCE said that in the hours before and during the fighting around Maryinka a large amount of heavy weapons was spotted moving towards the contact line in rebel-controlled areas. Government troops fired shells at rebel-held areas on the outskirts of Donetsk. Ukraine said it had lost five soldiers in the past 24 hours, while the rebels said 15 people including civilians had been killed. The separatists denied Ukrainian claims that they launched a major offensive in violation of a truce. The OSCE said that for more than an hour on Wednesday they had tried to contact separatist leaders to halt the fighting, but they were either "unavailable or did not wish" to speak to the monitors. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, accused the authorities in Kiev of jeopardising the Minsk agreement, by placing it "under the constant threat of disruption" and by refusing to engage in direct dialogue with separatist leaders. The Kremlin has consistently denied sending serving soldiers across the border, although it has acknowledged that "volunteers" have joined the rebels. If there is a spike in fighting, like the battle in the town of Maryinka on Wednesday, then both sides know they cannot be seen as the aggressor, because they lose credibility and damage the negotiating position of their allies in either Moscow, or in European capitals. Neither side wants to be seen as responsible for breaking the highly publicised, but so far unsuccessful, Minsk peace agreement. And bargaining power for either side will become ever more crucial because in three weeks the European Union will decide whether to renew sanctions against Russia. Read more from Tom In his annual address to parliament, Mr Poroshenko warned of a "colossal threat" from the rising violence. "Ukraine's military should be ready for a new offensive by the enemy, as well as a full-scale invasion along the entire border with the Russian Federation," he said. "We must be really prepared for this." More than 6,400 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since the conflict began in April 2014 when rebels seized large parts of the two eastern regions, following Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula. Mr Poroshenko said Ukraine had 50,000 troops in the east who were able to defend the country. What he described as the Kremlin's "plan to sow separatism in south-eastern Ukraine" had failed, he added, and only persisted in areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions because of "Russian bayonets".	President Petro Poroshenko has told MPs the military must prepare to defend against a possible "full-scale invasion" from Russia, amid a surge of violence in eastern Ukraine.
Jamie Topliss-Yates was struck by a car driven by Zaid Bhamji at the BP garage in Chanterlands Avenue in Hull. Bhamji, 21, received a six-month suspended prison sentence after admitting dangerous driving. Mr Topliss-Yates said he feared the incident had left him with long-term health issues. His head struck the car windscreen as he was thrown over the top of the vehicle and he is waiting to have a brain scan to see if there is any neurological injury. More on this and other Hull stories Mr Topliss-Yates said he had no chance to avoid the car and thought he was going to die. "Literally the last thing that went through my head before I actually hit the car was to try and brace myself and try and jump on to the bonnet," he said. Bhamji was sentenced at Hull Magistrates' Court last week over the incident, which happened on 14  January. It was estimated he was driving at between 20mph and 30mph. Mr Topliss-Yates said he would have liked to have seen the driver jailed as "a few months inside would have made him stop and think". "I was angry for a while because it seemed such a pointless thing to do," he said. "It upset me a little bit that the sentence was a suspended one, because you can't drive at that speed across a petrol station forecourt and think that that's OK."	A man who suffered a broken pelvis when he was run over at speed on a petrol station forecourt has said he is "upset" the driver was not jailed.
Jason Nelson, 32, admits killing Jordan Maguire, 20, at his Luton home, in a "spree of violence" on 26 May 2013 but claims it was done in self-defence. The former resident of Marsh Farm Estate in Luton has pleaded not guilty to murder, rape and sexual assault. A man who saw Mr Maguire stabbed three times said the accused "showed no regrets or remorse" afterwards. Luton Crown Court heard the attacks happened at Mr Maguire's home in Thrales Close between 18:00 and 20:15. The prosecution allege Mr Nelson was in the middle of a spree of violence, having sexually assaulted a 25-year-old woman in the stairway of some flats and then a 60-year-old woman in her flat. Witness Dennis Kamau said he and his girlfriend were looking to buy some cannabis when he came across Mr Nelson near the Nisa store on the estate. He took the pair to Mr Maguire's home where the men entered the house while the woman stayed outside. After the pair agreed to share a deal, they went to the kitchen where Mr Maguire removed a tin from a kitchen cabinet. Mr Kamau said: "The next thing I saw was a knife rise above and attack Jordan. "I saw the knife go into Jordan. Jordan acted all shocked. He stabbed him a second time." Mr Kamau told the jury the victim was then stabbed in the back by Mr Nelson who said "You little pussy" before putting the knife away and riding off on his bike. "I was scared, terrified and shocked," said Mr Kamau. Asked how the accused appeared, he said: "He showed no regrets or remorse." A stab wound to the chest had punctured Mr Maguire's aorta and he was fatally injured. The jury earlier heard Mr Nelson stayed for two weeks with a girlfriend in Ipswich before flying to his native Grenada and was later arrested in Trinidad.	A man who stabbed a drug dealer to death showed no remorse after the knife went in, a jury has heard.

Bertrand Denarie worked at hospitals in Bristol, Salford and Gateshead from 2013 until early 2015. An investigation by North Bristol NHS Trust found mistakes in 106 cases, including two that led to a delayed diagnosis of cancer. An NHS spokesman said "immediate action" was being taken, with patients "now receiving appropriate care". The results were all follow-up examinations where initial cervical screening tests had shown abnormal results and were collected in colposcopy clinics. The trust said it had contacted all the patients involved. A "final letter" with the findings of the investigation would be sent out to those involved soon. "We are aware that errors may have occurred in relation to the laboratory testing of cervical biopsies at four trusts," the NHS added. "These were discovered as a result of routine audit and are being investigated by the trusts concerned and NHS England, with the support of Public Health England." Of the 106 mistakes found in the Bristol cases, 87 of those led to "no harm" with 11 needing extra testing and two having delays in cancer diagnosis. Dr Denarie worked in Bristol at Southmead Hospital in two periods in from January to April 2014 and then later that year from May to July. He also reviewed cases from St Michaels Hospital in Bristol during those periods. Before Bristol, he worked at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead for nine months in 2013 and worked at Salford Royal Hospital for about four months at the end of 2014. A spokesman for NHS England said investigations at these two hospitals were at a much earlier stage. Salford Royal Hospital said it had identified three errors with the pathologist's cervical biopsy work, which "had the potential to lead to minor harm for the patients concerned". "We've been in contact with those three patients to apologise, explain the outcome of our review and discuss any changes we need to make to their treatment plan," said Dr Pete Turkington, medical director for standards and performance. "It's important for me to emphasise that we are confident no patient has experienced significant harm. However, we apologise unreservedly for any stress or inconvenience that this has caused." The General Medical Council confirmed they were investigating Dr Denarie and that a number of conditions had been placed on his licence. One of those specified he "must not report on any cervical biopsy specimens".	A pathologist is under investigation after a series of mistakes were made in cervical tests.
Children's services in the city have consistently been rated "inadequate" by Ofsted. Lord Warner was appointed as an independent commissioner last year to oversee attempted improvements. On Monday the council's cabinet approved plans that will see an extra Â£94m spent over three years. It includes Â£27.5m already announced for the 2015-16 financial year. New IT and upgrades to existing systems are also to be introduced, including mobile devices for all social workers. Under the plans, the number of front-line social worker posts will increase from 511 to almost 600 by March 2017. The authority has struggled to recruit enough social workers over recent years, particularly those with substantial experience. Councillor Brigid Jones, in charge of children's services, said the authority had previously relied on "emergency measures" to tackle staff shortages and the latest plan allowed it to approach the matter more "more strategically". "The biggest thing we need to get right is the recruitment. It's about getting the right staff here and keeping them," she said. Lord Warner is expected to publish his own report into the state of children's services in Birmingham next month.	Extra social workers and new IT systems are to be introduced in a bid to improve children's social care in Birmingham.
The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) has rated 295 institutions bronze, silver or gold according to their standard of undergraduate teaching. Bangor University was awarded gold, while five other colleges got silver. One - University of Wales, Trinity St David - got bronze. Aberystwyth University and University of South Wales opted not to take part. Across the UK, 59 institutions got gold, 116 silver and 56 bronze. Others received a "provisional" ranking, where there was not enough data for a full assessment. Bangor's vice chancellor John G Hughes said the ranking "reflects its impressive performance". The TEF is administered by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and degree providers could choose whether or not to take part. They were assessed on a range of measures, including teaching quality, student satisfaction, drop-out rates and whether students go on to employment or further study after graduating. A gold award means a university is of the highest quality found in the UK, providing "consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students", while the silver award was given for consistently exceeding "rigorous national quality requirements for UK higher education" and bronze was awarded to those that met these national requirements. Those awarded a bronze or higher are now set to be able to raise tuition fees, which currently stand at around Â£9,000. "Bangor has maintained a strong commitment to the delivery of high quality student experience for many decades," Prof Hughes added. "Not only do we link research and teaching, but we also provide personalised pastoral care, and provide variety and experimentation in our teaching and learning. "We strongly believe that students deserve to be exposed to, and to be stretched by, the rigour and intellectual challenges of problem solving within their disciplines." Dr Mirjam Plantinga, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Student Experience at University of Wales Trinity St David, said: "We are pleased that the panel has recognised good levels of student satisfaction with academic support, and assessment and feedback. "Together with a focus on employer engagement and our distinctive culture, our TEF result reflects positively on the key values that underpin the UWTSD student experience".	Only one Welsh university got the highest possible score in a new ranking of degree teaching standards.
Prof Yves Barde, from Switzerland, is renowned for his research into the way proteins in the brain work and their role in illnesses such as depression. Prof Barde, currently at the University of Basel, will take up his post at Cardiff University in September. It said science was an international business and "we're importing one of the most important stars." He was appointed under the Welsh government's five-year Ser Cymru (Stars of Wales) project to expand universities' research capabilities in the fields of life sciences, advanced engineering, and low carbon energy and the environment. Prof Barde received international acclaim in 1989 with the discovery of a gene which creates a protein - brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - which is involved in number of brain processes including memory. He has explored the the role of BDNF plays in healthy brain function along with dysfunction. Recently his team at the University of Basel focused on how some drugs can increase BDNF levels in specific areas of the brain. The research helped in the development of new drugs, including the first oral treatment of multiple sclerosis. Prof Barde says he hopes to develop his current research interests of using stem cells to understand how the brain works and also to explore mental health illnesses such as depression. He said: "Some of the work I'll be undertaking in Cardiff will be about understanding the meaning of the link between the nervous system and neurological diseases which currently remains pretty mysterious, particularly in the case of depression. "But alongside several outstanding research groups at Cardiff University, I will also aim to advance research using embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed somatic cells to advance understanding of neuronal dysfunction. "This is a really exciting time for me, and for advances in neurobiology and for science in Wales." Cardiff University is already widely recognised for research into stem cells. The university's chancellor and Nobel Prize winner, Sir Martin Evans, was the first scientist to identify embryonic stem cells. These are cells which are taken from an embryo and which can develop into many other types of cells that can then be adapted for a wide variety of medical purposes. There is some opposition to this research on moral or ethical grounds although the research has proved to be highly valuable in understanding many diseases. Cardiff University vice-chancellor Prof Colin Riordan believes the appointment will build on the university's strengths. "It is a testament to the university's existing strengths in neuroscience and stem cell research that we are able to attract a scientist of Prof Barde's calibre. "By working with others in his field, Prof Barde will be able to help Cardiff University tackle some of the biggest health challenges of our time." Prof Ole Petersen, director of the university's school of biosciences, told BBC Wales: "I'm delighted about this great prospect of fostering world-beating research. "Science is an international business. We see throughout Europe that countries with the most internationalised science do the best science. "And we're importing one of the most important stars." Economy and Science Minister Edwina Hart said: "A strong science research capability is vital to improving our economic well-being and securing a prosperous, healthy and sustainable future for Wales. "We already have a lot to be proud of in science and innovation in Wales but the Ser Cymru programme will help us build on that to develop a dynamic and strong base in Wales."	A £50m project to attract world-class scientists and their teams to Wales has made its first appointment.
Rescuers were continuing to clear fallen rock to get to the area where the two missing miners were thought to have been working, officials said. They were trapped 150m (490 feet) underground by a cave-in on Friday. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has offered his help, three days after the dramatic rescue of 33 miners in Chile. Deputy Mining Minister Jorge Espinosa said the searchers had hopes of finding the two missing men alive. "We hope to find the two other miners alive because they were in a spot that probably was not affected" by the cave-in, he told Associated Press news agency. Mr Espinosa identified the two workers who had been confirmed dead as Walter Vera and Paul Aguirre. He said the two missing men were Pedro Mendoza and Angel Vera, Walter's brother. President Rafael Correa promised to do "everything possible" to save them. "God willing, we will find them alive." The collapse at the Casa Negro gold, silver and copper mine, near the town of Portovelo, is thought to have been caused by a water leak which eroded structural supports.	Rescuers have found the bodies of two of four miners trapped underground in a gold mine in southern Ecuador.
The 18-year-old took four wickets on the third morning as Middlesex collapsed from 249-5 to 293 all out, to trail by 122 runs on first innings. Toby Roland-Jones then struck three times, dismissing both Zafar Ansari and Aaron Finch for ducks, to help drag the hosts back into the match. But Curran's career-best 71 not out saw Surrey to a lead of 356, on 234-6. During a chaotic morning, Curran started the rot by bowling James Franklin in the third over as Middlesex lost their final five wickets for just 44 runs. Surrey reached 47 without loss with relative ease but, when Roland-Jones bowled Rory Burns (39), the visitors lost their next three wickets without adding a run. James Harris had fellow Middlesex opener Dominic Sibley caught behind off the next over before Roland-Jones returned to trap Ansari and Finch lbw, leaving the visitors 47-4. After Jason Roy made an attacking 37, spinner Ollie Rayner bowled the England limited-over batsman, then removed Steven Davies (20) to swing the match in the host's favour. But an unbroken 126-run seventh-wicket stand between Curran and wicketkeeper Ben Foakes (50 not out) left Surrey firmly in control. Middlesex head coach Richard Scott said: "It sort of ebbed and flowed today. We didn't create the partnerships that we needed at the end of our innings. "But, then we bowled really well in that middle session and took quick wickets. At one stage, we looked like we might bowl them out and set up a chase. "But, Curran and Foakes batted really well and frustrated us and it clearly shows on this pitch when you get a partnership going, it's hard to get people out. Surrey batsman Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London: "It's a very good day for us. There was a stage in the middle where it didn't quite go to plan, but Sam (Curran) batted really well and I stuck with him. "I think we're in a good position in the game and hopefully we can drive it home tomorrow. "Sam bowled really beautifully at the start of the day and to take four quick wickets on this wicket is I think really difficult. "To be able to blast them out was perfect for us and allows us to boss the game."	Sam Curran starred with bat and ball to help put Surrey in a commanding position against Middlesex at Lord's.
It is understood the pilot reported problems with the hydraulics system. The issue was reported within minutes of the plane taking off from Belfast International Airport. The plane has now landed safely.	A United Airlines flight from Belfast to Newark has been diverted to Manchester Airport.
When Angie Konrad tweeted that the heating was switched off on her train, she did not expect the operators of that line to read the message and alert the driver to switch the heating on so she could enjoy the rest of her journey in comfort. Twitter is enabling companies to engage in a much warmer relationship with their clientele, but when things go wrong for the customer, it is also the best way to get grievances resolved quickly and in real time says comedian David Schneider, who is also a Twitter expert and runs social media consultancy That Lot. "If you're 29th in the queue on a phone call, only you know that. It's you and the person who's keeping you on hold. But if you tweet, it's public and it could be picked up, and I think companies are very aware of that," says Mr Schneider. Or catch up on BBC iPlayer A bad review or negative comment can be retweeted by millions, and companies are often keen to defuse customer anger very quickly in a public space such as Twitter. If it is done cleverly, it can even work in a company's favour. "I remember there was a time where there was an outage on O2 on the network and they were getting a hell of a lot of bad press," says Mr Schneider. "People were tweeting very aggressively at the O2 account and about O2 - it was trending. "They happened to have a very skilful, self-deprecating, humorous person on their Twitter feed at that time who dealt with the abuse in a very amusing way." Mr Schneider says it was interesting to see a wave of criticism turn to positive comments from the customers. When a complaint is treated with a personal touch, it can even go viral on Twitter. For instance one Argos customer service representative chose to reply to customer Immy "Badman" Bugti's complaint using the same street style he had used in his tweet. A shortened version of the messages read: "@Argos_online: Yo, wen you gettin' da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain't waitin' no more." "@BadManBugti: Safe Badman. We gettin' sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week, y'get me." The company response from Argos was retweeted over 1,500 times within the space of a few hours. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, says consumers are becoming much more savvy and expect organisations to relate to them as real life human beings and not simply transactions any more. "One of the key things that we're seeing in the changing world we're all living in is that we want to have better dialogue, not just monologue, with our organisations," says Ms Causon. According to a poll of 2,000 people by the communications agency Fishburn Hedges and Echo Research in April 2012, 36% of people had used a social media platform to contact a big company and 65% said it was a better way than call centres to get in touch with companies. It was not just confined to the young either, with 27% of people aged over 55 having used social media to complain. Ms Causon expects complaints via Twitter to only increase in popularity with the growth of social media. "A lot of us at the moment are not complaining necessarily through Twitter, but as we progress, it certainly is a medium of choice, and organisations will need to be able to respond appropriately," says Ms Causon. With almost 15,000 complaints a day about financial services in 2013, according to complaints data from the Financial Conduct Authority, Hannah Moore from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme monitored the Twitter feeds of eight of the major banks for a working day and found problems were not necessarily resolved on Twitter, but it did help push requests to the front of the queue. "When customers complained about hanging on premium rate phonelines, [some] staff promised to call them instead, and if you're confused about which department you need to get in touch with, Twitter's really helpful," she says. "The best banks provided the correct phone numbers, forms and web links within minutes - again saving you time on an 0845 number." According to Ms Causon it's important for the consumer to be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint too. "A banking problem in itself doesn't necessarily lend itself to a very public place like Twitter, so I think it's about the nature of the problem and what you're looking to have resolved." If Twitter is making it easier to complain, it also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies too, so there is no danger we will turn into a nation of whingers. Listen to the full report on Money Box on BBC Radio 4. Or catch up on BBC iPlayer.	There was a time when a strongly worded letter was the only means of having your complaint heard by a company, but is tweeting now the best way to get your gripe to the front of the queue?
Seven years ago, Matthew O'Donnell was convicted of killing 30-year-old Noel Williamson in Caledon in October 2004. Mr O'Donnell's lawyer's argued that the trial judge had misdirected the jury and erred by not allowing evidence of a clinical psychologist to be submitted. The ECHR rejected the appeal and he will serve the rest of his sentence. Mr O'Donnell, originally from County Kerry in the Republic of Ireland, is serving a life sentence at Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland. In 2008, the trial judge said that Mr O'Donnell would serve at least 12 years imprisonment, a reduction from the usual starting point of 15 years, to take account of his "limited intellectual capacity". Mr O'Donnell's IQ places him amongst the bottom 1% of the population and his understanding of spoken English is equivalent to that of a six-year-old child. Mr Williamson, from Killylea, County Armagh, was stabbed five times in the right lower face and neck and also suffered "multiple blows of considerable force" to his head, neck and shoulders, caused by kicking or stamping. Mr Williamson's badly beaten body was found by a man out walking his dog beside the River Blackwater. A clinical psychologist made an assessment of Mr O'Donnell by watching videotaped interviews that Irish police conducted with him at trial. Mr O'Donnell's lawyers argued at the ECHR that the clinical psychologist should have been allowed to share his conclusions with the court. They also argued that no inference should have been drawn from the fact that he chose not to testify at his trial. However, the appeals were dismissed. Mr O'Donnell was the second man to be convicted of the killing. In 2007, 20-year-old Samuel Houston from Churchill Cottages in Caledon was jailed for eight years for the manslaughter of Mr Williamson.	The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has found that a man with severe learning difficulties convicted of a County Tyrone murder had a fair trial.
Malorie Bantala, 21, was eight months pregnant when she was attacked by two men in Talfourd Place, Peckham, in south-east London, in June. A 20-year-old man has been charged with child destruction and grievous bodily harm with intent. But officers have yet to identify the second suspect. Det Insp David Suddick said: "The victim has recovered physically from her ordeal, but naturally remains devastated at the loss of her baby. "Somewhere out there is a very violent individual and we hope the offer of this reward may encourage someone to come forward." He added that the victim's white iPhone 5s went missing during the attack and is yet to be traced. Ms Bantala's former boyfriend, Kevin Wilson, of Longfield Estate, Bermondsey, south-east London, is due to face trial in November.	A £20,000 reward is being offered to find a "very violent" man involved in an attack which resulted in a heavily pregnant woman losing her baby.
Phyllida Lloyd will direct revivals of Julius Caesar and Henry IV and a new production of The Tempest, which are all set in a women's prison. Harriet Walter will play Brutus in Julius Caesar, King Henry in Henry IV, and Prospero in The Tempest. The new in-the-round venue will be open for 13 weeks from 23 September. Julius Caesar and Henry IV were both staged by the company at the Donmar's Covent Garden base in 2012 and 2014 respectively. The theatre hopes to make 25% of all tickets will be free to 25s and under with a new scheme called Young and Free, funded mainly through sponsorship and philanthropy. Artistic Director Josie Rourke said: "I remember very clearly the furore created by the idea of an all-female Shakespeare, when Phyllida Lloyd first staged Julius Caesar with Harriet Walter in 2012. "Phyllida Lloyd's work with this diverse, all-female company has been genuinely ground-breaking and in the intervening four years, theatre has got into the fast lane of debate and change. "It's time, with these Young and Free tickets, to join together our question about who gets to play these roles with a renewed mission for who gets to experience them." After its month-long run at the new London venue, The Tempest will transfer to Broadway in October as part of the Donmar's New York season, which runs from July until February 2017. The James Graham play Privacy, starring Daniel Radcliffe, and Christopher Hampton's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, will also be staged in New York.	London's Donmar Warehouse is to open a temporary theatre in King's Cross to host the company's all-female Shakespeare trilogy.
Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, along with a fourth man Germaine Lindsay, detonated bombs in London killing 52 people in 2005. Qari Asim, of the Leeds Makkah Mosque, said their families were still in "this sense of shock and disbelief". He said an event retracing their steps would take place over the weekend. Mr Asim, whose mosque is in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, said: "Ten years on and the Muslim community, and the wider community, we are all still looking for answers, we are all still trying to find out what are the factors and what is the evidence that leads to radicalisation. "The families of those three men who came from Leeds and blew themselves up in London, they are still looking for answers because to them they would never have imagined that their young men would do something like that and they're still going through this sense of shock and disbelief." He said the three were described as "ordinary young men, they were gentlemen, they were good to talk to, they were very friendly people effectively", he said. "How can three young men, living their ordinary lives, become so radicalised? Can be so motivated that they can take their own lives but also take the lives of others?" This weekend a group of young people from different faiths are to travel from Leeds to London retracing the steps of the three bombers. The Leeds Peace Ambassadors will undertake a "peace journey" to mark the 10th anniversary of the bombings, hoping to inspire unity among different faiths. Fifty-two people died and hundreds were injured when bombs exploded on three Tubes and a bus. Thirteen victims were killed on the bus at Tavistock Square, 26 died in a bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line; six died in an explosion at Edgware Road on the Circle Line; and seven died at Aldgate on the Circle Line.	The families of three 7 July suicide bombers are still looking for answers 10 years on, an imam from their home city of Leeds has said.
The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one. Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem. They broke a rule saying: "The driver must drive the car alone and unaided." Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision. The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track. Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a "critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal". Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem. But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear. Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: "Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear." Rosberg then asked: "What does that mean, I have to shift through it? Engineer: "Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it." Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance. Horner said: "The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules. "The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running. "It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing. "The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question." Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap. Wolff said: "We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time." However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

Carl McHugh was red-carded for a lunge on Don Cowie early in the second half. Hearts went ahead when Alexandros Tziolis' shot took a deflection off Keith Lasley and looped over goalkeeper Craig Samson. And Esmael Goncalves struck twice late on, the striker scoring his first goals for the Tynecastle club. Goncalves had an early low shot just wide before Louis Moult's header hit the bar, but the flag was up - wrongly - for offside against the Motherwell striker. The hosts had started the match with a back three in an attempt to stymie the Hearts attack, but as the half wore on the away side became more dangerous. First, a great run from left-back Lennard Sowah forced a save from Samson. Media playback is not supported on this device Then Jamie Walker threatened with a couple of fierce efforts which were just off target. He perhaps should have had a penalty when it looked like he had his shirt pulled in the box. Malaury Martin then stung the palms of Samson with a free-kick from 25 yards, but Motherwell would finish the half strongly. From a corner Lionel Ainsworth fired in a shot which was cleared off the line by Anastasios Avlonitis. McHugh then fired an effort over the bar. Moult was wrongly awarded awarded a free-kick at the edge of the box, having actually been tripped by team-mate Ainsworth. Referee Andrew Dallas even mistakenly booked Hearts midfielder Martin. Moult took the free-kick himself and the ball flew narrowly wide of Jack Hamilton's goal. Red cards defined Motherwell's match with Rangers last weekend and another sending off played a massive part in this match. This time it was McHugh who lunged in, catching Cowie painfully. There were echoes of Scott McDonald's red card tackle on Rangers' Kenny Miller, and it looked like the right decision by Dallas. Just minutes later Hearts opened the scoring. The impressive Greece international midfielder Tziolis fired in a shot from 20 yards which took a massive deflection off Lasley and beat Samson. But Lasley almost levelled moments later, his effort narrowly off target. Goncalves has shed 8kg and with his improved conditioning and professionalism it's intriguing to ponder what he can do for this Hearts side. The management at the club clearly believe in the talents of this mercurial player, and that belief will give Goncalves added confidence. He looked determined to get his first Hearts goal and caused Motherwell problems all afternoon. It finally came as he fired home with a composed finish. It clearly meant a lot to him as he celebrated with the travelling fans - for which he was duly booked. Goncalves restrained himself from a second yellow after he scored again as Hearts made it two wins in four days following Wednesday's 4-1 defeat of Rangers.

John Boreland, a leading member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a paramilitary group, was shot dead outside his home on Sunday night. Police have called for calm and say they will increase patrols in the area. Tensions among loyalist paramilitaries and criminality are among a number of lines of inquiry, police said. But their early assessment is that this was not a sectarian murder. The 46-year-old father-of-three was shot outside his flat in Sunningdale Gardens as he returned home just before 21:50 BST. "He had just got out of his car when he was shot at close range a number of times," said the detective leading the investigation, Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway. "His injuries were such that he died at the scene." Police believe a shotgun was used. "John Boreland was known to police," said Mr Galloway. "He had survived a previous attempt on his life in 2014 and had been warned by police about his safety within the past few months." The victim was being mourned by his two sons and his daughter, his fiancÃ©e, his sister and his mother and father, said Mr Galloway. "I have visited the family today and I am sure you will understand that they are completely devastated," he added. He appealed to the public for help in compiling information about the last 24 hours of Mr Boreland's life. He also asked for anyone who witnessed vehicles leaving the scene of the shooting - including a motorbike, a silver Renault Megan car and a black Peugeot 307 car - to contact police. North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds said the murder had "sent shockwaves throughout North Belfast and have cast a dark shadow over the local area". Mr Dodds, who led a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) delegation who met police to discuss the attack, welcomed the announcement that more police will be deployed in the area. "We are committed to ensuring they have every resource necessary at their disposal during the investigation," said the DUP MP. "We reiterate our calls to those who may have any information surrounding the events of last night to bring it forward to the PSNI as a matter of urgency."	A prominent loyalist who was murdered in north Belfast had been warned by police about his safety within the past few months, officers have confirmed.
The Breakthrough Listen project, backed by Prof Stephen Hawking, will train a US radio telescope on a target called Tabby's Star. Tabby's Star has been a subject of attention and controversy over its irregular dimming pattern. Some scientists have been puzzled by large dips in the star's brightness. Hawking backs new search for aliens One of the most favoured explanations for this behaviour is that a swarm of comet fragments is periodically blocking light from the star, which also known by its official designation - KIC 8462852. One very remote and speculative idea - yet one that has attracted much attention in the media - is that the pattern is caused by some kind of artificial structure, or a collection of structures, around the star. The co-director of the Breakthrough Listen programme, Dr Andrew Siemion, said he was sceptical of explanations that involved intelligent life. He added: "The Breakthrough Listen programme has the most powerful SETI equipment on the planet, and access to the largest telescopes on the planet. "We can look at it with greater sensitivity and for a wider range of signal types than any other experiment in the world." The team plans to use the 100m Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, US, to observe the star, which is named after the leader of the team that discovered it - Tabetha Boyajian, assistant professor at Louisiana State University. Previous searches, using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory, have failed to find any unusual signals around the star. But Dr Siemion explained: "The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it's the largest, most sensitive telescope that's capable of looking at Tabby's star given its position in the sky." The unusual behaviour around Tabby's star was first reported in September 2015 by Dr Boyajian, who was then a postdoctoral student at Yale University. The findings were published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The team was actually looking for evidence of planets orbiting stars other than our own. While most such dimming by transiting planets is brief, regular and blocks just 1 or 2% of the light of the star, Tabby's star dims for days at a time, by as much as 22%, and at irregular intervals. Speculation that the phenomenon could be caused by a "megastructure" built by an intelligent civilisation, has been dismissed by most scientists. But it has propelled the stellar object to prominence in the popular media. "I don't think it's very likely - a one in a billion chance or something like that - but nevertheless, we're going to check it out," said Dan Werthimer, chief scientist at Berkeley SETI, based at the University of California, Berkeley. Yet Tabby's Star remains a fascinating conundrum for astronomers. Some observations show that the dips in brightness are more irregular than a comet swarm would produce. And another study suggested that it had been dimming at a steady rate for the past century. The Breakthrough Listen initiative was launched in 2015 at an event in London. It is largely funded by Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner - who also supports the Breakthrough Prizes for science and maths.	A $100m initiative to listen for signals from alien life is targeting a star with an unusual dimming pattern.
United Utilities has been working at the Mancunian Way site over the weekend to assess the collapse. A repair plan is "now in place" to stabilise the hole and make it watertight so engineers can repair the damage. The road will remain closed in both directions while work takes place. A spokesman for Manchester City Council said: "This initial phase of work could take up to 10 days, but until we are completely satisfied that the area is safe the section of the Mancunian Way will remain closed in both directions." A diversion remains in place via London Road, Fairfield Street, A665, Hyde Road and Downing Street. At the weekend, members of the public were warned not to cross a safety cordon as engineering work was being "hindered". About two weeks' worth of rain fell in about six hours in Manchester on Friday before the hole appeared. Tony Griffiths, of United Utilities, told the BBC: "An awful lot of rain fell on Friday - a few days' worth - which washed the ground material beneath the carriageway, causing the highway culvert to fail. Debris washed into the sewer, causing a domino effect leading to the collapse." Mr Griffiths said the hole is still "quite unstable" and needs to be filled in before work can be carried out.	A busy Manchester road which partly collapsed when a sinkhole appeared is to remain closed for at least 10 days.
President Donald Trump has questioned the neutrality of Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate Russian interference in the US election. He has also blamed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for Mr Mueller's probe. Mr Graham warned Mr Trump that firing Mr Mueller "would be the beginning of the end" of his presidency. "Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong," Mr Graham told reporters on Thursday. The Trump administration has sought to discredit Mr Mueller over his friendship with former FBI chief James Comey, who had been heading the inquiry until he was sacked by Mr Trump in May. The president has also suggested Mr Mueller's team of lawyers could be biased as some had made campaign contributions to Democrats. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington There's no telling if Lindsey Graham's legislation insulating the independent counsel Robert Mueller from Donald Trump's wrath will go anywhere. The South Carolina Republican has been known to occasionally wander from the Senate flock. Still, this could be the first glimmers of bipartisan congressional efforts to construct a restraining barrier around the Trump presidency. Already it appears likely a bill preventing Donald Trump from unilaterally loosening current Russia sanctions will wind up on the president's desk. Despite the administration's objections that this infringes on executive foreign policy prerogatives, hardly any members of Congress have voted against the legislation. Now, amid concerns that Mr Trump may fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a way of getting at Mr Mueller, another set of handcuffs could be applied. The White House appears to be girding for war against those investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign. Chances are this more aggressive posture, including a presidential feud with Mr Sessions - who served in the US Senate for 20 years - will only make matters worse, however. Like a person trapped in quicksand, the more the president struggles, the deeper he sinks. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a "witch hunt". The South Carolina Republican announced he was creating a measure aimed at protecting Mr Mueller by mandating that any special counsel appointed to investigate a president or his staff could not be fired "unless you have judicial review of the firing". He added that Mr Trump was crossing a "red line" in his consideration to axe Mr Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to lead the probe after Mr Comey was fired. Mr Graham's warning comes as the president has repeatedly attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose a meeting with the Kremlin's envoy during his confirmation hearing. Mr Sessions, known for his hardline anti-immigration stance, was one of then-candidate Mr Trump's earliest supporters in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he was "disappointed" with Mr Sessions, tweeting that he had "taken a VERY weak position" on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In an interview with the New York Times, the president expressed regret about appointing Mr Sessions, adding he "should have never recused himself". Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new communications director, fuelled the fire on Tuesday by suggesting the attorney general's days could be numbered. Mr Graham on Wednesday said "there will be holy hell to pay" if Mr Sessions is fired, warning that there would be "no confirmation for a new attorney general in 2017". "This is not just a diversion, this is unnerving," he told reporters. "It's unfair to Jeff Sessions, he's a good man who deserves better, and some of the suggestions the president is making go way beyond what's acceptable."	US Senator Lindsey Graham has said he is drafting legislation to stop any attempt by the Trump administration to fire Russia investigator Bob Mueller.
Mr Mortazavi, considered a close aide of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was taken to Tehran's Evin prison, the semi-official Fars agency reported. Until January, he was head of Iran's wealthy social welfare organisation but was removed under pressure from the Majlis - Iran's parliament. Mr Mortazavi, 45, was placed under US sanctions in 2010. He and other officials were accused by Washington of "sustained and severe violations of human rights". By Mohammad ManzarpourBBC Persian Saeed Mortazavi's arrest could be considered a turning point in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's tenure as Iran's Supreme Leader. Having risen from obscurity as a young judge, Mr Mortazavi was instrumental in the mass culling of reformist newspapers during former President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He later gained further notoriety for his involvement in the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist who died in custody following her arrest in 2003. More recently, Mr Mortazavi was accused in connection with the abuse and killing of post-election protesters in the Kahrizak detention centre. It is unlikely that Mr Mortazavi's arrest could have come without the supreme leader's approval. Whatever red-line Mr Mortazavi may have crossed to trigger this chain of events, his arrest marks the end of an era of impunity, long enjoyed by the Islamic state's most loyal enforcers. Analysts say his arrest could be the result of disputes between President Ahmadinejad on one hand and parliament and the judiciary on the other. The arrest was "possibly" in connection with allegations of torture and the deaths of prisoners after the controversial 2009 election, Fars reported. A few days after he was removed last month as head of the social welfare fund, he was rehired by President Ahmadinejad, but this time as official caretaker of the same organisation, angering some lawmakers. While defending the former prosecutor in parliament, Mr Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament and the head of the judiciary of corruption, which analysts say might be one of the reasons behind Mr Mortazavi's arrest. Mr Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election in 2009 - and the violent suppression of subsequent opposition protests - has widened the rift between conservatives and reformists within Iran's political establishment. Correspondents say parliament has been hostile to Mr Ahmadinejad for most of his second four-year term which expires in August. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani is a likely frontrunner in the race to succeed Mr Ahmadinejad.	Iranian police have arrested former Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi, Iranian news agencies say.
And the world of Formula 1 is no different - some drivers have consistently excelled while others have had a campaign to forget. A record 21-race season gives us plenty to reflect on as the year draws to a close, so we want you to tell us your top three heroes and villains from the past nine months. Hamilton in Monaco? Rosberg in Singapore? Verstappen, um, everywhere? You decide... We've asked BBC F1 experts to give us their three best and three, well, most disappointing drivers of 2016. We will reveal their views, alongside the collective results of what you all thought, later. Who were the best during 2016? Who were the biggest underachievers during 2016?	It's safe to say 2016 been a truly memorable year for a whole host of reasons - some very good, some utterly awful.
Evacuation advice has been issued to Kennett River, Grey River and Wongarra. Most residents have left their homes. But a wind change on Thursday afternoon eased the threat to these communities, fire authorities said. Firefighters and aircraft from NSW and New Zealand are on standby in case the fire breaks containment lines. The fire is the same one that destroyed more than 100 homes at Wye River and Separation Creek over Christmas Day. It now covers around 2,800 hectares (7,000 acres) and is likely to pose a threat to communities along the famous Great Ocean Road for months. In South Australia a fire is threatening homes at Mosquito Hill south of Adelaide. Aircraft have been sent to the area but the fire is burning very fiercely, South Australia Country Fire Service spokesman Brenton Eden told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Mr Eden said residents in the area should execute their emergency plans.	More than 500 firefighters are set to battle a blaze in the Australian state of Victoria, one of the world's most fire-prone regions on New Year's Eve.
People are twice as likely to survive for at least a decade after being diagnosed than they were at the start of the 1970s, the charity said. It said better treatments and speedier diagnoses are among the reasons. But cancer can leave a legacy of side effects such as depression and financial difficulties, it also warned. The report, called Cancer Then and Now, estimates around a quarter of survivors will have long-term issues that need support. Helen Taskiran told BBC News she suffered from depression as a result of surviving cancer, and has even missed out on job opportunities because of it. She was first diagnosed in 1991 with bowel cancer, which she survived, but since then has been diagnosed with four other cancers, including breast, skin and womb. "They've left me with swollen arms and legs, tiredness, sometimes depression, [making me] dubious about going for other jobs," said Helen, whose son was just three years old when she was first diagnosed. "Your self-esteem goes down, you're wondering whether people will judge you. "I've had job interviews where people have turned me down because I've had cancer - so that all adds to the depression. I've been offered jobs and then when I've filled in medical forms all of a sudden the job has disappeared before it's even started," she added. A total of 625,000 people in the UK are currently suffering with depression after cancer treatment, Macmillan Cancer Support said. Greig Trout survived cancer at the age of seven, and again at 30, but he says the worst part of his battle was after his second all-clear. He says he became "gripped by anxiety, and the fear of cancer coming back, or the fear that maybe it hadn't gone". "I felt guilty, angry at myself," says Mr Trout, now 37 and from Thames Ditton in south-west London. "At times I was thinking 'am I ungrateful for feeling this way after having survived when so many others don't?'." Read more about his story Prof Jane Maher, chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "We now see fewer of the big side-effects, such as an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, we saw after treatment in the 1970s and 80s. "But some of the effects doctors consider 'small', such as fatigue and poor bowel control, can have a profound impact on someone's quality of life. "Sadly there is no cancer treatment available at the moment that does not carry a risk of side-effects." The charity said although a growing number of people are surviving long-term with cancer, more needed to be done to make sure they got the right care. The organisation says it has evolved from being a handful of nurses providing end-of-life care in the 1970s to a much bigger network that even includes benefits advisers. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the fact more people were surviving cancer was "excellent news" and credited the work of NHS staff carrying out diagnosis, treatment and care to help patients. "To help, we announced last year that by 2020 people diagnosed with cancer in England will benefit from an individually tailored recovery package," he said. Meanwhile the Welsh government said it welcomed the improvements, but a spokeswoman said "the numbers of people experiencing cancer in their lifetime are increasing and this is set against a backdrop of increasing pressures on NHS resources". Nell Barrie, of Cancer Research UK, also stressed it was important to continue focusing on "world-leading science to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment, especially for the harder-to-treat cancers like lung, brain and pancreatic cancer".	More than 170,000 people in the UK who were diagnosed with cancer up to 40 years ago are still alive, a report by Macmillan Cancer Support has suggested.
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said forces had mainly "done well" with 20% cuts in four years and more savings were likely. Sir Thomas said a "smaller service" would have to "work smarter". In December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts. But speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: "Austerity is here to stay. "The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year. "There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically - but so have the demands made on the police." Asked if there was room for further cuts, Sir Thomas said: "In some respects there are further efficiencies to be obtained, that is undoubtedly the case. "They [police forces] need to work smarter because they will be working smaller." Sir Thomas said forces had not done enough work to analyse new demands being made on them, particularly with regards to cyber crime. He also said that while any crime reported to the police had to be taken seriously, there were some crimes that were "more serious than others". "Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people, that do greatest harms to communities - serious and organised crime, drugs, violent offences, the grooming and sexual exploitation of children," he said. Last month, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that unless police "act fast" and with "courage" to implement far-reaching reforms, the cuts would endanger public safety. He suggested police forces in England and Wales should merge and share resources with other emergency services. Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers' president, has also recently warned that police forces were struggling to deal with reductions in funding.	Police cuts in England and Wales are "here to stay", the head of the police watchdog has said.
The city is being divided into four areas, each being serviced on a separate day with no collections on a Monday. The changes will save up to Â£500,000 a year with the bin lorry fleet reduced by five to 21, the council said. No staff will be lost as fewer agency staff will be hired. Households have been sent information packs about the changes to the collections. Residents have been asked to check their packs to find out their new bin day and which bin is due to be emptied. Councillor Chris Poulter said: "Anyone not yet sure of the day or which bins to put out, should check their information pack, which gives full details, or they can check on the website by simply inputting their post code." Four out of five households will see their collection day change. The city crews collect about 114,000 bins every week.	Derby City Council are changing bin collection days and times from 6 June.
Officers were called to a property in Fore Street, Chudleigh, on Monday evening. The injured 20-year-old, who was taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital after the assault, has since been discharged. Devon and Cornwall Police said a 25-year-old man has been arrested and believe the assault was an "isolated incident".	A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another man was found with stab wounds in a Devon town.
Reports in Australia say that it could knock as much as Â£200m (A$425m) off its value. The parent company of the bank plans to float the Glasgow-based lender in Australia later this year. Chancellor George Osborne announced he was phasing out the bank levy. He also announced plans to introduce an 8% surcharge on bank profits, in addition to corporation tax. That knocked share prices of smaller UK banks which are already traded. A bank analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia calculated that would knock A$425m off its valuation, and suggested that could push National Australia Bank (NAB) to sell off a larger stake in order to meet its target for raising capital. A spokesman for the NAB was reported by the Melbourne Herald Sun saying the move would have no impact on the parent bank's earnings. A spokesman in Glasgow for Clydesdale Bank, which includes the Yorkshire Bank brand, declined to comment. Clydesdale Bank is seen at the Melbourne headquarters and in the Australian media as a drag on NAB, having amassed a large portfolio of bad property loans, and the high costs of redress for mis-selling financial products. The new NAB chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, has made it a priority to split Clydesdale, handing up to 80% of it to NAB investors and selling the remainder on London and Australian exchanges. Earlier this week, senior staff at NAB in Melbourne set out the case for investing in the spun-off UK bank, to institutional investors in Australia. They portrayed it as one of the so-called challenger banks which is best placed to take on the British market's 'big five'.	The surcharge tax on bank profits announced in the Budget is being seen as another blow for the sale of Clydesdale Bank.
The Warriors have won three Super League games in a row and sit just two points behind leaders Hull FC. "I think we're off it at the moment, I don't think we're anywhere near our potential," Wane, 51, told BBC Radio Manchester. "I was asked a few weeks ago and I said we're four or five out of 10 and I still think the same." He added: "I don't mean to say that in an arrogant way, I genuinely believe that. I know what the players are capable of." Wigan winger Josh Charnley has impressed during their recent run, including a hat-trick in Friday's win at Salford. He has now scored 15 tries in 17 outings in what is his final season with the club before a cross-code switch to Sale Sharks. "I think he's been great," added Wane. "I do think his performances have improved and that shows you the mental strength of Josh Charnley. "He'll be sorely missed by us, but he wants to go out of this season with a bang and the way he's playing at the moment, he's been outstanding. "He has my mentality that we want to win things every single year, and he's playing that way."	Wigan head coach Shaun Wane believes there is much more to come from his squad in the second half of the season.
In a video released hours ahead of his official launch in Miami, the 62-year-old brother of ex-president George W Bush declared: "I'm ready to lead." He also promised to protect the country's most vulnerable and remove the barriers to social mobility. But doubts persist among conservatives in his party. And early polling suggests that he has yet to dominate a wide field of Republican candidates. In his latest video, entitled The Greatest Century, he strikes a very optimistic note, saying: "I see a great country on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead." The Bush team may have hoped their man would have built a clear lead in the polls by now, but the consensus view is he's currently just one in a pack of frontrunners. Recent interviews with campaign strategists indicate that they are going to start using the millions of dollars at their disposal to target opponents they consider most threatening - namely, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. In his opening campaign video, Mr Bush emphasised his positive, optimistic vision for the future, saying some politicians "talk about problems; I see solutions". But in the coming months, the fight for the Republican presidential nomination could get nasty. Although his campaign becomes official on Monday, it's been no secret for many months and his team is well on the way to raising a $100m war chest. During a tour of Europe last week, Mr Bush warned he would not waver from his core beliefs, even if some are unpopular in his party. "I'm not going to change who I am," he said. "I respect people who may not agree with me, but I'm not going to change my views because today someone has a view that's different." In a separate video, called Making A Difference, he champions the rights of women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. "My core beliefs start with the premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back,'' he says. "What we need is new leadership that takes conservative principles and applies them so that people can rise up." Profile: Jeb Bush A Spanish language video was also released, demonstrating his strong Hispanic links - his wife Columba is Mexican and he speaks Spanish well. But in recent weeks he has found himself on the defensive over the Iraq War - led by his older brother, President George W Bush - as he stumbled to clarify his position. The issue brought into focus the problems he may face over his famous surname and the baggage that comes with it. He becomes the 11th Republican to declare, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio among his biggest rivals. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the clear frontrunner. This raises the possibility in 2016 of another Clinton-Bush race like that of 1992, when Mrs Clinton's husband Bill beat Jeb Bush's father, President George HW Bush. US 2016: Meet the possible candidates	Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has pledged to fix America as he launches his bid to become the Republican nominee for president.
And do not take my word for it, jockey Ruby Walsh, looking for his sixth win after five on the great Kauto Star, has two words to describe jump racing's William Hill-sponsored mid-season championship: "Bloody competitive." Walsh's mount Champagne Fever, trained in Ireland by Willie Mullins, has lack of steeple chasing experience and stamina for the three-mile distance to prove, with the former a more likely stumbling block. He is ranked second favourite behind last year's winner Silviniaco Conti, who, with Al Ferof, attempts to add to champion trainer Paul Nicholls' record haul of eight King George victories, five of them also with Kauto Star. Both horses turn up in apparently very good form, 'Silviniaco', after a November success at Haydock over fellow Kempton big-race challengers Menorah, Dynaste and Cue Card. Al Ferof, last year's third, who prefers the going on the drier side, made a superb return from an absence at Ascot, also in November, and given his conditions can be expected to play a major role. Menorah, a stellar mount for Tom O'Brien in place of the suspended Richard Johnson, has been magnificent this season with a good win at Wetherby followed by that gallant second behind Silviniaco Conti. There is no doubting he will put in another sterling performance, but there are doubts about whether he is likely to be quite good enough. Things have not worked out well so far for Cue Card, runner-up in the 2013 King George, with fourth places at Exeter and then at Haydock. Jockey Daryl Jacob, however, believes the eight-year-old, trained by Colin Tizzard and by his son Joe, the horse's now-retired ex-rider, will put in a better show especially as the Tizzard horses are going very well. My fancy though is for Dynaste, trained by David Pipe with, I imagine, this race very much in mind. The shrewd Pipe team will have been very satisfied with the encouraging nature of the already-mentioned Haydock third place by the grey, last year's fifth, and first or second at both of the last two Cheltenham and Aintree Festivals. Although also the winner of the 2012 Feltham Novices Chase - now the Kauto Star Chase - in heavy conditions, if the rain stayed away, as forecast, that would not do him any harm. And chatting to Dynaste's jockey Tom Scudamore did not put me off. He said: "He's one of the best chasers in the country. "You think of the likes of Dynaste, Cue Card, Silviniaco Conti, the main English guns as it were, they are all capable of beating each other, and none of their levels of form is much higher than the rest. "As boring as it sounds, it's just a case of who's better on the day. "You've got the Irish horse Champagne Fever as well, and he's very good. He's been doing a lot of his racing over two miles, so the hustle and bustle and speed of the race shouldn't affect him. "He should stay ok, but you can't be 100% sure until he's done it. "My horse ran well at Haydock and is hopefully in good form, and we're looking forward to going there with a chance of coming home with the trophy." My 1-2-3: Dynaste - Al Ferof - Champagne Fever.	It looks like as wide-open a staging of jump racing's King George VI Chase as there has been for a bit, one of those occasions when you could go into the pub, tip one of five or six and not look ridiculous.
Nicola Collingbourne was found at her home in Ivel Court on the Jackman's Estate in Letchworth on Tuesday. Yvonne Caylor, 52, of Grove Road in Hitchin, will appear before Hatfield Remand Court on Monday. Hertfordshire Police said officers want to speak to anyone who saw a person "of large build wearing a high-vis jacket" near the flat on Monday morning.	A woman has been charged with murder after a 26-year-old was found dead at a flat in Hertfordshire.
The Briton, 31, who begins his title defence at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday, posted videos on Snapchat of him travelling on a motorway. It is illegal to use phones whilst driving in New Zealand. Police reviewed the incident but will not be taking further action after citing a lack of "sufficient evidence". "Auckland City Police will be taking no further action in relation to recent media publicity about Lewis Hamilton and his motorcycle journey in Auckland," a police spokesperson said. "The video footage available does not provide us with sufficient enough evidence that an offence has occurred." It is not the first time three-time world champion Hamilton has been involved in driving incidents. The Briton was fined around £300 after performing car stunts for fans outside Melbourne's motor racing circuit, before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix. He also had his driving licence suspended for a month in France in 2007 for speeding on a motorway. And in November, Hamilton crashed his £1.6m super car in Monaco because "heavy partying" had left him tired.	Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton has been investigated by police after appearing to take a selfie while riding a motorbike in New Zealand.
Arturo Vidal scored Bayern's first when he drilled home after his initial shot had been blocked. Germany striker Thomas Muller then turned in from close range as defender Mats Hummels nodded down from a corner. Forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and recent signing Ousmane Dembele went close for Dortmund. "It was difficult and Dortmund played very, very well," said Ancelotti, who took over from Manchester City-bound Pep Guardiola in the summer and has won his 18th title as a coach. "But things worked much better for us after the break and this gives us some self-confidence for the Bundesliga. "This team is already very, very strong." The Bundesliga season starts on Friday, 26 August, when Bayern begin their title defence against Werder Bremen.	Carlo Ancelotti gained his first trophy as Bayern Munich coach thanks to their 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup.
Social media users tweeted #FireCobert in a demand for the TV host to be sacked for a "homophobic" slur made on his CBS programme The Late Show on Monday in reference to relations between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Speaking on The Late Show on Wednesday, Mr Colbert said that he would change "some of the words" in the monologue but did not regret it. Not everyone has accepted the olive branch however. In his anti-Trump rant on Monday, Mr Colbert jokingly referred to sexual relations between President Trump and President Putin, using a phrase that is considered by some people as offensive. One Trump supporter who took part in #GaysForTrump, tweeted on Wednesday that Colbert's original rant was "homophobic" and "disgusting", while many others called for him to be fired. Some defended him, saying people who criticised Colbert for offensive speech while simultaneously attacking political correctness were hypocritical. Stephen Colbert lambasted for 'homophobic attack' on Trump On Wednesday, Colbert addressed the backlash. After checking he still had a job, asking: "Am I still the host?", Mr Colbert justified his monologue: "I was a little upset with Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine, so... I had a few choice insults for the president in return. I don't regret that". To rapturous applause, the host quipped: "I believe he can take care of himself. I have jokes, he has the launch codes - it's a fair fight." However, Mr Colbert then backtracked, explaining that while he would "do it again", he would change some of the words used in the monologue. Admitting that some of his words had been unnecessarily "crude", he offered an olive branch to the LGBT community, saying: "Anyone who expresses their love for another person in their own way is, to me, an American hero." Many Trump supporters continued to find fault with the comedian and did not appear to be satisfied with Colbert's statement. "Stephen Colbert's rant against Trump was a disgrace," tweeted Joseph Winters on Thursday morning. But others continued to question the commitment of anti-Colbert tweets to the cause of LGBT rights: "It's really rich that the people who are calling Colbert a homophobe are the Trump voters who are actively working against gay rights," tweeted Tammie Willis. Written by the UGC and Social News team	US comedian Stephen Colbert has said he has no regrets but that with hindsight he "would change a few words" in his viral monologue that attracted accusations of homophobia this week.
Carol Black has quit the party exactly nine years after the UUP hailed her election to Banbridge Council as a "St Valentine's Day massacre" for the DUP. She branded UUP leader Mike Nesbitt as "arrogant" and told the Belfast Telegraph: "I don't know if he is even a unionist." For his part, Mr Nesbitt told reporters he is "relaxed" about his party's reaction to his plans, and remains committed to unionists and nationalists working together. An unholy row in a rural church in County Fermanagh is the lead story in the Irish News. The paper says a number of people "walked out" of Sunday Mass in protest after a priest accused named individuals of bullying him from the altar. It quotes Fr John Halton apologising "unreservedly" for his outburst, and asking for forgiveness from his parishioners. The Irish News also carries a fresh appeal from the family of a man murdered by loyalist paramilitary gang in a Lisburn pub 30 years ago. Bin man Paul Bradley suffered a fractured skull when he was beaten with pool cues and a broken chair in the Tavern Bar in December 1986. His brother and sister tell the paper they hope witnesses who were too frightened to come forward at the time might feel "safer" about giving evidence now. Troubles legacy cases continue to feature prominently in all the local papers, with the Daily Mirror and others reporting High Court claims that former Prime Minister Edward Heath was "involved in the decision-making process surrounding the torture" of 14 men in Northern Ireland in 1971. The 14 internees, who are known as the Hooded Men, want a a full inquiry into state involvement in the interrogation techniques used against them. The Belfast Telegraph gets Alex Best's verdict on a new documentary on her late ex-husband. The 45-year-old also dismisses claims that she ever suggested "supernatural" goings on in her 200-year-old cottage could be the ghost of George Best. The Mirror features a very unusual Valentine's Day present that came as a complete surprise to one Belfast wife. Murals of masked men are nothing new in Northern Ireland, but this one is in the shape of Holywood star Jamie Dornan, in his Fifty Shades Darker pose. The paper says it has "appeared overnight" on a shop front in Belfast's North Street.	The resignation of an Ulster Unionist Party councillor, in protest at her leader's plan to transfer his second preference vote to the SDLP, makes the front page of both the Belfast Telegraph and the News Letter.
Unite union members based at plants in Cowley, Goodwood, near Chichester, Hams Hall in the West Midlands and Swindon, turned down the offer by 56.6%. Workers have already staged four walkouts during the dispute, which is over the closure of a final-salary pension scheme. BMW said the offer was "fair" and it was disappointed at the ballot result. Unite representatives will meet on Tuesday to discuss the next steps in the dispute, which has seen the first-ever strikes by the company's British employees. Three 24-hour strikes scheduled in May were suspended while workers considered the offer, which the union did not recommend to its members. Unite national officer Fred Hanna said: "It is clear that it did not go far enough or deal with the concerns many of our members have over BMW's pension plans. "We would urge BMW bosses to reflect on the result and listen to the workforce by further engaging in meaningful talks with Unite." A BMW spokesman said: "We are now considering the implications of the ballot result and we will be meeting with the union in due course to discuss next steps. "We believe the offer, which resulted from lengthy negotiations with the union since September last year, was fair. "It was designed to improve competitiveness, which is in the long-term interests of all our employees in the future."	Workers at car giant BMW have voted to reject an offer aimed at resolving a long-running dispute over pensions.

The image of Ken Farlow, 95, staring through a fence at Gloucestershire Airport came to the attention of bosses after it was shared by his daughter. They invited him to Royal Air Force Coningsby and the Royal International Air Tattoo after hearing his story. And on Saturday, he was treated to a flight in a two-man trainer aircraft. Gloucestershire Airport's Darren Lewington said: "The original story broke a week or so ago, but the icing on the cake on Saturday was that Ken got to take to the skies himself at our charity open day." The operations director said Mr Farlow - who has bowel cancer - flew in a two-seat Citabria aircraft with James Peplow, the owner of a specialist flying school based at the airport. "He also got to see his beloved Spitfire again," Mr Lewington added. "We're delighted we've been able to rekindle all those memories, and that the family have something positive to look back on when the inevitable time comes." Mr Farlow's daughter Helen Nock, who took the original photo of him, said: "I still can't believe he flew. And I'm still getting my head around that this has gone round the world from one simple photograph." She said her father, who lives in Painswick, Gloucestershire, was a chartered electrical engineer in the war and spent time in Syria and Palestine working on Spitfires and Hurricanes.	A terminally-ill former World War Two spitfire engineer has taken to the skies after a poignant photo of him became an unlikely internet hit.
The operation happened in north-west Mexico in recent days but few details have been released. Guzman, head of the Sinaloa cartel, escaped from a high-security prison in July through a specially dug tunnel. His escape was an embarrassment for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The government said in a statement that efforts to recapture Guzman had been focused in the north-west of the country, not far from Guzman's native Sinaloa state. "As a result of these actions, and to avoid his capture, in recent days, the fugitive engaged in a hasty retreat, which, according to the information received, caused him injuries to one leg and the face," the statement said. "It's important to clarify that these injuries were not a product of a direct clash," it added, without giving further details. The statement added: "The security cabinet continues to conduct all actions that will allow the recapture of this criminal." Mexico has arrested several prison officials since Guzman's escape. Investigators said he had inside help to flee through a tunnel that ran 1.5km from under a shower in his cell to outside the prison. After his escape, Guzman took to Twitter to taunt the police and insult President Pena Nieto. Guzman was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and spent nearly a decade in another maximum-security Mexican jail before escaping, reportedly in a laundry basket. He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014 after a series of high-profile arrests of associates and covert surveillance by the US authorities.	Fugitive Mexican drugs lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman suffered face and leg injuries as he narrowly evaded a police operation to recapture him, officials have confirmed.
Officials said Mr Guelleh won 87% of Friday's vote, which activists complained was preceded by political repression and curbs on basic freedoms. Mr Guelleh, in power since 1999, begins a fourth five-year term in power. He faced five rivals in the election, but three opposition parties boycotted the poll. The opposition complain of police brutality and media bias under Mr Guelleh's rule. "The people of Djibouti have again entrusted me with the state's highest office," Mr Guelleh, 68, said in a speech on national TV. More on this and other African news stories Djibouti election: What you need to know Djiboutiâ€™s thin-skinned democracy Djibouti's strategic position on the Gulf of Aden means that it is home to US and French military bases. The country is also seen as relatively stable in a region which includes Somalia, where the government does not control the whole country, and Yemen, where there is a civil war. Observers say this explains the muted criticism of President Guelleh from the West. Some 180,000 people were eligible to vote, around a fourth of the population. The opposition were angry that the president rescinded his earlier decision not to seek another term. His main rival, representing the opposition Union for National Salvation (USN) coalition, was Omar Elmi Kaireh, a Djibouti independence hero. He came second, with 7%, according to provisional results announced by Interior Minister Hassan Omar.	Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh has won a landslide victory in an election criticised by opposition parties and rights groups.
Heavy rain in Brisbane also led to the women's Test being postponed. The ladies' fixture will kick off at 05:00 BST, with the men's match taking place at 07:00 BST (16:00 local time). "There were a number of considerations for this decision, primarily player safety as well as supporters," NRL head of football Todd Greenberg said.	Australia and New Zealand will play their Anzac Test fixture at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday, after a waterlogged pitch forced a postponement on Friday.
Mageean's time of 2:00.79 cut 2.05 seconds off her previous best but she was passed in the closing 15 metres by England's Alex Bell who won in 2:00.53. The Portaferry woman had been tipped to challenge Rose-Anne Galligan's Irish record of 2:00.58. Pacemaker Sinead Denny went to the bell in 59.45 with Mageean just in arrears. When European Championship 400m semi-finalist Denny dropped out after 450 metres, it left Mageean with a two-metre lead but Bell, a quality athlete who just missed on Olympic qualification, stayed in touch before unleashing her late run to pass the Northern Irishwoman. Yorkshire athlete Bell's winning time cut 0.76 seconds off her previous personal best. After her first run on home soil since winning her European bronze medal two weeks ago, Mageean made no attempt to hide her frustration after being pipped by the 23-year-old. "I'm very disappointed. I had to do a lot of the work in that race and just got run down in the last few metres," said Mageean, who will head to the Ireland pre-Olympic training camp in Rio early next week. "I'll be back to win the 800m and the mile at the Morton Games in the future." There were American winners in both mile races with Katie Mackey setting a new women's meeting record of 4:25.48 and John Gregorek also improving his personal best as he pipped compatriot Kyle Merber to win the men's event in 3:55.57. The quality of the race was such that even 11th-placed Irishman Paul Robinson, back in action after a long injury spell, broke four minutes as he clocked 3:58.75. The men's 400m produced the tightest of finishes with Sudanese athlete Sadam Koumi given the verdict as he was given the same time as Guyana's Winston George. With Britain's Jared Dunn (46.28) in third, Brian Gregan finished fourth in 46.59 to edge out David Gillick (46.93) in the battle of the Irish athletes. There was a predictable American one-two in the men's 100m as US Olympic trials semi-finals Joe Morris (10.27) pipped Dentarius Locke (10.27) who finished eighth in the final in Eugene. With Amy Foster, like Jason Smyth, a late withdrawal from the meeting, Nigeria's Stephani Kalu won the women's 100m in 11.60 which left her ahead of Irish pair Niamh Whelan (11.72) and Joan Healy (11.73). Meanwhile, Mark English showed encouraging form as he battles for form after injury as he clocked a big season's best of 1:45.36 at the Diamond League meeting at London's Olympic Stadium. English, who only recently return to action after a stress fracture, was 1.48 seconds behind French winner Pierre-Ambroise Bosse but it was still a very encouraging run for the Donegal man ahead of the Olympics.	European medallist Ciara Mageean was left "disappointed" as she was edged out over 800m at the Morton Games despite setting a big personal best.
Media playback is not supported on this device Midfielder Stefano Mauri, 32, was held along with former Genoa midfielder Omar Milanetto, police said. Juventus coach Antonio Conte, who just led the club to the Serie A title in his first season in charge, is among those being questioned by police. Officers also visited Italy's pre-Euro 2012 training camp to question left-back Domenico Criscito, 25. Police are searching more than 30 homes, including those of players, trainers and administrators of clubs in Serie A, Serie B and lower divisions. For many months now this investigation into match-fixing in the Italian game has been widening and deepening. While up to now much of the suspicion has fallen on teams and players in the lower divisions of the game, the prestigious Serie A is increasingly being drawn into the scandal. None of this will come as any great surprise to those who are following this scandal closely. More painful and damaging, allegations and revelations lie ahead. Of course the fans hate it all, but many will continue to believe that the great bulk of players are clean. And some will argue that at least Italy is trying to tackle the match-fixing issue - while leagues in other countries may be choosing to look away. Five people were also arrested in Hungary on suspicion of being part of an illegal international betting ring. Police said Conte was being investigated on suspicion of sporting fraud and fraudulent association over allegations concerning a match between his previous club Siena and Novara in April 2011. However Conte's lawyer, Antonio De Rencis, said: "Conte's reaction is that of someone who is completely innocent and strongly determined to prove his total innocence." Later on Monday Italian football federation vice president Demetrio Albertini announced that Cristico, a former Genoa and Juventus defender who is now at Zenit St Petersburg in Russia, would not be selected for Euro 2012 'in order to clear his name'. "We are disappointed but we have to remain close to the player," Albertini said. "Arrests have been made today but until proven otherwise, we are talking about innocent people even though they are considered suspects. "I know Domenico and he is incredulous. He is an extraordinary guy and he has already seen his lawyers this morning. It is a strange day for us. "These are things that we would not like to have had to go through." Monday's operation was part of a wider investigation which has already seen a number of arrests of current and former Italian players. In June last year, the Interior Ministry set up a special match-fixing task force in response to a number of high-profile cases. Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci has also been linked to match-fixing in testimony from a probe in Bari, where he used to play, but is not under formal investigation and will go to the tournament in Ukraine and Poland. Former Atalanta captain and Italy midfielder Cristiano Doni was banned for three-and-a-half years in August for his part in the 'Calcioscommesse' scandal involving Serie B matches last season. He was also arrested in December 2011 over match-fixing and betting allegations. Atalanta, promoted from Serie B, were deducted six points in the top flight this season as a result of the scandal. Former Lazio and Italy striker Giuseppe Signori was banned for five years and 15 other players were banned for between one and five years for their parts. Mauri, who joined the Rome club from Udinese in 2006 and has 11 caps for Italy, made 16 league appearances last season as Lazio finished fourth in Serie A. Milanetto, 36, signed for Serie B side Padova last summer after five years at Genoa and made 15 starts last season.	The captain of Lazio has been arrested by police investigating claims of match-fixing.
A retired British doctor is hoping to trace the descendants of allied soldiers and nurses portrayed in a celebrated collection of World War One pastels. Doug Jenkinson, 70, became aware of the work of Swiss artist Eugene Burnand while exploring his own family history. From 1917-21 Burnand scoured three French cities finding sitters from over 40 nations. Not only did he seek out decorated officers, but ordinary soldiers, nurses, stretcher bearers and labourers. His portraits hang in the Museum of the Legion of Honour in Paris which is planning a centennial exhibition. A friend of Dr Jenkinson, Shirley Darlington, was so captivated by the images she wrote a book about the artist. "When you look at the portraits you can see their individual characteristics and their humanity. I think if their relatives knew of these portraits they would be so interested and proud of their ancestors." she added. Eugene Burnand's wife, Julia Girardet, would help him look for potential sitters by approaching people in uniform on the Paris Metro. His friend, Louis Gillet, who was an art historian and critic, described the sittings as "resembling a confessional", with Burnand sitting knee-to-knee with his subjects at his home. Burnand was quite well known at the time and the French military allowed him to visit barracks, where soldiers would be either recuperating or resting from action on the front line. Australian soldier Robert Hamilton later wrote in his diary about being approached by the artist while he was having breakfast. "Thought I was a typical Aussie, so more out of curiosity and to break the monotony of sightseeing I went. He treated me well and for two days I was well dug in at his home." The great-great granddaughter of French Alpine infantryman Fernand Ruan contacted Dr Jenkinson after finding her relative's picture on his website. The family sent him a photograph of Mr Ruan taken in 1973 (below right). He died seven years later. I tracked down the descendants of one of Eugene Burnand's British sitters, Rear Adm Sir Edward Heaton-Ellis. His great-great niece, Charlotte Chichester, had no idea about the portrait and said that despite his calm air of authority he had a tough life. Rear Adm Heaton-Ellis lost his parents as a small child and was brought up by his grandmother before going to a naval college at 14 and was sent to sea soon afterwards. He was decorated for his bravery and daring as Captain of the Inflexible at the Battle of Jutland. Despite surviving World War One he lost both his sons, one in action and the other to the flu epidemic of 1918. Eugene Burnand's great-granddaughter Francoise Witheridge said the portraits were his way of recognising the sacrifice made by so many different nationalities. "There were people coming from completely different countries to save France. I think that is what is most moving. "You see the portrait of the Sikh, the man from Baluchistan, the New Zealander, the Fijian. "Really it was his way of wanting to remember them all and thank them and the way he drew them was knee-to-knee and he must really have looked at them and talked to them and understood them." After the artist died in 1922, a limited number of books were published with prints of the portraits. The headmaster of Whitgift School in Croydon, Christopher Barnett, has put on display a collection of original prints in an exhibition entitled Remembering 1916. While the portraits have been exhibited in France in Switzerland he says they have never been shown in the UK. "They have a freshness in their pastel and pencil drawings and are representative of the men and women who suffered at that time," he said. He unearthed an original Burnand portrait not included in the Paris collection which he found in a book he bought at auction. It is thought just 12 of those first edition books had a unique original portrait and Dr Barnett would love to trace them. While the stories of some of the sitters have emerged, there are hopes that their descendants will come forward to reclaim a little of their family history.

He said he disagreed with the views expressed by FTSE 100 bosses in a letter published on Tuesday. Heads of companies including BT, Marks & Spencer and Vodafone said an EU exit would deter investment in the UK. But Mr Woodford argued it was very difficult to build a credible economic argument for the UK either staying in or leaving the union. Rather, the debate was a political argument about issues such as immigration and sovereignty, he said. The long-term economic implications may not be as extreme as some have suggested, but regardless of the outcome of the 23 June referendum the effect would be profound, according to the high-profile fund manager. A vote to leave could also spark a crisis for the EU project, which Mr Woodford said was facing an array of challenges on a macro-economic and political level. There were fundamental political differences between member states on a range of important issues, as well as an immigration crisis and a stagnant eurozone economy. "ECB chief Mario Draghi is printing money and trying to do his bit, but the macro headwinds are intense and unemployment remains high. It is these problems that a UK exit could shine a brighter light on," Mr Woodford told the BBC. He believed investors should be braced for more "extraordinary monetary policy" by the world's central banks, such as negative interest rates and negative yields on 10-year government bonds. The global economy also faced a slowdown as well as the threat of deflation, while big problems remained in China, which was adjusting to cope with much slower economic growth. Major FTSE 100 companies such as Shell, BP and HSBC would all be forced to cut their dividends this year amid continuing low oil prices and poor investment returns, Mr Woodford predicted. On Tuesday, mining giant BHP Billiton said it was slashing its dividend, abandoning a long-held policy of maintaining or increasing payments to shareholders, reducing the payout from 62 US cents a share to just 16 cents. Mr Woodford is considered in the industry as one of the UK's best-performing fund managers. He rose to prominence during a 25-year career at Invesco Perpetual for taking a long-term view on investments. One of the best-known examples of his strategy was refusing to invest in the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Last year he set up his own fund, Woodford Investment Management.	Leaving the EU would not necessarily damage the UK economy, fund manager Neil Woodford has reiterated.
Not that long ago, lenders made it easy for people in their early 20s to climb onto the nearest ladder by offering interest-only mortgages. As house prices rose year after year, homes looked like a solid investment. There appeared to be little danger of buyers slipping down to where they started. Then the financial crisis hit, the board became a seething mass of snakes, and the property market did not seem as easy to play after all. So, how has the game changed now, and what is facing those who fell back to having to start all over again? With an interest-only mortgage, householders pay off the interest on the loan but not the capital. At the end of the mortgage term, borrowers are expected to repay the capital. The attraction of interest-only mortgages was obvious to many young first-time buyers. Many were aged in their early 20s, had just started their first job, and were happy to put off any real consideration of how they would pay the loan back, or to rely solely on the rising value of their home. In addition, they were cheaper than the repayment option. But, as they became more and more popular, this type of mortgage was placed more frequently under the microscope of the City regulator - the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In 2006, when 24% of all new mortgages were lent on an interest-only basis, the FSA said most people with interest-only mortgages did not have "robust plans" to repay them "There is nothing wrong with interest-only mortgages," said Clive Briault, of the FSA, six years ago. "However, consumers must be very clear about how they are going to repay the loans they take out." That comment may sound familiar because just a few weeks ago, Martin Wheatley, the managing director of the FSA said almost exactly the same thing. "There is a place for interest-only," he told a mortgage industry conference. "Lenders must ensure these mortgages are taken out by consumers with a concrete repayment plan." The fears may not have changed, but the market for interest-only mortgages certainly has. In the last week or so, RBS, NatWest and the Coventry Building Society have pulled out of the market altogether. They followed a withdrawal in October by the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide. "Whether this is the ultimate final nail in the coffin remains to be seen, but it does look increasingly like interest only is destined to survive only as a niche product or the preserve of the wealthy through the private banking fraternity," said Andrew Montlake, director at mortgage broker Coreco. The only lender to ease its stance is Santander which, after cutting back sharply on interest-only, is now allowing a mix of interest-only and repayment under a new deal. The FSA would be pleased to see interest-only disappearing for good as a mainstream product, but that is not a view shared by everyone. Source: Moody's Investors Service Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: "Interest-only is increasingly becoming a niche product, the preserve of wealthier borrowers. It is a shame as you don't necessarily have to be wealthy to have a viable repayment strategy for an interest-only loan." That refers to people like Malcolm King. He took out an interest-only mortgage more than 25 years ago, says he has never missed a payment, and has always had a plan to pay off the capital - based on investments and the success of his business. "I made a decision and take total responsibility for it," he says. "Most people went into this with their eyes open." He says that, as he is now aged 61, he had to "grovel" to his lender to be allowed to continue borrowing on the same terms, even though he had a successful business and a solid repayment plan. It is likely that Mr King, who lives in Cobham in Surrey, will not be the only homeowner in his part of the world facing the need to grovel to a lender. A recent report by Moody's Investors Service suggests that more than half of all outstanding mortgages are interest only in the south of England, compared with a third in the north of England. "Less creditworthy borrowers [are] at risk of being unable to refinance onto new rates," the report said. This means they face being locked into a mortgage, and have no choice but pay higher rates when their current deal expires. Under FSA regulations, which will come into force in April 2014, lenders will have to put this repayment plan under greater scrutiny with a full affordability assessment. To help these mortgage prisoners, the FSA has suggested that a new or existing lender can waive the rules for borrowers, who demonstrate a good payment history and do not want to increase the loan, to be able to shift onto a new deal. In contrast, first-time buyers will be given the third degree. The effect of this, according to estate agents, is that most are seeking the financial help of family and friends, and ensure they have their mortgage agreed before they even start searching for a home. Beckenham in Kent is a prime spot for such buyers. Good schools and convenient links to London mean it is popular with young families and professionals. But, according to Robert Dabrowski, of estate agent Langford Russell, the interest-only mortgage is a "dead market" to those first-time buyers they see. As a result, he says that first-time buyers have got older recently, and he is seeing more people buying as couples rather than on their own. Warren Pinner, sales director at neighbouring Curran and Pinner, says that first-time buyers with their finance already organised can make life a lot easier for estate agents. However, he predicts a steady return among some mortgage providers of home loans with an interest-only element. This is not a view not shared by everyone, and would certainly not mean a wholesale return of solely interest-only mortgages. This may place more snakes on the property board, but they should be easier to avoid for those seeking to climb onto the nearest ladder.	In the game of snakes and property ladders, winning now looks a lot more difficult for young buyers.
LF15, nicknamed "Lassie", touched down on Thursday afternoon to join her mate LM12, who arrived on 17 March. The charity said Lassie began rearranging her nest before the birds made their first attempts at mating. The pair, who can be watched on the reserve's live webcam, fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016. Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, said: "We knew it was LF15 as soon as she arrived. "She has unmistakable features including a prominent dark brown "Y" on the top of her head and quickly set to work rearranging her nest to her satisfaction." Ms Fleming said LM12, who has spent the last week fending off crows and creating a deep cup on the nest to hold this season's eggs, joined his mate within an hour. She said: "While it was a frosty reception with lots of shouting and mantling at first, it only took a matter of minutes for them to begin to mate."	A female osprey has reunited with her mate at the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Loch of the Lowes reserve in Perthshire.
Salem, the state capital, hired a herd of 75 goats to munch their way through plants like Armenian blackberry in the city's largest park. But costs came to more than five times the city would have spent on human landscapers, a report found. The goats also ate native plants among the invasive species, the report added. The six-week pilot programme ended last November and there are no plans to renew it, city officials said. Aside from their cost, the goats left behind a "heavily fertilized area", the city's public works operations manager Mark Becktel told the Statesman Journal. The park was also said to have a "barnyard aroma" due to the goats' presence.	Oregon will not be renewing a scheme which uses goats to eat invasive species due to rising costs and complaints over the animals' odour.
With temperatures at Indian Wells in excess of 105 degrees, Evans broke in the opening game but world number five Nishikori hit back immediately and captured the set in 42 minutes. Breaks were traded again at the start of the second before Nishikori sealed the match in an hour and 24 minutes. Kyle Edmund is also out, 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to defending champion Novak Djokovic. Following the surprise defeat of world number one Andy Murray at the hands of qualifier Vasek Pospisil the previous evening, Evans, 26, produced a spirited performance, but some pinpoint accuracy from Nishikori saw him break again in game eight of the first set. World number 41 Evans, who beat Dustin Brown in the previous round, continued to frequently match the quality of his Japanese opponent's groundstrokes but gradually faded as the assured Nishikori moved through to face Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in round three.

Mourad Laachraoui, brother of Najim Laachraoui, won the -54kg final in Montreux, Switzerland, on Thursday. He beat 18-year-old Spanish fighter Jesus Tortosa 6-3 to claim the title. The 21-year-old, who will compete at Rio 2016, has said he was "scared and saddened" by his brother's role in the attack on the Belgian capital in March. Speaking at a news conference he arranged in Brussels following the attacks, Mourad Laachraoui also said no-one in his family had heard from his brother since 2013. Najim, 24, was one of two men who carried out devastating bomb attacks in the check-in area of Zaventem airport on 22 March. A third bomb was detonated at Maelbeek metro station shortly after, with a total of 32 people killed. Prosecutors have also linked him to November's attacks in Paris in which 130 people died.	A Belgian whose older brother was one of the suicide bombers in the terror attacks on Brussels has won gold at the European Taekwondo Championships.
Operations are due to resume early next week after a meeting between NHS bosses and other partners on Thursday night. Data suggested death rates there were double that of other centres, but experts have questioned their accuracy. However, the Department of Health (DoH) said the NHS was right to investigate safety at the unit. A spokesperson said: "We support NHS England and the trust in their decision to suspend surgery last week on the basis that there were serious concerns that needed to be investigated. "If the trust and the regulators are content that these concerns can now be explained or addressed then we would support a joint decision to resume surgery." Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said work would be done over the weekend to give "sufficient assurance" the unit is safe to reopen, early next week. Doctors and other medical experts said the data on death rates had not been verified and was not fit to base a decision to close the unit on. Mortality data and staffing are just two of the concerns being looked at as part of a review into why children's cardiac surgery at Leeds General Infirmary was suspended last Thursday. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission have all been involved. The indication is that if the trust can provide strong assurances that heart surgery is safe, then the unit could reopen early next week. But discussions will continue over the weekend as part of the review, which is expected to last three weeks. If the unit does reopen, Leeds General Infirmary will have to reassure patients and families that safety of care is paramount. The NHS can ill afford another scandal after Mid Staffs. Yet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will probably have the last say on the future of children's heart services, at Leeds and elsewhere. A separate independent review is set to report to him on the whole restructuring of children's heart services in England. But, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said the figures were among a "constellation of reasons" the decision was made.  He has been backed by health secretary Jeremy Hunt. A senior Westminster source has told the BBC that "as far as the secretary of state is concerned, Sir Bruce Keogh was right to ask questions about the safety of heart surgery at the unit". Parents had criticised the timing of the suspension of surgery at the unit, which came 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of services was "legally flawed". Stuart Andrew, the Conservative MP for Pudsey, called for "some really serious investigating" into the decision to suspend surgery. Mr Andrew claimed a review of the mortality figures showed "Leeds is within the average and is a safe unit to use". He said recent events raised questions about the NHS decision to close the Leeds unit for good and concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer centres. "We are losing faith in that review process," said Mr Andrew. "Some of these people are the same people on that decision-making body." Lois Brown, whose five-year-old daughter had life-saving heart treatment at the hospital, described the decision to restart surgery as "fantastic". Ms Brown has been involved in the campaign and court action to save the unit from closure. She said she wanted answers as to why the unit was shut. "I'm really relieved that children are going to get surgery at Leeds again," she said. "For the past week and a bit we have been putting children's lives at risk for no reason, apparently."	Children's heart surgery is set to restart at Leeds General Infirmary, a week after it was claimed data showed higher-than-usual death rates there.
But at one school in Essex you could probably not blame two of them for forgetting where they are for a moment. By day, Danny and Nicky Cowley teach boys physical education at The FitzWimarc School in Rayleigh. But in evenings and weekends, the pair are pulling off a "miracle" in the National League. Danny, assisted by brother Nicky, has led part-timers Braintree Town to the verge of the National League play-offs, above former Football League clubs Tranmere, Wrexham and Macclesfield. "Every morning I enjoy going to work, whether it's at school with the pupils or whether I'm at Braintree Town with the players," he told BBC Essex. "It's only work if you don't enjoy it and I love what I do. "I look forward to the summer, but we all know for football managers there's no such thing. You're normally more busy in the close season than you are during the season. "It's about trying to be successful and the only way I know to do that is to work hard." Since Cowley left Concord Rangers to replace Alan Devonshire 12 months ago, the Essex club have been on an upward trajectory. Despite criticising the National League schedule after four matches in 10 days and having to deal with a number of postponements, Cowley has won 22 of his 45 league matches in charge. Now all that is left to do to finish in the top five is draw against struggling Altrincham on Saturday. "I think we've been dreaming all season," he said. "I haven't got quite this far in the dream so I'm expecting someone to wake me up and I'm not quite sure how it unfolds. "It's important we don't get ahead of ourselves. The moment you think you've worked [football] out, it normally bites you on the bum. "A lot of people from the outside question how and why we are where we are in the league when you consider how many big clubs are in it. "Saturday's an opportunity to say we might be a small club, an unromantic name with average facilities, but we have really good players in that dressing room." Cowley has been here before. During his eight years as Concord boss he guided them to three promotions and left them in the Conference South. And he wants a team representing a town of just over 41,000 to show no fear as they close in on the Football League for the first time. "I've been in these weeks before at the end of the season, and the best way to approach them is to put as much effort and work as intelligently as you can from Monday to Friday," he said. "If you do that, you wake up Saturday morning kind of without any pressure because you know you've done everything you can. "There should be no fear or anxiety in our group. The only thing running through our veins should be pride of what we've done. "I'm sure whatever happens the people of Braintree will be really proud of this group but we know there's a possibility of us doing something that will probably never be forgotten. "We'll use that to drive us, we'll embrace it - if you don't enjoy it, what's the point?" As a result of his success at Cressing Road, Cowley has been linked with the vacant Colchester United job following their relegation to League Two. Cowley says he "owes it to Braintree" to not have his head turned by the speculation, and that he has not thought about beyond this season. "We're on a journey at the moment, we're a part-time club and I'm a part-time manager," he said. "As a football manager you have to put everyone else first. I don't always think about myself and I try to put all my energy into my players. "That's what I'll continue to do until this process is over. When the season ends, then we'll draw breath and take it from there."

11 April 2016 Last updated at 18:11 BST Alex Zosel told the BBC that his device was safer than a traditional helicopter because its systems had more redundancy built-in. The Volocopter can continue to fly if some of its batteries or rotors fail, and can land itself when battery power is low. However, the multicopter can currently fly for only 25 minutes and is expected to cost Â£200,000 when it goes on sale.	An 18-rotor multicopter has been taken on its first manned flight in Germany.
The 2ft (60cm) statue of a young girl was presented to Burhill Primary School, in Pleasant Place, Hersham, in memory of the former pupil. The eight-year-old was murdered by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting in West Sussex in 2000. The statue was discovered after it was left outside a property in Cobham. Three people were thought to be involved in theft, which happened at about 01:00 GMT on Wednesday, Surrey Police said. The statue was believed to have been left outside the address in Northfield road between 05:15 and 07:30 on Thursday. Sgt Marc Nettleingham said: "The member of the public who found the statue, which is thankfully undamaged, had seen our appeal on Facebook. "We are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft." Police said a van was also seen in the area at the time of the theft.	A bronze statue commemorating murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne that was stolen from her primary school in Surrey has been found.
But the objects are just some of the Mary Rose artefacts which have gone on display at Swansea University. Researchers have been examining the artefacts from Henry VIII's warship, which was raised in 1982, to discover more about the ship's crew. Their work has revealed that many of those who perished when the boat sank in 1545 were "superb athletes". Sport physiologist Dr Nick Owen said the skeletons and objects raised with the Mary Rose have given them a "wealth of information". "The abnormalities in some of the crew's radius bones shows that they'd have been supreme athletes," Dr Owen said. "Today an Olympic bow has 48 lbs of tension, but to fire a Mary Rose bolt (arrow) would have taken well over 100 lbs." Dr Owen believes that as well as providing a glimpse into the past, his team's discoveries can offer an insight into the injuries of modern athletes. "You can see similar abnormalities in elite tennis and squash players," he said. "Top sportsmen are singled out for elite training from such a young age. "The cream of archers on the Mary Rose would have been in training since they were seven years old." Dr Owen's team, including scientists from the University of Bradford, have already succeeded in creating an online 3D image of some of the sailors, which can be remotely studied by scientists. The next challenge is to see what lies inside the bones. "Once we can conduct Micro CT scans, we'll be able to see what changes being one of Henry VIII's elite archers caused internally," Dr Owen explained. "These very fine scans will help us discover how their lifestyle and diet affected their bone structure from the inside." The Mary Rose artefacts are on display to mark the university's research and innovation awards evening.	A boot, some old skeletons and a block of wood might not sound like the type of thing to entice you to Swansea.
Border Force officers searched a trailer at Immingham Docks which had arrived from the Netherlands on Thursday night. They found 8,960,000 cigarettes inside 20 wooden pallets. If undetected, the Border Force estimated the haul would have cost the Treasury Â£2.5m in unpaid duty and VAT.	Almost nine million cigarettes hidden inside packages labelled as containing wooden flooring have been seized at a port on the River Humber.
The Ministry of Justice announced a new formula for calculating compensation payments for those who suffer long-term injuries, which means insurers will have to increase payouts. As a result, Direct Line said profits for 2016 had fallen 30% to £353m. However, it said it had seen strong growth in home and car insurance. While the changes to compensation calculations affected Direct Line's results for 2016, the company added that it did "not expect any material residual impact on 2017 profit" as a result of the reform. When the change to the payout formula was announced, a number of insurance companies said their profits would be hit. The Ministry of Justice said it was reducing what is known as the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75%. The move will result in more money for the victims of accidents, and so increase costs for insurance companies.	Insurance company Direct Line has said last week's changes to the way accident victims are compensated has dented pre-tax profits by £217m.
The 14-year-old boy who was injured was walking with a 15-year-old boy when he was struck in Fernhill Road, near Rutherglen, at 14:15 on 24 January. Police previously said a light-green Vauxhall Corsa mounted the pavement before heading off towards Castlemilk. They have now arrested a 16-year-old male. He is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday.	A teenager has been arrested in connection with an alleged hit-and-run incident which left a boy in hospital.
