Undercover researchers filmed Ashley Commerce College in Ilford sitting or forging exams for untrained students to become security guards or bodyguards. Some 20 courses have now been cancelled while authorities investigate. About 90 would-be students have been refunded. College director Haji Yunis told the BBC he was co-operating with inquiries. Secretly filmed footage had showed Mr Yunis laughing about the scam he presided over. He told the researcher that for Â£1,200 he would "bring you in the back door" and "fast track" him to a bodyguard qualification without any training. Mr Yunis told the researcher not to worry about the police. Fraudulent use of SIA cards in fact carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. Both the exam board whose certification was fraudulently obtained, Industry Qualifications (IQ), and the Security Industry Authority (SIA) are investigating the college. An audit is currently taking place, with the aim of ascertaining how many qualifications awarded at the college to enable security guards to become licensed by the SIA were bogus. Jobseekers must sit mandatory exams to get an SIA card. A statement placed on Ashley Commerce College's website by IQ read: "Following the BBC broadcast, IQ has been working with the regulators Ofqual and the SIA to formulate a plan for identifying learners affected by the fraud. "We do expect to find evidence that some learners have received their qualifications without having done their course or tests properly. These qualifications will be reviewed. "We know that this will leave many learners who attended ACC worried about the authenticity of their qualifications and IQ is working hard to find out how many learners may be affected." The statement said every student who obtained an SIA licence through the college may be affected. The college has been operating since 2010. The statement added: "Where we cannot guarantee that a qualification has not been affected by fraud, we are required to remove the qualification immediately and notify the Security Industry Authority." Mr Yunis would not say how many students' qualifications were now being reviewed. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called the fraud a "major scandal". A Home Office spokesman has said any criminal behaviour would be addressed.	All courses on offer at a college exposed selling fraudulent security qualifications for cash have now been cancelled, the BBC has learned.
The union organisation said bosses should be happy with staff wearing vest tops and shorts rather than tights or jackets and ties during the hot spell. Fans should be available in offices without air conditioning, it urged. Firms should also supply cold drinks and allow employees to take frequent breaks, it said, as temperatures are expected to rise to 30C (86F). Plans are already in place for some local trains to operate at reduced speed, and the TUC said that commuters and workers should be given flexibility at times of high temperatures. "It is no fun working in a baking office or factory and employers should do all they can to take the temperature down," said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. "Clearly vest tops and shorts are not suitable attire for all frontline staff, but those not dealing with the public should be able to discard their tights, ties and suits." The Chartered Management Institute echoed the TUC's call for flexible working, claiming that many businesses underestimated the effect that weather conditions could have on output. "It is therefore vital for employers to ensure they have business continuity plans in place to prepare for these situations, to ensure that productivity doesn't drop and that flexible working arrangements are on offer, should employees require these," it said.	Staff should be allowed to dress down and work flexible hours during the hot spell of weather, the TUC has said.
Winch operator Paul Ormsby and winch man Ciarán Smith have been missing since Rescue 116 crashed off the County Mayo coast on 14 March. The Irish Coast Guard said the search would now also cover coastline along Counties Donegal and Galway. Four people were on board the helicopter when it came down. Capt Dara Fitzpatrick died after she was rescued from the sea hours after the crash. The body of her co-pilot, Capt Mark Duffy, was later recovered from the wreckage. On Sunday, the wreckage of the helicopter was lifted from the Irish Sea but the two missing crew members were not found. The Irish Coast Guard, writing on social media, said underwater searches would resume on Thursday, weather permitting. The extension of the search comes after the sister of Ciarán Smith appealed for fishermen along the Irish coast to join the search. Orla Smith said that local knowledge could be crucial in finding the two men. An investigation into what happened to the helicopter is continuing. The Air Accident Investigation Unit has said there was no indication of any mechanical problems in the seconds before the impact. It is thought the inquiry into the cause of the crash on 14 March will now focus on operational issues.	The search for two Irish Coast Guard crew members missing since a helicopter crash has been extended along the Irish coast.
John Ashton, professor of banking at Bangor University, studied 17 years of bank account data to examine the costs faced by customers. He told the BBC that it was well documented that overdrafts were an expensive form of borrowing. What was overlooked was the "cost" of keeping large deposits in an account. By doing so, customers were missing out on much higher levels of interest that would be paid in a better home for their savings. "It is a surprise how large these amounts can be [in current accounts] - many thousands of pounds," he said. It might be possible to manage a current account to make the most of the system but, for many, the best way to get value for money is by switching to another current account altogether. Bank customers could save £70 a year on average by switching their account to another provider, an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded. Why? The CMA explains: "We looked at the average charges for a customer who was £500 in credit and had a number of foreign exchange transactions in a year, and tried to work it out, if they switched to a different type of account, and we found that, if they switched to a reward account under which they received cashback rewards and interest on their credit balances, they would make the £70 saving." For those who go into the red, the savings made by switching would be even greater, the CMA suggested. The average overdraft user could save £140 a year. Heavy overdraft users could save £260. Switching is relatively simple. It is a seven-day process and all existing regular payments, incoming and outgoing, are automatically diverted to the new account. Customers, for the most part, remain unmoved despite the simplicity of the system. Last year, 1.03 million current accounts were switched last year, compared with 1.15 million the previous year. That is a fraction of the 68 million active current accounts in the UK. Commentators suggest, despite a big advertising campaign, customers do not swap owing to a lack of trust in banks to ensure direct debits are automatically switched to the new account. They also say that the complexity of these accounts and the lack of a clear "price" make it enormously difficult to decide between the options. There are 269 different current account options to choose from for UK consumers, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. One of the High Street giants - Barclays - has 69 different options on its own, although they are not all available to everyone. Customers who do attempt to find a better deal are met by a blizzard of numbers when comparing the charges levied by each account. For overdrafts, there may be authorised overdraft fees, overdraft arrangement fees, overdraft review fees, as well as the same again for going into the red without prior authorisation from the bank. To add an extra layer of complexity, the cost of an overdraft is not always clear from the interest charged. For example, two banks charge 15.9% interest on overdrafts but borrowing £500 for two weeks costs £17 with one bank, but £27 with another. Why? One of the banks does not charge for the first £250 that is borrowed. Frustrated customers, by sticking with the account they had got and paying the fees regardless, ultimately faced extra expense, the competition authority suggested. "Banks have an incentive to set high overdraft charges, due to the lack of customer engagement," the CMA concluded. There is also a range of costs for more specialist services. Different fees are charged, for example, for banker's drafts, same-day transfers of large amounts of money, and transactions in foreign currencies. That is the complexity of costs, so what about judging the benefits offered with accounts? Since Prof Ashton's work was published in 2013, banks have become more likely to offer a cash incentive to customers to switch to one of their accounts, and rewards for regular use of the account. Packaged accounts, which have been around for some time, charge a fee but include add-ons such as insurance products. Reward accounts may also charge a fee but may also offer cash upfront, as well as cashback or savings if the account is used in certain transactions - such as paying household bills or shopping at certain stores. The sting may be charges elsewhere, such as going overdrawn. "Customers should choose a current account based on its overall package to ensure it covers all their financial requirements. This is particularly important if they want a reasonable overdraft to cover any unexpected outgoings, otherwise they could end up being stung with excessive fees," said Rachel Springall, of Moneyfacts. Sir Donald Cruickshank conducted a well-received review into the UK banking industry for the government nearly 16 years ago in which he highlighted the stranglehold of the biggest banks on the market. He is more upbeat about the market now, and said bank accounts with a subscription fee were a sign of progress. Monthly fees for current accounts, which changed over time, were good for the market, even if they were not always good for the consumer, he said. "There are more banks [than in 2000], it is easier to get banking licences, and it is easier to compete," he told BBC News. "The average customer of the big banks does not particularly want to switch. They want to know that they are getting as good a deal as they could get elsewhere. "There has been a response from the established players [because] they know that the new ones can take their business away." Unpicking the current account banking "con-trick" How to leave your bank ... in 60 seconds The bank switching plan explained Banking apps: What are they and how do they work? Consumers are still faced with such complexity when choosing an account, but one source of relief for consumers, according to the CMA, is a new system that automates the choice using information on bank statements about previous spending. The idea of the government-backed "Midata" project is that customers download data of previous transactions into a price comparison website and it crunches the numbers to suggest where they might get a better deal. But the CMA says the scheme still has lots of shortcomings, not least that it does not work if customers are using one of the most popular smartphones in the UK - the iPhone. Two other major difficulties are still to be resolved with this project. Firstly, consumer research suggests the majority of people would be unlikely to use the service owing to fears about giving their personal data to a price comparison website. The second, as MPs pointed out, was that an estimated 11 million people are not "functionally literate" on the internet. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, told the BBC News website that the CMA seemed to be "passing the buck". "The CMA seemed to be saying that consumers need to take more responsibility. But most do not have the tools to do it. Many lack the computer skills. In any case, many are also wary of sharing their data," he told BBC News. The issue is on the list of possible "remedies" produced by the CMA. Its final view on those is expected to be published in the coming weeks. Tomorrow: The only truly free current account	The most affordable way of holding a bank current account, an academic has concluded, is to keep small sums in it but to never go overdrawn.
Owners Hanwha Chemical Corp said the blast happened during welding work to expand a waste water disposal facility. "Gas from the waste water, which had piled up inside the tank, was apparently ignited by the welding torch", a fire official told AFP. An investigation into whether negligence was the cause of the explosion is under way. The plant makes polyvinyl chloride used in wide range of products, such as cling film.	At least four people have been killed in South Korea in an explosion at a chemical plant in the city of Ulsan.
A 27-year-old man and a woman, 32, were detained after the 60-year-old victim's body was found at the Forest Gate house, early on Christmas Day. Four people escaped from the house on Field Road before firefighters arrived just before 04:45 GMT. A post-mortem test showed the victim had died from burns and the inhalation of fumes, the Met Police said. Fire crews found his body on the ground-floor of the two-storey house. Police believe "the fire was started deliberately" and say they believe they know who the victim was, but formal identification has not yet been made. Twenty one firefighters and four engines tackled the blaze, which was brought under control after about two-and-a-half hours. Det Ch Insp Steve McCabe said: "I need to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in Field Road and the surrounding area in the early hours of Christmas Day."	Two people are being held on suspicion of murder after a man was found dead following a house fire in London.
Keepers at Drusillas Park in Alfriston could not work out why Sofia and male Tupee had failed to bond since being introduced to each other in 2011. Head keeper Mark Kenward said it was not easy to establish the sex of a sloth and medical records had shown Sofia was female when she arrived. "We are going to have to find a more suitable name for Sofia," he said. It is likely that either Tupee or Sofia will now be re-homed to another zoo, and another female introduced. Mr Kenward said: "We had never looked after sloths before and were relying on the information provided. "Unfortunately we cannot keep our two boys together and it would also be a waste of their breeding potential." After enlisting the help of Bristol Zoo, Mr Kenward said it all made "perfect sense" given the problems they had been experiencing with the animals.	A pair of sloths at an East Sussex zoo failed to breed after it emerged that they were both in fact males.
Gilmour's Rattle That Lock topped the official chart nearly 20,000 copies ahead of Del Rey's record, Honeymoon. It is the guitarist's second solo number one, after 2006's On An Island. He last topped the charts in November, with Pink Floyd's The Endless River. "It's thrilling to get a number one," he said. "We all want to hit the top spot, however long we've been at it." Gilmour easily outpaced the competition in a big week for new releases. He was joined in the Top 40 by new albums from Keith Richards, Drake & Future and Gabrielle Aplin. Cliff Richard scored his 43rd top 10 album with the greatest hits collection 75 at 75, which landed at number four. And country singer Ryan Adams also made a new appearance at 19, thanks to his "cover album" of Taylor Swift's 1989. The original was two places higher, marking its 48th week in the top 40. In the singles chart, Justin Bieber spent a third week at number one with his tropical dance track, What Do You Mean? - which was streamed 3.2 million times over the last week. The Canadian singer has a fight on his hands next week from Sam Smith's Bond theme, Writing's On The Wall, which has already  topped the iTunes chart after eight hours on sale. Elsewhere in the top 40, Ellie Goulding scored her tenth Top 10 hit with On My Mind - the first single from her forthcoming album Delirium. The song was originally released last Thursday, making it chart-eligible for 24 hours, during which time it reached number 165. This week, it climbed 158 places to land at number seven. Other new entries included Runnin' (Lose It All), a collaboration between Beyonce and British producer Naughty Boy, which debuted at 11. One Direction's Infinity, which became available on Tuesday to coincide with the announcement of the band's fifth album, Made In The AM, made its initial chart showing at number 36. As well as Sam Smith, this week sees new singles from Little Mix and Rudimental featuring Ed Sheeran. New Order, Disclosure, Chvrches and former Westlife member Shane Filan will all be vying to score the number one album.	Lana Del Rey has been denied her third consecutive number one on the UK album chart by Pink Floyd star David Gilmour.
Trustees of the Cwmaman Institute said they had six-figure debts and were struggling to keep the building open. Opened in 1892 for the local mining community, the building had a Â£3.8m lottery-funded facelift in 2001 unveiled by the Prince of Wales. Trust chairman John Oliver said they were warning groups using the venue it faced closure by the end of the year. "It's been a struggle for a number of years, and we've been running it on a voluntary basis for the main part," he said. "We hope something will crop up - we've written to Stereophonics but haven't heard back from them yet," Mr Oliver added. "We'd be pleased if they said they could help us." Stereophonics - formed in Cwmaman in the 1990s by Kelly Jones, Richard Jones and the late Stuart Cable - played some of their first gigs at the institute before winning international fame. In July trustees sold a neighbouring pub - the Shepherd's Arms - to raise funds as part of the effort to save the venue.	Rock stars Stereophonics have been asked to help save a venue where they played some of their first gigs.
It has launched a plan to update and co-ordinate national tax laws. There was criticism in the UK earlier this year when it emerged that Google, Starbucks and Amazon paid little tax despite having big UK operations. Following that criticism Starbucks agreed to pay more tax. The OECD came up with the plan at the request of the G20 group of leading nations. Finance ministers from the G20 are meeting in Moscow. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said: "International tax rules, many of them dating from the 1920s, ensure that businesses don't pay taxes in two countries - double taxation. By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent It's a plan to produce a plan. At a time when there's much controversy about corporate tax, the OECD has certainly succeeded in grabbing the headlines. But will it produce any real results? There is significant political support for the idea of a crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and several other European finance ministers have been pushing this agenda. In the United States there is political capital to be earned by being tough on multinationals. Nonetheless, the OECD still has to come up with the detailed proposals and then governments have to choose to implement them. Some probably will be co-operative. But the OECD has no power to compel those who are not. "This is laudable, but unfortunately these rules are now being abused to permit double non-taxation." It is calling for greater international co-operation to close gaps that allows income to "disappear" for tax purposes. The OECD also said that tax income should reflect the economic activity it generates. That would address some of the criticism aimed at big companies. Earlier this year, Google was fiercely criticised by UK MPs for routing Â£3.2bn of UK sales through Dublin and paying little tax as a result. Starbucks has been questioned for transferring money to a Dutch sister company in royalty payments. And Apple's chief executive Tim Cook was questioned by US lawmakers about the billions of dollars his company keeps in its Irish divisions. The companies point out that these schemes are legal and they have a duty to their shareholders to minimise their tax bills. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "delighted" the OECD had produced the report. "Taxpayers, governments and businesses all suffer when some companies manipulate the tax system to avoid paying their fair share of taxes," he said. The OECD hopes its recommendations will be put into action over the next two years and is working on an international legal structure that would help countries introduce the new rules quickly. "Multinationals still have not grasped that tax honesty is an integral part of corporate responsibility," said Florian Wettstein, professor of business ethics at the University of St. Gallen, based in Switzerland. "As a result, the public increasingly perceives them as hypocritical and untrustworthy." Campaigners say that aggressive tax policies are particularly hard on poorer nations, who need all the tax revenue they can generate. ActionAid tax campaigns manager Chris Jordan said: "For the developing countries that lose billions of dollars each year to aggressive tax avoidance, the stakes couldn't be higher. "It's vital that they have a seat at the table, so global tax rules aren't stitched up by the major powers."	Existing tax rules need updating as they can be "abused" by multinational companies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
A toxin in the sting kills cancer cells without harming normal cells, lab studies suggest. The University of Brazil team say the experimental therapy latches to tumour cells and makes them leak vital molecules. The work is at an early stage and more studies are needed to check the method will work safely in humans. Polybia paulista is an aggressive social wasp endemic in south-east Brazil. Though its sting is largely seen as unwelcome, scientists increasingly believe it could be put to good use. It contains an important toxin called MP1 which the insect uses to attack prey or defend itself. And recent studies in mice suggest it may target and destroy cancer cells. Prof Joao Ruggiero Netto and colleagues set out to discover how, by putting it under the microscope. They found MP1 interacts with fat molecules that are abnormally distributed on the surface of cancer cells, creating gaping holes that allow molecules crucial for cell function to leak out. In healthy cells, the same molecules are hidden on the inside. This means healthy tissue should avoid MP1's attack, the scientists say in Biophysical Journal. Co-researcher Dr Paul Beales, from the University of Leeds, said cancer therapies that attacked the lipid composition of the cell membrane would be an entirely new class of anti-cancer drugs. "This could be useful in developing new combination therapies, where multiple drugs are used simultaneously to treat a cancer by attacking different parts of the cancer cells at the same time," he said. Dr Aine McCarthy, science information officer for Cancer Research UK said: "This early stage research increases our understanding of how the venom of the Brazilian wasp can kill cancer cells in the laboratory. "But while these findings are exciting, much more work is needed in the lab and in clinical trials before we will know if drugs based on this research could benefit cancer patients."	The venom of a wasp native to Brazil could be used as a weapon to fight cancer, scientists believe.

The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: "The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. "The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats." Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a "serious concern". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. "There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland," added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. "For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. "The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure." Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a "monumental effort". "We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come," he said.	Hen harrier numbers have fallen by 9% in Scotland since 2010, according to the latest national survey.
The Good Morning Britain host had scoffed at the decision to host a Ferris wheel in Dudley. He told viewers even people in the town thought it had "a horrible view". However, local businessman Dave Carter launched a campaign to get people riding the attraction wearing the masks to mark April Fools' Day. About 40 people wearing the masks that were handed out in the town centre was granted a free ride before 10:00 BST. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Carter said about 4,000 people have ridden the 115ft (35.05m) high attraction, which has been branded "the worst tourist attraction in the UK", adding the wheel had done the town "a really big favour". "Most people have come along to see what all the fuss is about, and they're turning up to Dudley, doing a bit of shopping, going on the Eye and finding out that it's actually quite good," he said. "It was all in good humour - you could see people's tongues in their cheeks through the masks." Mr Morgan has been invited to Dudley to experience the ride, Mr Carter added, but he has not yet accepted the invitation.	Black Country residents have mocked TV presenter Piers Morgan by wearing masks of his face while riding a visitor attraction he publicly criticised.
Rose, 36, has played in 21 events since the PGA Tour season began in October, including Europe's Ryder Cup defeat. The world number 11 was in discomfort because of a disc herniation at The Players Championship in May. "I have decided to take the next eight weeks off for rest and recovery. At this point in my career, it's important to invest in my body," he said. "This time off is crucial for me to return to peak performance." The Englishman's Olympic win arrived after a number of players withdrew from the Games, citing concerns over the Zika virus and congestion in their season schedule. The gold represented the only win of his season and he will now miss next week's British Masters and the European Tour's Race to Dubai finale in November. Rose is one of four players to take turns in hosting the British Masters each year, along with Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and 2016 host Luke Donald.	Olympic champion Justin Rose will miss the rest of the 2015-16 season to fully recover from a back injury.

After a pregnancy lasting 22 months, Thi Hi Way, a 34-year-old Asian elephant at the zoo, gave birth to the female on Thursday afternoon. Zookeepers said the calf, which is yet to be named, was on its feet within three minutes and was doing well. Andy Mckenzie, team manager of elephants at Chester Zoo, described the "very smooth" birth as a "real family occasion". He said: "They all knew that something was going to happen, especially the older elephants that have seen it all before. "It was great to see the younger individuals being around the birth and learning from the older cows in the family."

Machetes, a knuckle duster and axes were recovered as part of a probe into the rival gangs, known as "Moorclose" and "Mandem" in west Cumbria. Cumbria Police said it had "nipped the problem in the bud" but still needed help to arrest more suspects. It set up Operation Rodeo to tackle the disorder in Workington and Whitehaven. Forty-three people have been arrested, aged between 13 and 40, who are all going through the court system, police said. Det Insp Dan St Quintin said: "The criminality our communities have experienced is totally unacceptable and police have nipped this in the bud. "I would like to reassure the public that we have a team of dedicated detectives working full time to detect and prosecute anyone found committing criminal behaviour."	More than 40 suspected gang members have been arrested on suspicion of a string of offences including possessing weapons and assault, police said.
Mhairi Black won the Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat for the SNP in last month's general election. The 20-year-old sat her final exam on Scottish politics shortly after being elected. She graduated along with the rest of her class in a ceremony at the university on Friday. Ms Black posted a photograph of herself in her gown on Twitter. She wrote: "Overwhelmed by all the messages of support. They're really appreciated. It's been a great day for everyone involved." Her graduation came seven weeks after being elected MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South. The student had yet to sit her final exam when she ousted Labour's Douglas Alexander to become the youngest member at Westminster since the Reform Act of 1832. She won her seat by 5,500 votes after overturning former Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander's 16,000 vote majority. The MP admitted recently that it was "quite bizarre" returning to university after being elected an MP. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, she said: "It was a brass neck walking into a room with people I've been studying with for years and they're all pulling their hair out applying for a million and one jobs and I'm like, 'Hi guys, how's it going?'." A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: "We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer. "They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers."	The youngest MP in the House of Commons has graduated with a first class honours degree in politics from Glasgow University.
The 34-year-old dominated opponent Aleksandr Nedovyesov for a 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 6-3 victory in the decisive singles rubber in Darwin. Earlier Sam Groth levelled the tie against Mikhail Kukushkin. Australia travel to Great Britain, who defeated France, for the last-four tie in September. Neither Hewitt nor Groth had initially been selected to play singles but captain Wally Masur dropped youngsters Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios after Kazakhstan had opened up a 2-0 lead. They teamed up to reduce the deficit in the doubles before victories in their respective singles matches saw them come back to win from 2-0 down for the first time since 1939. Hewitt, Wimbledon winner in 2002, embraced his team-mates after the victory, saying: "This is up there.  I love the back-against-the-wall situations. That's what we had after day one. "We had to rally together and find a way to get the win.  I've always said some of my greatest wins are in Davis Cup and some of my toughest losses are in Davis Cup so I'm going to enjoy this one. This is what dreams are made of."	Former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt guided Australia into the Davis Cup semi-finals as the hosts came from 2-0 down to beat Kazakhstan 3-2.
Media playback is not supported on this device With a host of governing bodies embroiled in bullying allegations, Grainger told BBC Sport that things "need to improve". In her first interview since being appointed to one of the most powerful roles in British sport, the former Olympic rower also warned the "risk" of a tougher financial future was another major challenge. However, the 41 year-old defended UK Sport's 'no-compromise' funding strategy, which allocates money according to medal potential, and has helped transform the country's Olympic and Paralympic fortunes. "Unfortunately, somehow the message has got out that 'no compromise' could mean 'winning at any costs' and that's not the case," said Grainger, who starts her role on 1 July. "It's not what anybody who believes in the positive force of sport would want to see." In a wide-ranging interview, Britain's most decorated female Olympian, who has a PhD in law, said her new role was "a huge privilege and responsibility". With little experience in sports administration, Grainger was a surprise appointment at such a critical time for UK Sport, but she said: "I was very serious about this job and would not have applied for it if I didn't think I could do it in a very credible way. "I was honest in the interview and said 'I haven't been a chair of anything like this before'. But I'm very keen to learn, and I've got a lot of incredible support around me." UK Sport has distributed £345m to 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports in the pursuit of medals at Tokyo 2020. Lottery funding has revolutionised elite performances over the last 20 years. But with ticket sales declining and the government unlikely to extend Exchequer support after the next summer Games, Grainger warned sports bodies would have to become "much more creative". "There are a lot of challenges facing British sport right now," she said. "I think everyone is acutely aware of it, nobody is hiding. One of the biggest challenges is financial, and it always will be. "I think UK Sport has been very well supported by the government and National Lottery for a long time, that's why we've seen such success. But we can't continue to rely on those sources to the extent we have done up until now. "I think everyone is aware of the risk going forward, and about the fall in lottery ticket sales. "So all different aspects of the sporting landscape must come together and appreciate the challenge we're all facing." After months of negative headlines, it has emerged that a third of UK Sport-funded governing bodies have had to confront athlete welfare issues or complaints, raising fears that medal success has come at the expense of duty of care. "I don't think anyone in sport doesn't want to see a healthy environment for athletes and all staff," said Grainger. "From what we've seen it will always need to improve… we are dealing with human beings, and unfortunately in recent months we've seen some awful stories coming to light and nobody wants to see that going on - and I think it is being addressed now. "I'd like as much out there as possible - I don't want to hear any more negative stories about the culture within sport, but if they exist I want them out on the table because they need to be addressed." UK Sport has promised a "root and branch review" of culture in high-performance programmes, and appointed a new head of integrity. When asked if the current controversies amounted to a crisis, Grainger said: "There's huge concerns about athlete welfare without a doubt, and I don't think anyone's pretending it's not, we have to address it. "For me, it's not about coming and blaming sports, because if there's flaws in the system we have to know how they got there, how do they become avoidable, and it's about learning from any mistakes that have been made," said Grainger. "Whatever the reasons behind it, these pressures and behaviours now exist and yes, of course we want to stamp them out - but in a way that they won't rise again. "So if it's a slight shift in education, or understanding what's being asked of people, or the fact that it's not 'win at all costs', then that messaging needs to go out. "I really want to spend some time with all the sports finding out what challenges they face. And it is a different world we live in now - there are certainly financial pressures on everyone, and has that brought in extra stresses that we may not have predicted 10 years ago?" A recent report into claims of bullying at British Cycling, one of the country's most successful and best-funded governing bodies, found a lack of good governance, heard there was "a culture of fear" and criticised UK Sport for missing crucial warning signs. Grainger said she was "massively disappointed" by the report. "It's awful to see what some of the athletes and staff have had to go through. None of us would want to see anything like that again. Unfortunately it's happened. "The scale of it took everyone by surprise. UK Sport has admitted there's things that could have been done differently." The report was commissioned last year after allegations made by ex-Great Britain cyclist Jess Varnish and Grainger says she would be happy to meet the former sprinter. "I think everybody would have sympathy with her own situation. You would not want any athlete to go through what she's been through, but I think there has been a lot of change, and as uncomfortable it has been for a lot of people around the sport, it probably has brought change in for the better." Recommendations aimed at improving athlete welfare have been published by 11-time Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, including a Sports Ombudsman, and a beefed-up British Athletes Commission. "She has some fantastic ideas," said Grainger. "At the moment most athletes, if they were in really dire straights, wouldn't always know where to go. That's what I do think we are missing." When asked if athletes need more employee rights and protection included in their contracts with governing bodies, Grainger said: "You want athletes to feel very protected - but also you want a healthy environment. "What I don't want is for battle lines to be drawn between sports and their athletes. If things need to change they absolutely should change for the better."	Dame Katherine Grainger, the incoming chair of UK Sport, says she has "huge concerns about athlete welfare".
The government said any decision should await a report being written by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones. Andy Burnham, who called for the law, criticised the failure to include it in the Policing and Crime Bill. He said it was wrong Margaret Aspinall had to use compensation for her son's death towards the "fight for justice". The shadow home secretary said Ms Aspinall, whose son James died in the 1989 disaster, had to put the Â£1,000 she received in compensation towards legal fees and was then "living on the breadline" trying to cover the cost of fighting for justice. The Leigh MP said the 27-year fight Hillsborough families had to endure showed how the odds were stacked against families seeking the truth. It has been revealed South Yorkshire Police spent at least Â£2.1m on legal fees representing its suspended Chief Constable David Crompton during the inquests into the deaths of the 96 fans who were killed. The Labour MP said: "This Bill was an opportunity to make this country fairer, to even up the scales and tip them in favour of ordinary families and away from the establishment. "I fear we have failed to do that." He said Ms Aspinall, who is chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, watched the debate from the public gallery, and was "disappointed" by the government's refusal to accept equal legal funding in to the Bill. The Policing and Crime Bill gives police stronger powers and hands responsibility for fire and rescue services to elected police and crime commissioners. It creates so-called super complaints which will allow organisations like charities to bring a large-scale complaint against the police and strengthens protections for whistleblowers so identities are protected while investigations are conducted. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Bill would allow police to go "further and faster" and "radically reform" the complaints and disciplinary systems. However, Mr Burnham said it was a "mixed bag" that included improvements but also missed opportunities including the equal legal funding for victims as well as a second Leveson Inquiry into the relationship between police and the press. The Bill will now pass to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. In April, jurors ruled the 96 victims of Hillsborough were unlawfully killed. The Rt Rev James Jones, the former Bishop of Liverpool, led the Hillsborough Independent Panel now acts as the home secretary's adviser on Hillsborough.	A decision on a "Hillsborough Law" to ensure legal funding for bereaved families at inquests where police are involved has been put on hold.
The four-match contest should have begun in Brisbane on Thursday, but that Test will now start on 17 December. The traditional Melbourne Boxing Day Test is unchanged, but the Sydney Test is put back three days to 6 January. The changes have been made because of welfare concerns for Australia's players grieving for Hughes, 25, whose funeral will take place on Wednesday. The left-handed Australia opener died on Thursday after being struck on the neck by a ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield match. The funeral service will take place in the sports hall of Macksville High School, which Hughes attended, and will be broadcast live in Australia and on big screens at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Adelaide Oval. "Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland. "These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief. It's very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly. "While this wasn't done by design, it is somewhat fitting that the first Test will take place in Adelaide at Phillip's adopted home ground where we hope the match can be a seen as a celebration of his life." The India squad, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight. Their two-day warm-up match against a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide, scheduled for Friday and Saturday last week, was cancelled. It has been reported that the Indians may now play a tour game in Adelaide on Thursday and Friday. After the Test series with India, Australia then face the tourists in a triangular one-day international series that also involves England. Two of those games have already been switched. Australia and England will now open the series in Sydney on 16 January, with the Aussies taking on India in Melbourne two days later.	Australia's Test series with India will now begin in Adelaide on 9 December following the death of Phillip Hughes.
Speaking to 1Xtra's Semtex, the rapper said: "I'm not trying to tell people not to use it and I'm not saying that you should use it. "I'm just saying here's the information that I've gathered. "I've put it into five minutes, and I want you to take that information and go and research yourself." Swiss, who is best known for being part of So Solid Crew, added: "Gather the information and then make a decision on what you want to do with it." Before the show, Radio 1Xtra explained to Newsbeat that: "The track, which tackles the complex issues around the word, will be played in the late-night specialist show with full warnings ahead of its play and an appropriate introduction giving context to the song. "The decision to play the track is based on musical merit and it is in line with audience expectations." Before playing the five-minute track in full during his 22:00 - 01:00 show, Semtex reflected the mixed response the track has had online. He said: "In case you haven't heard it this is a track that stopped the internet this week. "It didn't break the internet it stopped the internet. "It stopped everybody to put down what they were doing and think about what this guy was saying on the track. "Some people got offended, some people were like 'I'm glad somebody said that', other people were educated." The track opens with a series of samples referencing black slavery, including quotes from Django Unchained and references several cases of when the media has reported the term being used in a negative way. A sequence of lyrics, which ends with the song's title, reiterate the point Swiss made during the interview. "It can be a term of endearment or an emotional trigger. "It can be the difference between jovial and bitter. It depends on how it's presented, said, spoken delivered. But the expression presents a social dilemma. "Everybody should understand the historical picture before we ever choose to use the word nigger." After the track was played a clip of Professor Randall Kennedy Harvard University, who teaches a course on race relations, explained the thought that some rappers put into their use of the N-word. He said: "With hip-hop there have been some who have put great store on the spelling... because that differentiates from [the traditional spelling] which has principally been used a as racial slur." Following the clip Semtex added: "I think in hip-hop it's confusing" before playing a Y.G track and referring to a Rick Ross song which both contain heavy use of the word. He asked Swiss if hip-hop is at fault for using the word, even when it's seemingly used in an endearing way. "I don't think hip-hop's at fault," replied the rapper. "A lot of negative things are celebrated in our society. "I think the word's got a strange journey. "The way our language works if that it can change over time. "It has no sort of loyalty to any gender, any race or any time period. Words can change and this is an example." He explained that during his research he found that some people the word comes from the Latin word negro before being used in the slave trade, while others believe it was first used in Ethiopia as a term for a king. "When you speak about people using it today who are ignorant from where it comes from... I don't think you can just put the blame of hip-hop." Semtex then suggested that tracks like Kanye West and Jay Z's In Paris are sustaining the term and referred to a show at the O2 when Kanye announced that white people in the audience could use the term during the song, which they played a number of times. "Does he have the right? Does any black person have the right to say you can use it?" he asked. Swiss replied: "I think if you accept that they have - then they have. It's down to you. "If you choose not to use it based on your own conviction then you're standing on your own two [feet]." Sky, who produced the track, added: "It doesn't matter if someone gave you the right. It's how you feel about it. You've got to educate yourself and make your own decision. "I want people to think about how they use it and how it affects the mood of people about them." Swiss has made a documentary to accompany the track, which has the same name. The trailer sees artists including Wretch 32, Fuse ODG, Akala, Ms Dynamite and SBTV founder Jamal Edwards discussing what the word means to them. Semtex went on to ask if the rapper ever uses the word himself. "Until the So Solid concert [at London's O2 in 2013] came up and I had to perform lyrics... which have the word in it... I always blocked it out i didn't use it. I put brother there [instead]. "But when the So Solid concert came up, when I was rehearsing and performing it with the guys I just felt like I needed to use it because that's the word that I used at that time. "So within the context of that song, in order to have the same passion and integrity I felt like I should use it." They discussed how some people outside of black communities, including Latin and white communities, now regularly use the word before Semtex asked why Swiss had released the song now and if it was a case of society having to "examine this issue". "I had the idea years ago," said the rapper. "I was invited to Cambridge University recently... the invite rekindled the idea because basically they asked me to come there and have a round table debate about the word itself. "I gathered all the information, started researching and due to unforeseen circumstances I couldn't actually attend." He explained he was working on some new music with Sky at the time. "We made a few tracks but there was nothing that was that hard-hitting thing. Obviously I had the N-word idea in my head." Nas released an album in 2008 which was untitled but it's widely understood that he had planned to use the N-word as the title before changing his mind before release because of controversy surrounding the term. Swiss said that he had seem some negative feedback online about the title of the track online but that he wasn't too bothered about it. "I use the word in its entirety because when you use the word it hits home. I feel like the word does need to be used properly." Sky added: "It's not a race debate. It's about the word." Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.	Swiss has said the aim of his new track is for people to educate themselves about the use of the N-word, rather than trying to stop them using it.
The database is reported to contain information on 100,000 US Department of Defense employees, among others. Troy Hunt, who published news of the leak, said the information had "enormous" potential for scammers. Business services firm Dun & Bradstreet confirmed to tech news site ZDNet that it owns the data. Information on government departments and private sector employees is commonly collated by business services that sell the data to other companies, such as marketing firms. In this case, the records - including names, job titles and contact details - were originally compiled by NetProspex, which was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015. Organisations with employees mentioned in the data include the US Postal Service, telecoms giant AT&T and the retailer Walmart. Mr Hunt pointed out that people might try to use the names and email addresses in the database to scam or retrieve sensitive information from recipients - a practice known as spear phishing. "The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation," he wrote on his blog. Dun & Bradstreet told ZDNet: "Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system." The leak is the latest in a long string of personal data caches dumped online. In January, personal information of health workers in the US Army was found online by another security professional.	Details of more than 33 million US employees - including military staff - have been released online, according to a security researcher.
Mohammed Siddique, 60, and his son Mohammed Waqar, 24, admitted wilful cruelty to a child under 16. The four attacks took place at the Jamia Mosque in Sparkbrook, Birmingham, between May and June 2014, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The pair, from the Tyseley area of the city, also face a teaching ban. Sam Forsyth, prosecuting, said the victim was beaten with a plastic stick and given back-of-the-hand slaps by each of his tutors for "talking in the classroom" at a Birmingham Islamic centre. The boy was hit during four separate incidents, with photographs of his injuries showing "extensive" bruising to the back of his legs. Miss Forsyth said the boy had been left distressed by the experience. He told police "Waqar would call him names like 'paedo'," in the classroom, Miss Forsyth added. "He describes how this has had a great effect on him, causing him to lose hair as he was getting very stressed," she said. "When he was bruised he would try and hide them with clothing even in very hot weather and make excuses not to go to the centre, such as having tummy ache." Charanjit Jutla, defending, said both defendants were men of previous good character and deeply regretted their conduct. Judge Mark Wall QC told them: "These were not assaults committed in ignorance of how inappropriate it was to use corporal punishment such as this." He added: "Acts of brutality of this sort which you each indulged in, with a stick, will not be tolerated."	Two Islamic school teachers who beat a 10-year-old boy with a stick for reciting the Koran incorrectly have been jailed for a year.
Sirigu, who spent last season on loan in Spain with Sevilla and Osasuna, moves on a free transfer after ending his PSG contract by mutual consent. England international Joe Hart was Torino's first-choice keeper last season, but has returned to Manchester City after completing a loan spell. "The club and the president made me feel important and I thank them for that," said Sirigu, 30. Sirigu, capped 17 times by Italy, joined PSG from Palermo in 2011, but lost his place to Kevin Trapp at the start of the 2015-16 season.	Torino have signed Italy goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu from Paris St-Germain.
Shunsuke Mutai, the vice-minister of reconstruction, was visiting the town of Iwaizumi to assess the deadly damage caused by Typhoon Lionrock. The storm killed more than 20 people in the region. But he was seen on TV laughingly being piggybacked by a less senior official, so he could keep his feet dry. Mr Mutai, who apparently forgot to take rubber boots with him, later apologised, saying what he did was "inappropriate" and that he "deeply regretted it". The picture went viral on social media with netizens lambasting the vice-minister and accusing him of not taking his job seriously. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later criticised Mr Mutai for lacking sensitivity. "He went there as head of the government investigation team, so naturally he should have brought his rubber boots to begin with. "I must say he lacked sensitivity to the residents and the region," he said.	A Japanese senior government official has come under criticism for hitching a ride on a colleague's back to cross a puddle.
Bahman Daroshafaei, who has dual British and Iranian citizenship, was arrested at his home in Tehran on 3 February on unspecified charges. One friend told the Reuters news agency that his release on Tuesday "was a surprise to him". Mr Daroshafaei has been working as a translator since leaving BBC Persian around two years ago. His family said that his passport had been seized after he returned to Iran. Since then, he had been questioned dozens of times by the intelligence ministry about his activities as a journalist, the news website Iranwire reported. A Twitter campaign run by his friends and colleagues, @FreeBahman, posted a photograph of Mr Daroshafaei standing outside Tehran's Evin prison on Tuesday. "Good news: Bahman has been released on bail," said the caption. In November, two prominent journalists were arrested as part of what appeared to be a crackdown on writers, artists and other cultural figures in Iran. Isa Saharkhiz and Ehsun Mazandarani have been accused of acting against national security. The previous month, poets Fatemeh Ekhtesari and Mehdi Mousavi and filmmaker Keywan Karimi were handed lengthy prison terms by a court after being convicted of charges including "insulting sanctities and propaganda against the state".	A former BBC Persian journalist detained in Iran has been released from prison on bail, his friends say.
Mr Davies is widely known as Welsh Conservative leader but his authority does not extend beyond the assembly Tory group, under party rules. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Wales, the AM admitted the Welsh party lacked clear leadership. The Tories lost three seats in Wales at the general election, leaving them with eight. It lost both of the seats it gained at the 2015 general election from Labour - Gower and the Vale of Clwyd - and also lost Cardiff North. When it was put to him that there was a lack of clear leadership in the Tory campaign in Wales, Mr Davies said: "I agree with you entirely. "We have a very strong distinct Welsh Conservative brand, but we do need to be able to make key political decisions here in Wales and have a designated leader here in Wales, similar to what Labour formalised back in March. I readily acknowledge that. "I lead on devolution, on secretary of state aspects such as Westminster, obviously the secretary of state leads then. The chairman of the voluntary party obviously leads on the voluntary party... That cannot continue." Mr Davies said he thought Scotland "had a very good model which has shown to be successful". There, Ruth Davidson led a separate campaign to the Conservatives in England and Wales, largely focused and opposed to the SNP's calls for a second independence referendum. The party gained 12 seats in Scotland, finishing with 13. "There is a deficiency in the ability to make those key decisions from a party perspective and I do acknowledge that," said Mr Davies. But, he added: "Let's not forget, there's a huge job of work to be done as we go forward as a country. The Conservative Party is the largest party in Westminster and its incumbent we form a government." The Welsh Conservative campaign was marred by a row over who was meant to have represented the party in the BBC Wales Leaders' Debate. Neither Mr Davies or Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns took part - with senior AM Darren Millar taking the podium instead.	The Welsh Tories need a designated leader that can make key decisions for the party, Andrew RT Davies has said.
In the case of Baldock Town, that job has this season fallen to injured defender Liam Kenna. But his updates from the dugout during their FA Cup preliminary qualifying round tie against North Greenford United came to abrupt halt when he was sent on as a substitute with 10 minutes remaining. And the absence of his tweets prompted him to post an apology on behalf of the club the following day, which quickly went viral. "The secretary used to do it, but he left at the end of last season and because I have a bad back I've been doing it," the 29-year-old told BBC Sport. "I tweet every chance, every goal, every yellow card, I do it constantly." Kenna, from Llanelli, has not played this season because of his injury, but after only two or three light training sessions he was named among the substitutes. "There was a 90% chance I wasn't going to get on, but the centre-half got injured with 10 minutes left and we'd already used the other two subs," Kenna continued. "When I went to see the linesman to get my studs checked, I still had my phone in my hand. He said 'you can't go on with that mate'." The South Midlands League Division One side were 3-1 ahead when Kenna joined the action and held on to win by the same scoreline, but his lack of recent game-time took a physical toll. "I only touched the ball two or three times. I couldn't get round the pitch and couldn't breathe afterwards," he said. Former England striker Kevin Phillips and ex-Arsenal midfielder Ian Allinson both played for the original Baldock Town, which eventually folded in 2001. The current club was formed two years later and are now tenants at Arlesey's Town's Armadillo Stadium five miles away, having previously ground shared with Hitchin and Stotfold. Their reward for beating North Greenford is a home tie against Thame United of the Southern League over the weekend of the 9-10 September. And the FA have offered to do Baldock's tweeting for them so Kenna can concentrate on playing. He is no stranger to glory after captaining former club Welwyn Garden City to a league and cup double in 2014-15, but is doubtful about whether he will be match-fit. "I'm seeing a physio once a week privately, but it's more than likely I'm going to be on the bench again," he said. "But I'd better be careful because after Sunday's game, the manager fined me £10 for having my phone in the dugout."	Such is the reach of social media these days, even non-league football clubs provide their supporters with blow-by-blow updates via Twitter.
Wilson, 24, is the only addition to the 18 women who formed the first group to be given central contracts in 2014. The right-hander made her international debut in 2010 but has not represented England since 2011. "She thoroughly deserves to be awarded a central contract," said ECB director of women's cricket Clare Connor. "She scored significant runs throughout the summer and has been a dedicated member of the England women's performance squad during the past 18 months." Following defeat by Australia in the multi-format Ashes series earlier this year, England appointed Mark Robinson as head coach in November. The former Sussex coach's first series in charge will be against South Africa in February 2016, with three one-day internationals followed by three T20 Internationals. England will also take part in the 2016 World Twenty20 in India, overseas tours to West Indies and Sri Lanka and a home series against Pakistan in what Connor called "the busiest ever 12 months for England women". She added: "The awarding of central contracts ensures that the squad will be as best prepared and supported as possible for each of those contests." Full list of centrally contracted professionals: Charlotte Edwards (capt), Tammy Beaumont, Katherine Brunt, Kathryn Cross, Georgia Elwiss, Natasha Farrant, Lydia Greenway, Rebecca Grundy, Jenny Gunn, Danielle Hazell, Amy Jones, Heather Knight, Laura Marsh, Natalie Sciver, Anya Shrubsole, Sarah Taylor, Lauren Winfield, Fran Wilson, Danielle Wyatt	Middlesex batter Fran Wilson has been awarded a central contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board for 2016-17.
Cheick Cisse, who won taekwondo gold, was given $85,000 (??64,000) and Ruth Gbagbi, who won bronze in the women's event, got $51,000. Cisse's gold medal was the first in the country's history. Last year, President Alassane Ouattara made similar awards to members of the national football team after they won the African Cup of Nations. He did not reveal any details about the houses given to Cisse and Gbagbi, or their location. More on this and other African stories Mr Ouattara and his wife Dominique wore the medals as they posed with the athletes for photos at the presidential palace in the country's commercial capital, Abidjan. Ivory Coast had only won one Olympic medal until this year. Gabriel  Tiacoh won a silver medal in the men's 400m in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. He died in 1992. Ivory Coast used to be one of Africa's richest countries but its economy has been devastated by years of conflict.	Ivory Coast's two medallists from the Rio Olympic games have been given cash awards and houses by the president.
The existing Langlands School building, which is based at Loreburn Park, is in a poor condition, according to the education department. They have proposed moving it to a new joint campus serving the north-west of the town. It is part of a wider scheme known as a the Dumfries Learning Town project. According to a report to Dumfries and Galloway Council's education committee, the school for secondary age pupils would be known as New Langlands School. It would be part of a campus at Alloway Road which would also incorporate Maxwelltown High School, and Lochside and St Ninian's primaries. Officers have recommended a formal consultation on the plan. They said parents and staff have reacted positively to the proposal during initial informal discussions.	A Dumfries school for children with severe and complex needs could be relocated to a new "learning campus" under new council plans.
The initiative returns from 19-25 June ahead of a busy summer of elite sport which includes the cricket and rugby World Cups in the UK and Ireland. The European Football Championship starts in July in the Netherlands. The campaign will encourage the public to watch, listen, volunteer and take part in sporting activities. Crouch added: "We want more women and girls to get involved in sport and enjoy the huge benefits that being active brings to their lives." Shelley Alexander, editorial lead for women's sport for BBC Sport, said: "We'll devote even more resources to showcasing the best of women's sport across television, radio and online this year. "We'll also examine the pertinent issues across women's sport, with our original journalism interrogating the state of play of women and girls' sport from the grassroots to the elite."	Women's Sport Week will be "a fantastic campaign" and "encourage more women to try a new sport", says minister for sport Tracey Crouch.
Media playback is not supported on this device The victory means the Irish will face France in Sunday's final at the World League 2 tournament. Wales will also make the final qualifiers in Johannesburg if they beat Scotland in the third place play-off. Gareth Furlong put Wales ahead before Shane O'Donoghue, Ben Walker and Neal Glassey netted for the Irish. Ireland, 10th in the world rankings, were strong favourites to account for the 34th-ranked Welsh but the visitors produced a strong challenge. Furlong's early goal from a penalty corner left Wales ahead after the opening quarter but O'Donoghue and Walker struck in quick succession in the second quarter to give the hosts a half-time lead. Wales had a couple of chances in the third quarter - including a missed penalty corner - before Glassey sealed Ireland's win by netting early in the final quarter. France earned a 2-0 win over the Scots in Saturday's second semi-final.	Ireland's men guaranteed themselves a spot at the final World Cup qualifying tournament in the summer by beating Wales 3-1 at Stormont on Saturday.
Australian Browne stopped defending champion Ruslan Chagaev to win the title in Russia earlier this month. The 36-year-old delivered a positive sample for clenbuterol after the fight, his management company have revealed. "I would like to assure all fans, the whole of the boxing world and all of Australia that I am not a drug user or a drug cheat," said Browne. Sydney-born Browne was knocked down in the sixth round but floored Uzbekistan's Chagaev with a big right to improves his record to 24-0. He added: "I will fight for as long as it takes to clear my name. I have never heard of the drug clenbuterol and had no idea what it is used for. "I am now aware that it is essentially a weight-stripping drug and as a heavyweight boxer, the idea of me using it is utterly ridiculous. "My team and I were well aware of the many risks involved in going to a place like Chechnya to fight a reigning champion and believed we had taken sufficient precautions. "In addition, it was at our insistence that Vada [Voluntary Anti-Doping Association] testing was implemented for the fight." Clenbuterol is a powerful drug used to treat asthma, but it can also help build up lean muscle mass and burn off fat. The drug's growth-promoting ability has also found favour with beef farmers, particularly in China and Mexico. The fact that humans can ingest the substance inadvertently by eating beef has in the past put pressure on anti-doping rules, which deem the slightest trace to be a doping infringement.	WBA heavyweight champion Lucas Browne says he is "shocked and devastated" after failing a drugs test.
Southgate effectively used a three-man defence in the 1-0 friendly loss in Germany on Wednesday. It is the same system used to good effect by Premier League leaders Chelsea and Italian champions Juventus. "If he [Southgate] feels that's the right way to go, I think it's a really good way of playing," former England player Scholes told BBC's Sportsweek. "Over the past few years we seem to copy whoever is doing well, whether it's Spain or Germany. There was a spell when academies were copying what even Belgium were trying to do. "I think it's about time now that Gareth and his staff brought an identity to English football and the national team that we can be proud of. "It's going to be difficult and it will take a little bit of time, but if he's playing this way and England are being successful then that's what it's all about." Media playback is not supported on this device England's defeat in Germany was their first in four games under Southgate, who was made permanent boss last November after having taken over on a temporary basis following the departure of Sam Allardyce. Southgate, who represented England as a player, was previously manager of the under-21 side, after having led Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2009. "I really liked Gareth when I played with him," said Scholes. "He was good with the young lads... he's been successful with England which not many players have been, getting to the semi-finals of Euro 96." Scholes said that Southgate maybe hadn't fully "earned his stripes" at domestic club or European level, but added: "We've been down the route of so-called super coaches who haven't worked. "Now we've got a passionate man in charge, he likes to play young players which is good," added the ex-Manchester United midfielder. "Hopefully the future is bright under him." In Germany, England were without captain Wayne Rooney, who will also be missing for the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Lithuania on Sunday as he recovers from a leg injury. The 31-year-old has struggled to claim a starting place for Manchester United this season but former team-mate Scholes still feels he has "a part to play" for both club and country. "He's got great experience and he can pass knowledge on to young players," said Scholes. Rooney has been linked with a return to his first club Everton this summer, but Scholes believes staying and reclaiming his place in the United side would aid his England chances. "I don't want him to go to another English club, I hope he gets back in the United team," he added. "If he gets back in the United team then he is straight back into the England side."	England boss Gareth Southgate must establish an identity for the national side, says Paul Scholes.
The change, introduced on 1 May, means google.ps now displays "Palestine" in Arabic and English under Google's logo. Using the word Palestine is controversial for some. Israeli policy is that the borders of a Palestinian state are yet to be agreed. In November, the UN gave Palestine the status of "non-member observer state". The decision by the General Assembly was strongly opposed by Israel and the United States. Previously, Palestine only had "observer entity" status. It followed an unsuccessful Palestinian bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council. Palestinians in general seek recognition for the state they are trying to establish and the adoption of the name Palestine. Israel considers any formal use of the word Palestine as pre-judging the outcome of currently stalled peace talks. In much of Israel's official terminology the West Bank is referred to as Judea and Samaria. In a statement given to the BBC on Friday, Google spokesman Nathan Tyler said: "We're changing the name 'Palestinian Territories' to 'Palestine' across our products. We consult a number of sources and authorities when naming countries. "In this case, we are following the lead of the UN, Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers], ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] and other international organisations." The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed Google's decision. "This is a step in the right direction, a timely step and one that encourages others to join in and give the right definition and name for Palestine instead of Palestinian territories," Dr Sabri Saidam, advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told the BBC. "Most of the traffic that happens now happens in the virtual world and this means putting Palestine on the virtual map as well as on the geographic maps," he added. Dr Saidam said that since the UN vote on 29 November, the PA had written to international companies, including Google, asking them to replace their usage of "Palestinian Territories" with "Palestine".	Internet giant Google has changed the tagline on the homepage of its Palestinian edition from "Palestinian Territories" to "Palestine".
Media playback is not supported on this device Irishwoman Taylor, bidding to win a sixth consecutive World title, lost a split decision against France's Estelle Mossely in Kazakhstan. Taylor, 29, was given all four rounds by one judge but the other two judges handed Mossely a countback victory. The Bray fighter takes bronze but does secure Rio Olympics qualification. Taylor's domination of the 60kg division was dented last month by a unanimous points defeat by  Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Turkey. The Irish boxer hadn't lost a fight at the world championships since 2005 when she was defeated by North Korea's Kang Kum-Hui in the quarter-finals. The judging appeared decidedly confusing during Thursday's contest with Taylor given the third round on all three cards despite the Frenchwoman appearing to dominate the round. Taylor then appeared to edge the final round only for two of the judges to plump for Mossely. That left Taylor a 40-36 winner on one of the cards while the two judges that marked the contest 38-38 gave Mossely a countback victory. The Irishwoman had beaten Mossely in their three previous contests. Irish light-welterweight Kellie Harrington is through to the final of the World Championships after an emphatic semi-final victory over Canada's Sara Cali in Kazakhstan. The Dublin fighter is guaranteed at least a silver medal ahead of Friday's final against China's Wenlu Yang in the non-Olympic weight.	London 2012 gold medallist Katie Taylor suffered a second defeat in six weeks as she was beaten in the World Championship lightweight semi-finals.
The corruption allegations came in a video by opposition campaigner Alexei Navalny, viewed by millions on YouTube. Mr Medvedev's properties include a vineyard in Italy, a mountain villa, and two luxury yachts, it is alleged. "They pick up any old tosh, nonsense, about me or my acquaintances, and people I've never heard of," he said. It is the first time he has commented on the claims published by Mr Navalny's anti-corruption network on 2 March. Mr Navalny said the prime minister profited from a complex business network which concealed "bribes" by using offshore schemes and charity foundations. The claims stirred up mass protests which saw thousands of Russians march against the government in several cities on 26 March. Hundreds of demonstrators were detained, many of them young supporters of Mr Navalny. The following day a court jailed Mr Navalny for 15 days for disobeying a police officer. Mr Medvedev said the "provocative" video was "expensively produced - financed by private sponsors" and "aimed at achieving a specific political result". "They lure young people via social media, and those youths come out with certain slogans, unfortunately in violation of the law. In essence, they expose them to the machinery of law enforcement, and those youths suffer as a result." He was speaking to workers at a bacon factory in the Tambov region, south of Moscow. Mr Navalny - a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin associates - plans to run for the Russian presidency next year. Mr Medvedev said he had "strong nerves" which protected him from such attacks. "If I reacted each time to such attacks I simply wouldn't manage to get on with my job as normal."	Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has dismissed as "nonsense" allegations that he has secretly accumulated a vast fortune including country estates.
It has told AMs that almost 40,000 hours were "lost" in 2014 because of so-called "handover delays". Its report indicates that is up from around 8,000 hours lost in 2008. The ambulance service's chairman also said its "long-standing and complex problems" were now being tackled. He was giving evidence to the assembly's health committee, as it began a short inquiry into the performance of the ambulance services in Wales in the light of recent concerns about its performance. Any wait longer than 15 minutes to transfer patients into hospital is logged as a handover delay, often caused when emergency unit beds are full. The ambulance service says the delays not only present "risks to patients waiting in vehicles" but are "arguably a greater risk" to patients "in the community". That is because when crews are tied up outside A&E they are not able to respond to other urgent calls, which can mean no ambulances are available. Research by the BBC also suggests the ambulance service in Wales, during a four-month period last autumn, faced consistently longer delays than anywhere in England or Northern Ireland. Between August and November last year the Welsh Ambulance Service reported the longest "average handover time" for 13 weeks of a 16-week period. In 10 weeks out of the 16, the Welsh Ambulance Service also had  the longest single delay of any recorded by the 11 ambulance services that provided information. The maximum recorded wait for an ambulance patient in Wales exceeded five hours in three of the weeks. Those delays occurred at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The report to the assembly's health committee suggests handover delays are contributing to problems the ambulance service is encountering in its response time performance. The most recent statistics published last week showed that only 48.5% of urgent Category A calls received a response within eight minutes in January. The target is 65%. But other factors, the evidence suggests, are at play: Addressing the committee, ambulance service chairman Mick Giannasi listed actions being taken to overcome "long-standing and complex problems", including a "significant" improvement to industrial relations with staff. "We absolutely acknowledge that the performance of the emergency ambulance service in Wales is not acceptable, particularly not in terms of its achievement against the eight-minute response times target," he said. "We accept progress is slow, but we passionately believe now that I think our plans will deliver," he added. Meanwhile, the author of a review into the ambulance service said improvements were taking longer than she wanted. Prof Siobahn McClelland called for major changes when she published her findings, commissioned by the Welsh government, in 2013. She said some of her recommendations were being introduced in an NHS that was a  "very complex organisation that is sometimes very slow to change". Before the committee meeting, a Welsh government official commented: "We expect all patient handovers to be completed in order of clinical priority and in a timely manner. "Health boards should take responsibility for reducing lengthy patient handover delays. We continue to monitor the situation closely."	Patients could be at risk because there's been a five-fold increase in delays faced by ambulance crews outside hospitals, according to the Welsh Ambulance Service.
The Xylella fastidiosa bacteria also threatens citrus fruit and vineyards. The Commission says at least 10% of the 11 million olive trees in Lecce are infected. It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain "a lot of uncertainties" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January. "Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough," he said. Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica. The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year. It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause. Peacelink urged the EU not to destroy olive trees en masse in the affected area, saying such a move would be "totally unnecessary".	Italy must step up efforts to contain a bacterial disease blighting olive trees in the southern province of Lecce, the European Commission has warned.
The decision to call off the fixture was made following a morning pitch inspection and the game has been rescheduled for Tuesday, 15 December. Carrick's planned league game with Dungannon on that date will be moved. The other semi-final between Larne and Ballymena United goes ahead after the pitch passed a lunchtime inspection. Carrick have had three home Premiership games postponed in recent weeks - their league fixture against Dungannon Swifts has been called off twice. Gary Haveron's side were also forced to postpone their match against Cliftonville on Saturday because of a waterlogged pitch. Larne will be out to cause an upset against the Sky Blues at Inver Park. "We know we are nowhere near winning the league so it's important to compete for other silverware," said Ballymena manager Glenn Ferguson ahead of the trip to their County Antrim rivals. "We want to reach as many cup semi-finals and finals as we can." "We played Larne in pre-season so that gives us some idea what to expect. It will be a tough match as all the teams near the top of the Championship are capable of giving the senior teams a game," he added. The Sky Blues progressed to the last four by beating league champions and leaders Crusaders 2-0 at Seaview, courtesy of goals from David Cushley and Tony Kane. Their opponents lie third in Championship One after a 4-4 draw with Armagh City on Saturday. David McAlinden's side saw off Ards 2-1 to reach the semi-finals and will take heart from their League Cup performance against Portadown earlier in the season, taking the Premiership outfit to extra-time before losing 4-1. There will be coverage of Larne v Ballymena United on a Sportsound Special on BBC Radio Ulster medium wave and the BBC Sport website on Tuesday night from 19:30 GMT.	Tuesday night's Co Antrim Shield semi-final between Carrick Rangers and Linfield has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.
Jo Meeke and Matt Gurney's son Puck died in hospital following complications in labour. They have set up an appeal to create an outdoor space for other grieving families and hospital staff. Ms Meeke, from Bosham in West Sussex, said she hoped the woodland would help people on the "long journey" of coping with the death of a child. She had an "uncomplicated dream pregnancy" but after complications in labour, Puck was born via emergency Caesarean section on 15 March. He was transferred from St Richard's Hospital in Chichester to Southampton General Hospital's neonatal ward, where he died the following day. When it became clear he would not survive, the couple had 30 minutes to say goodbye. Ms Meeke said the time together had been "a special moment that will live with us forever". "The hardest thing we're having to deal with now is the immediate raw grief of looking at photos of our son, knowing we're not going to hold that little boy," she said. "But it's all the other things we had planned for our family moving on - suddenly those things are not going to happen." The couple has set up the Puck's Promise appeal and aim to crowd-fund £65,000 to buy the woodland. Mr Gurney said he hoped it would bring "something positive" out of their experience. "I'd primarily like families who have lost children in some way to be able to use it, for a walk or overnight camp, to be with other people who have been though the same thing."	A couple who lost their newborn baby have raised more than £12,000 towards buying an area of woodland in his name.
The grey and white mammal became stuck on sandbanks on Thursday at Saltney Ferry, near Chester. An RNLI lifeboat hoisted the dolphin out of the water before carrying it out to sea, according to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue. The dolphin, in the river since Monday, will be taken three miles off the coast of Rhyl. Alan Forrester, lifeboat operations manager with Flint RNLI, told Radio Wales the rescue boat was launched at Connah's Quay after the dolphin was seen "floundering" on a sandbank. It was hoisted onto the lifeboat and carried down the river towards open water. An animal welfare officer is also onboard. "We've got what we call an ambulance pouch, which is a rolled up stretcher," Mr Forrester added. "They laid that on the sandbank and rolled the dolphin into the stretcher and lifted it into the lifeboat. "It's rather a large dolphin. It's lying there nicely, they've got buckets of water to keep it cool - everything seems to be ok at the moment." The mammal was originally spotted by the public on Monday in Connah's Quay docks and became stranded briefly on Tuesday after turning to make its way to Flint and towards the sea. Liverpool coastguard wanted to hold off a rescue attempt for as long as possible to avoid coming into physical contact with the mammal in case it is rejected back at sea. A coastguard team was earlier deployed to the area to try to ensure the safety of spectators trying to catch a glimpse of the dolphin. It is thought the dolphin swam up the river during the high spring tide. It is rare for dolphins to be seen in the River Dee but a pair of porpoises were reported near  Queensferry Bridge eight years ago.	A dolphin has been rescued after swimming miles up the River Dee in Flintshire four days ago.
The offence referred to Aki's behaviour to and remarks directed toward referee Ian Davies during and after Connacht's defeat by Leinster on 15 April. The 27-year-old will miss his side's remaining Pro12 games of the regular season against Scarlets and Munster. Aki will also sit out Connacht's Champions Cup play-off match on the weekend of 19-21 May. The Kiwi can return to play from Monday, 22 May so he would be available to return for the following week's play-off final should Pat Lam's side progress. Aki faced a two-man disciplinary panel on Thursday via video link after a misconduct complaint was made against him by the disciplinary officer of Pro12 Rugby. He received a warning about his behaviour from Davies in the 76th minute of the 37-24 loss in the interprovincial derby and then further remonstrated with the Welsh referee after full-time. If Connacht remain in eighth place in the Pro12, they will face the English Premiership's seventh-placed team. If they were to win that game, as it stands, they would face the winner of the encounter between the seventh-placed Top 14 side and Cardiff Blues for a place in Europe's premier club competition next season. Aki will become eligible to play for Ireland under the three-year residency rule in October 2017.	Connacht centre Bundee Aki has been banned for three matches after admitting a charge of misconduct.
Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union drivers walked out on the Central and Waterloo and City lines in protest over the displacement of staff. A reduced service is running on the Central Line, but there is a good service on the Waterloo and City line. Other London Underground services are running as normal although commuters have been warned they could be busier. The strike began at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. The dispute centres around plans to transfer eight train operators between Central line depots. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "If [London Underground] are allowed to get away with this move on the Central Line they will start shunting drivers around at the drop of a hat regardless of the consequences." Peter McNaught, operations director for the Central line, said: "We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute."	A 24-hour strike on two London Underground lines is causing disruption to commuters.
He says there was no talk of heroics in the songs the soldiers were singing in the trenches or in the music halls back in Blighty. "Another surprise was that there were very few songs with any animosity towards the Germans, who they were fighting," says McCalman. "It was quite unbelievable that the wrath of the soldiers was directed at their own Command." Last week, England's education secretary Michael Gove sparked a heated debate when he hit out at "left-wing academics" and TV comedies and dramas which had led people to view the conflict as a "misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite". McCalman, whose show Far Far From Ypres will be performed at Celtic Connections later, says the theme of disillusionment with their situation and their commanders carries through all the songs, the poetry and the letters of the time. One song - Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire - asks why various army members are not to be found in the combat zone or anywhere near the trenches. The popular song has the quarter-master "miles and miles behind the line", the Sergeant-major is "stealing the privates' rum" and the Commissioned Officer is "down in a deep dug-out". The final line of the song asks, where are the "old battalion"? It answers poignantly: "They're hanging on the old barbed wire." It is a simple song, says McCalman, but one of the saddest in the show. Far Far From Ypres began life as an album of songs and poems from WW1, which were recorded by Scottish folk singers. McCalman, who says he is "not very proud" to admit that he knew very little about World War One or its songs before he began the project, was then inspired to write a narrative around the songs. It tells the story of Jimmy MacDonald who "comes from any village, town or city" in Scotland. Everyman Jimmy is full of enthusiasm and joins up as soon as he can, as so many did. Jimmy gets his basic training on Salisbury Plain before heading off to the trenches of Flanders field. The show, which is narrated by broadcaster Iain Anderson, features 28 of the finest singers from the Celtic Connections family, such as Barbara Dickson and Dick Gaughan. It will play out at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall against a backdrop of images from the war. It was such a success when first performed in 2012 that it has been brought back to the festival to mark 100 years since the start of the "war to end all wars". McCalman says the show is a labour of love for the performers, whom he jokes are "appearing for World War One wages". The songs, simple as many of them are, give a vivid insight into the attitudes and concerns of the troops in the trenches, he says. "They survived on bitter humour. They just had to grin and bear it. "The simplest song of the whole lot was called 'We are here because we're here'." This song just repeats its title over and over, betraying the trapped, futility of their situation. "There was nothing else, there were no other words that they could say. They were stuck there," McCalman says. Another song shows a surprising amount of solidarity with the German soldiers in the opposing trenches. 'Keep your head down Fritzie boy' has British troops in the trenches "up to their eyes in clay" when they spy a German "sticking up his snout". Remarkably the Tommies shout at their enemy, warning him he is going to get shot if he is not careful. Other songs such as Gassed last night bemoan the shortage of equipment, in this case respirators to survive the chemical gas attacks. The bitterness and disillusionment in the songs continues for those who survive the war. "I wore a tunic, a dirty khaki tunic" is about the perception that people who had not gone to the war had done much better by it. It contains the line "You were with the wenches/While we were in the trenches/Facing an angry foe". McCalman says despite the bitter tone of the songs they leave him, the singers and the audience with nothing but admiration for the sacrifices of the thousands of Scots who went to war. He says: "If I had been there I would have been shot in the back by the Sergeant major because I would have been the first to run. "So there is an element of hypocrisy in my admiration because I could never be as brave as they were."	The songs of World War 1 often speak of disillusionment, bitterness, boredom and a very dark sense of humour, says Scottish folk singer and producer Ian McCalman.
Paul Gallihawk, 34, failed to finish the initial swimming part of the race at Leybourne Lakes and was reported missing after he did not arrive to collect his bike for the cycling stage. The cause of his death remains unclear. His girlfriend Hayley said: "He was the most amazing and thoughtful partner. I loved him to bits and always will." "He was incredible in every way and he always put others before himself," she added. In a statement, the family said: "[Paul] had such a caring nature and will be sadly missed by all the family, extended family and friends. "Paul was a brilliant son and brother to Nick - he would do anything to help anyone and would always put them first." His friends also issued a statement: "Many of us have known Paul since we went to school together and we are all completely heartbroken. "He was a genuine and honest man - he was the funniest person in the world." The triathlon event was organised by Ocean Lake Triathlon, who said: "We are shocked by what happened." The triathlon club, based at Leybourne Lake Country Park and Simon Langton School in Canterbury, organises a series of six sprint distance races. Mr Gallihawk had been missing since a 750m swim at the start of the triathlon. He had written on his JustGiving page that he was competing to raise money for King's College Hospital in London, which had looked after his father. Since his disappearance was announced, donations on the page have risen to over Â£6,000. One donor wrote on the site: "Paul, you always had a smile and a laugh about everything, and a great teammate playing for Lenham. An absolute gent and our thoughts are with your loved ones."	Tributes have been paid to a triathlete whose body was found after he disappeared during a race near Maidstone on Saturday.
The Dragons have lost their last seven in the Pro12 while defending champions Gloucester have lost successive matches in the English Premiership. "It's a fresh challenge, we go there with nothing to lose and we'll play with no fear," said Jones. The Dragons reached the semi-final of the competition in 2015. Gloucester beat the Dragons 45-17 at Kingsholm in the Anglo-Welsh LV Cup semi-final in 2011, after losing 18-12 at Rodney Parade earlier in the campaign. The English side beat Edinburgh in the final of the 2015 Challenge Cup and won all their group matches on the way to the last eight in 2016. But Jones believes his team can rise to the challenge against a Gloucester side unbeaten in their last 15 in Europe despite the Dragons' poor form. "We've got a terrible record of the highest number of losing bonus points in the league, but we've done well in Europe," he said. "But they (Gloucester) are going to turn up on the back of four defeats as well. We understand that Gloucester will be favourites but we've got nothing to lose. "Last season we went to England for the first time and won a game of European rugby (at Newcastle), we went to France and won a game of European rugby (against Stade Francais), and this year we've been to France and won (at Castres). "So going away from home in European competition is not an issue for us." Dragons skipper T Rhys Thomas admits the squad have to take their share of responsibility for the recent slump in results. "It hasn't been where we want to be as a region but the players, we've had an honesty call amongst ourselves and taken a lot of ownership. We feel as though we've let everyone down," he revealed. Gloucester have experienced Wales internationals James Hook and Richard Hibbard in their squad as well as back-rower Ross Moriarty, who scored two tries for Wales against Italy. Dragons three-quarter Adam Hughes knows his side will have to close Hook down if they are to stand a chance of upsetting Gloucester. "He's very dangerous with ball in hand so you never know where he's going to pass or if he's going to go on his own. You've got to stay on him and his kicking game is really good."	Newport Gwent Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones says the region have "nothing to lose" in their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) provided no explanation for the missing funds, the auditor general told MPs. Oil revenue accounts for two-thirds of the government's funding. President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to crack down on corruption since coming to office last May. The NNPC has not commented on the auditor general's findings. This finding by the auditor general, while shocking, is not a surprise. Officials from the previous administration allegedly indulged in wholesale corruption where billions of dollars of oil funds simply disappeared. When the then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi pointed out that billions of dollars were missing from the treasury, he was sacked from his job. Nigeria's oil reserves should have been blessing for Nigeria to be used to build infrastructure and invest in social services. Instead, it has been a curse, a lubricant that has produced massive corruption and dysfunctional governments. President Buhari was elected on a platform of cleaning up the country's notoriously corrupt politics. But some officials from the previous administration accuse him of using corruption to pursue a political vendetta. The state oil giant has been mired in corruption allegations and losing money for many years. Last month, the government announced that the NNPC would be broken up into seven different companies. A separate audit ordered under former President Goodluck Jonathan and carried out by global accountancy firm PwC, found that the NNPC had failed to pay the government $1.48bn between January 2012 and July 2013. It did not provide a total figure for how much revenue the NNPC should legally have handed over to the treasury. However, the company said that it could not vouch for the integrity of the information it was given when it conducted the audit. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, but the economy has suffered because of the recent decline in the price of oil.	Nigeria's state-owned oil company has failed to pay the government $16bn (Â£11bn) in a suspected fraud, according to an official audit.
Media playback is not supported on this device You hope the call to abandon the match never has to be taken Referees' chief Mike Riley on racism A BBC Panorama programme highlighted racism incidents at grounds in Poland and Ukraine, who co-host Euro 2012. Manchester City and Italy striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off the pitch if he believed he was a victim. But Platini said: "It's a yellow card. It's not a player - Mr Balotelli - who's in charge of refereeing." Platini insists officials will deal with any racist incidents that occur during the tournament, which begins on Friday. "It's the referee who takes these decisions. Referees can finish the game. They have this power in case of racism," Platini told the BBC sports editor David Bond. "That is, I think, the best way to protect the game against racism. "The referee has been given advice and he can stop the game if there are problems." But both Premier League referees' chief Mike Riley and executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe, Piara Powar, say the situation should not arise. Piara said: "[Euro 2012 Respect ambassador Pierluigi] Collina was clear that if a player did approach a referee and was looking for help, that the referee would then facilitate the player leaving the field of play. "There would be no question of yellow or red cards being issued." Platini dismissed suggestions his reputation would be tarnished if there is racial abuse at Euro 2012. "Are you joking? You think I am responsible for the racists in the rest of Europe or in England or in France?" he said. Platini said Uefa had done a lot to tackle racisim, backing such initiatives as 'Never Again', but said he was "not responsible for society". He added: "Society is not so easy. You have some problems and we have to organise these Euros from the beginning with some problems because these two countries never welcome so big an event in the past. "Over the next month Ukraine and Poland will be in the spotlight in a way they have never encountered before. Should it go wrong then the reputation of Uefa and its ambitious French president will also be on the line." Read the rest of David's blog here "It was a big challenge for Poland, big challenge for Ukraine, a big challenge for Uefa, and we have done our best." Asked about the footage shown in Panorama's documentary, Platini said: "We are shocked about racists but we are trying to do something; we have to fight against that. "I feel bad. Of course I feel bad because I am not a racist." The 56-year-old former France international midfiedler also insisted the issue of racism is one that extends far beyond the two host nations of Euro 2012. Platini, who has been Uefa president since January 2007, said: "If you want to have a programme on racism you can go everywhere now because there is an increase in the nationalists in many, many countries. "It is not just a fact only in Poland and Ukraine. "You can go in France, United States, in England and you will find the problem of racism. "You have more nationalists in many, many countries in east of Europe - that is true." The Uefa president has previously criticised the host nations, describing Ukrainian hoteliers as "bandits" for the rising cost of accommodation and bemoaning the quality of pitches in Poland. The Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, has downplayed fears over racist attacks in Ukraine, saying hooligans were known to the authorities and security services "will be watching all the matches closely".	Uefa president Michel Platini says that any players who walk off the pitch at Euro 2012 due to racial abuse will be booked.
The full-back, 25, was hurt in Town's 3-1 defeat by Millwall on 9 April  - his first game since last December - and a scan has shown he needs surgery to repair ligaments. "It's disappointing - he's just got back into the side," assistant boss Mike Jackson told BBC Radio Shropshire. "Hopefully he'll get it sorted and be back playing as quickly as he can." Demetriou, who is out of contract in the summer, has made 50 appearances for Shrewsbury, scoring three goals, since joining from Kidderminster Harriers in June 2014. He spent the first half of this season on loan at Cambridge United and returned to the Shrews in January. Following last season's automatic promotion, Shrewsbury are trying to avoid an immediate return to League Two over their final six games. One point clear of the relegation zone, Town have a tough-looking start to their run-in with back-to-back home games against fourth-placed Bradford City and Sheffield United before trips to Gillingham, in sixth, and automatic-promotion chasers Walsall. Micky Mellon's side then finish with two games against mid-table sides - Peterborough, currently 14th and Swindon in 16th.	Shrewsbury Town defender Mickey Demetriou will miss the rest of the season because of a knee injury.
South Yorkshire Police hopes to build the 50-cell suite in Shepcote Lane, near to Meadowhall shopping centre. It will replace suites in Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Rotherham, saving more than £1m a year said the police. Ch Supt Rob Odell said it was hoped the new suite would be completed by the summer of 2016. He said: "We anticipate that replacing three existing properties within Rotherham and Sheffield with one purpose-built facility will deliver annual savings of approximately £1.2m. "The majority of this will come from a reduction in staffing, but there will be other revenue savings and energy efficiencies too. "We are consulting regularly with the staff affected, who are mainly custody sergeants and detention officers, and we hope to achieve the savings through natural wastage." A public consultation on the plans has begun.	Plans for a £19m police custody centre to replace three "outdated and inefficient" suites are being submitted to Sheffield City Council.

A Nepalese friend of Ryan Sean Davy said that the climber was being questioned by tourism officials. He is due to appear in court on Wednesday where he is expected to receive a heavy fine. Friends say Mr Davy has no cash, which is why he mostly travelled on foot. "He is in good heart although worried about his finances and the scale of the punishment he will receive," Mr Davy's Nepalese friend Mohan Gyawali told the BBC. US-based South African Mr Davy, 43, says he climbed alone to a height of 7,300m (24,000ft) before being found hiding in a cave by officials who confiscated his passport because he did not have a permit to climb Everest. He has apologised but complained of being treated harshly by officials. It is extremely rare for someone to attempt climbing Everest by themselves. The overwhelming majority of climbers only tackle the highest mountain in the world with the help of at least one guide and a well-equipped support team at base camp. "I have no idea of the outcome regarding my Everest no-permit climb," Mr Davy posted on Facebook on Tuesday Mr Gyawali said that the climber made his way back to Kathmandu using the same route from the base camp that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in 1953 when they became the first people to climb the mountain. The route goes through the small mid-hill town of Jiri. Nepal relies heavily on income generated from Everest expeditions and some believe the authorities will want to make an example out of Mr Davy to deter other climbers from dodging the permit fee. Mr Davy said on Facebook: "Expedition companies have no time for wannabe Everesters with no money so someone turned me in." The climber said he could expect to spend time in jail in addition to a fine of $22,000.	A man who tried to climb Everest in Nepal without paying the $11,000 permit fee has been arrested in Kathmandu after walking most of the 154km journey from the mountain's base camp.
A record 35.6 million tweets were sent during the 90-minute game. It also broke the tweets-per-minute record, when the fifth goal triggered 580,601 in one minute. Six of the 10 top-trending topics on Twitter were references to the match, with #BrazilvsGermany taking the top spot. Miroslav Klose was the most tweeted German player, followed by midfielder Toni Kroos. Julio Cesar, Oscar and Fred were the most tweeted Brazilian players. The previous record for a sporting event on Twitter was held by another World Cup match, Brazil v Chile, which recorded 389,000 tweets per minute. Previous to that the 2014 Superbowl held the record, with 382,000 tweets per minute. Many of the tweets took a wry look at the routing of Brazil, with some pointing out that Germany were scoring faster than they could type 140 characters. Tumblr pages dedicated to "sad Brazilians" sprang up during the game. Some faked images purporting to show Brazilians rioting were also posted. There were also plenty of Photoshopped images doing the rounds. Pictures of Rio de Janeiro's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue crying and taking off into space were popular, as were images of people drinking 7Up. A mock-up of Germany's goalkeeper sitting down and reading a book gained thousands of retweets.	Germany's 7-1 victory over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals has become the most discussed sports game on Twitter so far.
Black, who was convicted of murdering four young girls across the UK, died in Maghaberry prison last month. The detectives were in Northern Ireland last week to question Barry McCarney who is serving life for the murder of 15 month old Millie Martin in 2009. They questioned McCarney twice over three days, for four hours each time. After Black's death in January, McCarney told prison authorities that the paedophile had confessed several murders to him. Although Black was convicted of four child killings, he never admitted any of them. Timeline of Robert Black's killings The only crime which Black admitted to was the abduction of a girl in his native Scotland when he was caught red-handed. The BBC understands Black and McCarney became close while they were both housed in Maghaberry prison's hospital wing. Black is suspected of at least 12 other unsolved child murders, including that of Genette Tate in Devon in 1978. She disappeared while riding her bicycle on her newspaper round. Her body has never been found. Detectives from Devon and Cornwall Police were close to charging Black with her murder when he died. The force, however, has not confirmed if the detectives who visited McCarney came from there. Meanwhile, in a separate development, a former RUC detective who said he found the crucial piece of evidence which helped convict Black of Jennifer Cardy's murder has been speaking to the BBC. He said he found a petrol receipt which proved Black was less than a mile from Jennifer's house on the day she disappeared. That was 16 years before Black stood trial for Jennifer's murder and a delay which the former officer said was unacceptable. "We went to the headquarters at Shell at Worthenshaw and it was there we sat in the room with monitors and we were looking for Robert Black's signature coming up where he had got petrol. "Whenever we found the receipt that he was only less than a mile from McKee's Dam on the Hillsborough Road where he got petrol. "We were able to tie him down that he was in Northern Ireland at the time Jennifer Cardy went missing."	Claims that serial child killer Robert Black confessed several more killings to a prisoner in Northern Ireland are being examined by English police.
Mark Jennens, 40, was accused of manslaughter when his mother died after a row at their West Midlands home over Christmas dinner in 2015. The prosecution argued he threw her to the floor causing a fractured hip. But after a jury cleared him, he said: "For the first time in 18 months I can look myself in the eye in the mirror." Mr Jennens, of Brierley Hill, was the carer for his 78-year-old mother, who suffered from lung cancer. He admitted the pair had a difficult relationship. "She was a Jekyll and Hyde. She could be lovely or she could be evil, you never quite knew what you were getting," he told the BBC. Describing what happened on Christmas Eve, he said she fell after he picked her up by her arms in a "tragic accident" following their dispute. "My mother has been a difficult character and I'd been her sole carer for 10 years," he said. "She was being aggressive as per usual. Thousands of times she has been aggressive before. "And this one time I wanted to cry to be quite honest. So I went to pick her up to put her outside the door for two minutes so I could sit there and have a sob. "Well she went [fell] over and I phoned the police and ambulance." His mother was taken to Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, but later contracted pneumonia and died on 18 January 2016. Mr Jennens said he was "absolutely gobsmacked" after he was arrested shortly after. "Next thing you know I'm being done for manslaughter," he said. During his trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, it was reported the prosecution described what happened as "a cascade of events all led from a fractured hip which she suffered at her son's hands." But Mr Jennens' defence barrister argued there had been a "break in the chain of causation" when Hazel was incorrectly administered Salbutamol in hospital two days before she died. The jury cleared Mr Jennens in less than 90 minutes. "It was never prison that bothered me," he said. "No matter how difficult a relationship you've got with your mum you are always going to love them. "My mum had terminal lung cancer," he said, adding the family didn't know that his mother had been told a year before she died she had six months to live. He believes the case should never have been brought and that there were many gaps, including unanswered questions about her medical care. "Now the jury has come back unanimously after an hour-and-a-half it confirms there was no case to answer," he said. Mr Jennens said his family had "never doubted me for a second" and shared his relief. "I'm more relieved for my sisters because in hindsight I think they have suffered more than me," he said. He said he had been under enormous stress looking after his mother and has called for changes to aspects of social care. His mother had refused help from social service which meant he was not able to get a "vital bit of respite if only for a few hours a week". "People shouldn't be able to refuse care if there is a desperate need," he said. A West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said it had been decided there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Jennens and it "was in the public interest to proceed with a prosecution". He added: "Following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, where prosecution and defence evidence was put to the jury, Mr Jennens was found not guilty to the charge put to him. We respect this decision." Carers UK - 0808 808 7777 Carers Direct - 0300 123 1053 Samaritans - (Free phone) 116 123 West Midlands Police said its investigation was "thorough". "Our priority is and will always be to pursue the right and proper course of action in the interests of public safety and justice, especially when dealing with vulnerable members of society," added a spokeswoman. Diane Wake, chief executive of the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, said: "This is a very tragic case and our thoughts are with the family. We investigate every death in hospital and these form part of our mortality review process. "No clinical issues were raised during our investigation and we would be happy to discuss any concerns the family have with them."	A son cleared of killing his mother has spoken of his relief, saying: "Who wants the stigma of being known as 'the bloke who kills their mum?'"
The singer had forgotten about the work, entitled Little Electric Chair, presented as a gift in the 1970s. "It was a rock 'n' roll time, none of us thought about anything," Cooper's long-time manager, Shep Gordon, said. A similar version of the Warhol artwork sold at Christie's in New York in 2014 for $10.5m (Â£8m). Cooper's find, a red silkscreen on canvas, was part of Warhol's Death and Disaster series and was discovered "rolled up in a tube" in a locker along with a collection of 1970s stage props, Mr Gordon told BBC Radio 5 live. It was the decade that Cooper and Warhol met and became friends. "It was all a swirl of drugs and drinking," said Mr Gordon, who has been the singer's manager for more than four decades. Cooper, real name Vincent Furnier, moved to New York with his late girlfriend Cindy Lang, where they were introduced to Warhol and spent time together in New York's famed Studio 54 nightclub, according to Mr Gordon. Ms Lang, who appeared on the second cover of Warhol's magazine Interview, later asked Mr Gordon to purchase the work on her behalf for about $2,500 as she planned to present it to Cooper as a birthday gift. "He was a very heavy drinker in those days," Mr Gordon told the BBC, adding that Cooper's career was "like a rocket ship taking off back in the early 70s - he was working 100 shows a year". Mr Gordon said the rock singer was "getting electrocuted" at the time in his live shows using a prop electric chair that looked "very much" like the chair in the painting. He said that Cooper later entered rehab as a result of his drinking and "never really moved into his apartment in New York". The painting, he said, was forgotten. "Nobody really ever thought about it, life went on," Mr Gordon said. Years later, Mr Gordon was having dinner with friends, one of whom happened to be an art dealer, when the conversation turned to a piece of work by Warhol that had sold for a large sum. "So I got hold of Alice and I said: 'Do you still have that Warhol?' And he said: 'I don't think so'." Mr Gordon said it was months before they tracked it down to the storage facility. "And then we found a tube, like the type you keep posters in, and there it was - oops!" He said that back in the early 1970s the artwork was not considered particularly valuable. "Andy Warhol was not 'Andy Warhol' back then," he said. The artist died in 1987 at the age of 58. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Gordon said that Cooper had a vague recollection of discussing the artwork with Warhol. "He thinks the conversation was real, but he couldn't put his hand on a Bible and say that it was," Mr Gordon said. The work has been confirmed as authentic by Warhol expert Richard Polsky. "You should have seen Alice's face when Richard Polsky's estimate came in," Mr Gordon said, adding: "His jaw dropped and he looked at me: 'Are you serious? I own that!'"	US rock musician Alice Cooper has found a classic Andy Warhol artwork rolled up in storage after more than 40 years tucked away alongside tour equipment.
The spread-betting tycoon said it was "odds on" - and he urged those thinking about defecting to get in touch with him "for the sake of the country". A UKIP source has also told BBC News the party is talking to five to 10 Labour MPs about possible defection. But this was firmly denied by Labour, who accused UKIP of mischief-making. Mr Carswell officially resigned as an MP on Friday, a day after he announced he was quitting the Conservatives and would fight a subsequent by-election as a UKIP candidate because he did not believe David Cameron was "serious" about reforming Britain's relationship with Europe. The prime minister described the move as "slightly bizarre", telling reporters that Mr Carswell was one of those who wanted to leave the EU irrespective of the outcome of negotiations he was confident would lead to a better deal for Britain in Europe. "He fought as a Conservative in 2010 when we didn't have a commitment to an in-out referendum and he has left the Conservative Party at a time we do have a commitment to an in-out referendum - that is a question for him to explain rather than me." Mr Carswell's defection prompted a flurry of speculation that other Eurosceptic backbenchers would jump ship - fuelled by Mr Wheeler's revelation that he had discussed the possibility with eight of them in recent years, although he declined to name names. He told BBC News he had approached 10 Tory MPs and eight had agreed to meet him secretly for lunch at his favourite Italian restaurant in Mayfair. They did not include Mr Carswell, he revealed, adding that UKIP leader Nigel Farage had handled that defection personally, and he had not always directly asked them to defect, just inquired whether they wanted to meet Mr Farage. Asked by BBC Radio 4's Becky Milligan, if any of them had been tempted to defect, he said: "I am sure they will be tempted but the question is whether they give into that temptation." Asked about the likelihood of other defections before the general election, he said: "If I had to put money on, one way or another, before I knew the result of this by-election, I would say odds on, more likely than not but only just." MPs wanting to discuss their future should contact him in the strictest of confidence, added the former Tory donor. "For the sake of the country they should defect because we are doing the right thing for the country and the Conservative Party are doing the wrong thing," he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. A senior UKIP source also told Becky Milligan that the party was talking to five to ten Labour MPs about possibly changing affiliation. The MPs in question, the source said, were "deeply unhappy with their party, and feel that people are fed up being patronised by the Labour glitterati". But Labour firmly denied any of its MPs were in talks with UKIP or considering defection. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: "I'm not about to jump and you won't see other Labour MPs jumping." He said he was not aware of any Labour MPs who had sufficient doubts about Labour's stance on Europe to look elsewhere. Mr Farage, who visited Mr Carswell's constituency with his new colleague, said he was "constantly" talking to Eurosceptics in the Tory and Labour Party. Mr Farage told reporters: "There is only one party for a genuine Eurosceptic. That is UKIP." He said talk of further defections was "speculation", but added: "If Douglas Carswell wins this by-election, and I believe he will, there will be others on the Tory and Labour backbenchers who may think 'UKIP is for us.'" Prominent backbenchers Peter Bone, Stewart Jackson and Nadine Dorries are among those to have ruled out a defection to Nigel Farage's party as Eurosceptic Tory MPs rallied round David Cameron. The seaside seat of Clacton's population is older than the national average, and pollsters have found that UKIP's appeal is strongest among the over-60s. Analysis of demographic data by Nottingham University's Matthew Goodwin suggests that Clacton is "the most favourable seat for UKIP in the country". In graphics: Will Clacton's voters opt for UKIP? Conservative Eurosceptic John Redwood said talk of eight possible defections was a "figment of UKIP's imagination", suggesting that this was merely an estimate of the number of MPs who may have had lunch with Mr Wheeler. "Dream on UKIP. It is the kind of figure that you would put round if you were UKIP." he told Radio 4's Today programme. Among MPs to have ruled out joining UKIP include long-standing EU rebels Mark Pritchard, John Baron, Bill Cash, Bernard Jenkin and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Speaking in Clacton, Mr Carswell said he had a "phenomenal amount of support" since announcing his decision, adding there had been a "real shift in opinion locally". He added: "I could lose. There is a risk in this. I am putting my principles on the table." A local councillor in Sevenoaks, Kent, has become the first elected representative to defect from the Conservatives to UKIP since Mr Carswell's decision. Chris Neal, who represents the Cowden and Heaver ward on Sevenoaks District Council, said he felt the Conservatives "no longer have the interests of ordinary people at heart" and their position on the EU was "an insult to democracy". He said he had considered "staying quiet" until next May's local elections, when he plans to step down as a councillor, but had been inspired to switch sides by Mr Carswell.	Further Conservative MPs are "more likely than not" to follow Douglas Carswell to UKIP, the party's treasurer Stuart Wheeler has told the BBC.
