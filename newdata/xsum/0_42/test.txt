An emotional Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland left the talks in Brussels, saying the EU was "not capable" of signing a trade agreement. Belgium, the only country blocking accord, needed consent from the regional parliament of Wallonia. The wide-ranging deal, seven years in the making, was to be signed next week. Speaking outside the seat of the Walloon government, Ms Freeland told reporters:  "It seems evident for me and for Canada that the European Union is not now capable of having an international accord even with a country that has values as European as Canada." She added: "Canada is disappointed, but I think it is impossible." It was unclear whether the EU would keep negotiating with Wallonia in coming days to solve the impasse. European Parliament briefing on Ceta The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, was expected to boost bilateral trade, but Wallonia sees the accord as a threat to farmers and welfare standards. The region has a strong socialist tradition. Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments. There have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks with the US. The Canada-EU trade deal was seven years in the making but it took far less time to unravel. Canada has been scrambling to keep Ceta together after the Walloon regional assembly in Belgium voted last week to reject it. The deal was completed under Canada's former Conservative government but is a major priority for the Liberals, who are under pressure to boost the country's economy. They dispatched special envoy Pierre Pettigrew, a former cabinet minister with a wealth of experience on the international trade file, to help save the flagging agreement. Federal trade minister Chrystia Freeland has met repeatedly over the past months with European leaders to shepherd it through, but with no luck. The failure to clinch the EU-Canada Ceta deal is an embarrassment for the EU. Wallonia, a region of just 3.6 million people, has all but scuppered a trade deal affecting 508 million Europeans and 36.3 million Canadians. The European Commission says this blow does not mean that Ceta is over, but it also refuses to unpick the massive text that was agreed with Canada in 2014. Any EU free trade deals with the US, China or India now look remote. Anti-globalisation groups, anxious to protect Europe's welfare and environmental standards, may feel they are winning the argument. For now, any Ceta boost for small businesses and jobs has been postponed. The failure gives us a sense of how tough the Brexit talks will be, despite the UK's current alignment with its EU partners. One very obvious lesson from this impasse is that it is going to be difficult for the European Union to implement trade and investment deals, perhaps with anyone. For the UK post-Brexit it suggests two contrasting implications. Negotiating a trade agreement that gives British exporters barrier free access to the EU's single market could be a huge challenge. For sure, there will be some important differences. For the EU, Britain is a more important export market than Canada, so some EU states will have a good deal to lose from failing to agree. But securing the agreement of all of them is unlikely to be straightforward. On the other hand, negotiating an agreement with other countries outside the EU should become easier. To put it bluntly, the British government won't need to care what the Walloon parliament, for example, thinks.	A trade deal between the EU and Canada is on the brink of collapse because a Belgian region with a population of just 3.6 million objects.
Social media videos shot in the Plaza Major showed injured fans and officers in body armour wielding batons. BBC journalist Phil Mackie confirmed police used baton charges to clear parts of the square. Earlier, Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for "causing a mess" on Tuesday night. Footage posted online showed a group of officers being targeted with missiles and fans chanting "Gibraltar is ours" in the Plaza Major, where Leicester's fans were told they could congregate. A witness told BBC 5 live: "There were a couple of people who probably antagonised the police, but then they took it out all these people here. "There were people with children, they came in with batons and there was a 70-year-old man and the kids [in the way]." Owynn Palmer-Atkin, reporting for BBC Radio Leicester, said: "There was a couple of flares that went off - blue smoke, then a bang, and that is when you heard the tone of the chanting change. "The noise of the crowd seem to quieten and then become more of a panic. "There was another bang and that is when the riot vans started charging across the square. I find it incredible a police van would travel that fast in a crowded square." BBC presenter Gary Lineker, a Leicester City fan and former Foxes player, tweeted: "Just saw the footage of some Leicester fans behaving despicably in Madrid. The few idiots ruin it for the decent majority. Sickening.." On Tuesday night, Phil Mackie said he witnessed what appeared to be an unprovoked attack on supporters. He reported seeing police charging a group of Leicester fans walking in the city centre before three were pushed to the ground, hit with batons and bundled into the back of vans. Police said six officers were also attacked in the overnight disturbances. The eight fans arrested remain in custody and will appear in court on Thursday.	Leicester City fans were involved in further clashes with Spanish police ahead of their Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid.
The doctors' union said patient care was undermined when GPs were forced to see as many as 60 patients a day. It called for more funding to allow GPs to spend at least 15 minutes with each patient. NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes. However, the NHS Choices website does state that "GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient" and advises patients to "plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss". The BMA, which published a report on "safe working in general practice" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced "unsustainable pressure" from increasing workload and staff shortages. The report said it was intended to "stimulate discussion" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK. Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times "insulting". "With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments," she said. "To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work. "I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues. "Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm. I rarely get home before 8pm, having started generally at 7.30am. "Nobody goes into medicine for an easy ride, we are all hard workers, but the intensity and the demand are now at unsafe levels." Dr Ali Alibhai, who works in central London, said GPs now had to manage so many chronic diseases such as diabetes that a consultation as short as eight minutes was "not appropriate any more for safe patient care". Dr Brian Balmer, of the BMA's GPs' committee, said that, in an ageing population, many patients had complex multiple conditions that needed longer to treat. He warned that many GPs were being forced to truncate care and deliver an "unsafe number of consultations". He said consultations should be limited to 25 a day, about the same number recommended in many other EU countries. Dr Balmer added: "We need a new approach that shakes up the way patients get their care from their local GP practice. "The consultation time needs to increase to 15 minutes with the government providing on its promised funding to make this work." Health think tank the King's Fund said its analysis showed GPs were under "huge pressure due to an increase in workload which has not been matched by a growth in funding or the workforce". It also found the average length of consultations had increased due to the rising number of older patients with more complex conditions. King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham said general practice needed "new investment to stop it falling apart", but GPs must also embrace new methods such as giving more advice by phone and email. NHS England said the length of appointments was "at the discretion of individual GP practices, based on patient need, and there are no national limits suggesting 10 minutes should be the norm". It accepted that GPs were "under pressure", and said it was "substantially increasing investment and reforming care to free up GPs to spend more time with patients". In 2013, a rule saying GP appointment slots in England must be for a minimum of 10 minutes was scrapped. One patient, John White, from Somerset, said: "I think those who get a 10-minute consultation with their GPs are lucky. "At my doctors' surgery I cannot even book an appointment to see my GP. All we are offered is to book a 'telephone triage consultation' where your doctor will call you by telephone and decide whether a face-to-face appointment is warranted. "I have had to wait in excess of two weeks for the telephone appointment." Another patient, Maggy Jackson, said: "I have a brilliant GP who sees me for as long as I need. He always runs on time too. "All I can say is if it wasn't for this practice I would be dead. They diagnosed a gangrenous hernia two years ago when I presented with horrendous pain and no appointment. I was given a full examination, morphine and was in hospital an hour later after their intervention." Nurse Liz Wright said appointment length was also an issue in nursing. "In years gone by, I had either 15 or 20-minute appointments to see my patients," she said. "This has now been cut to 10 minutes, in which to carry out triage, cervical smears, dressings, injections, contraceptive discussions and issuing of prescriptions and a whole range of ailments. "This means that in a typical 7.5-hour shift, I see up to 42 patients, well above the recommended daily amount. "In my opinion this is unsafe practice and I have decided to take early retirement."	Patients are being put at risk by GPs being forced to carry out complex consultations in 10 minutes or under, the British Medical Association says.
Matt Wilmot, 40, was found by police after reports of concern for the welfare of a man.  He was pronounced dead at the scene, in Devon Road, Luton. Affinity Water confirmed "the body of a man was found at the bottom of one of our excavations". Bedfordshire Police said Mr Wilmot's death, at about 07:15 BST on Sunday, was not being treated as suspicious. The force said it was not possible to speculate on how he died until the coroner's full report had been released. More news from Bedfordshire It is understood Mr Wilmot, a father-of-two, had been walking home from Dunstable, where he had been watching the FA Cup Final on Saturday afternoon. Mr Wilmot's partner of 24 years, Tania Banks, said: "I just can't believe that he's gone and the circumstances [in which] he's gone. "We're just angry at the situation... and how something like this could happen." The Health and Safety Executive has been informed about the incident, police said.	The body of a man has been found at the bottom of a hole dug by a water firm.
The incident at Neil McEvoy's office took place on Thursday morning. The AM said no valuables were taken but files had been "gone through". He said metal bars had been cut to access the property at Cowbridge Road East. South Wales Police said an investigation had been launched. "For a long period, there has been a concerted campaign of political harassment against me," the South Wales Central AM claimed. He said that less than 12 months ago his home had been "ransacked", with paperwork taken. Mr McEvoy said that in the early hours of Thursday "the criminals involved went through two outside doors, down a lane, removed a screwed in hard wood cover on the back window, cut through a PVC window frame and cut through metal bars to get in the window". "Once again, valuables were ignored in the office, but drawers were broken into and files gone through in the back office which wasn't alarmed. "Thankfully, they couldn't gain access to the main part of the office without tripping the alarm." "I put in place new safety procedures for staff at the end of last term, because I am aware of serious cages being rattled," he said. "Some people would like to silence us, but this intimidation has just added to our motivation." A South Wales Police spokesman said that the break-in was reported after 09:00 GMT on Thursday. He said that investigations were ongoing and that no arrests had been made. A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: "Neil McEvoy has now been the subject of two break-ins, one at home and one at his office. "Plaid Cymru is supporting him and his staff at this time and is keen that the police establish whether these intrusions are linked. "All elected representatives and their staff deserve to operate in a democratic way without fear of harassment or intimidation. "The National Assembly is working with Neil and his staff to ensure their safety and security, and we strongly urge that this continues."â€Ž	A Plaid Cymru AM has claimed he has been a victim of "political harassment" after a break-in at his constituency office in Cardiff.
Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75% of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BP/Castrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25% shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50% were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.	A surprise new name has emerged as a potential successor to long-standing McLaren boss Ron Dennis, whose position as chairman is under threat.
Police Scotland said two men broke into the farm house near to Corsock, Castle Douglas, between 23:30 on Thursday and 01:00 on Friday. They stole items including a number of war medals, gold watches and antiques. Officers have appealed for information and said the robbers may have been "casing" the property before the raid. Det Sgt Graeme Robertson said: "I believe that whoever broke into this house knew what they were looking for - that is the medals, watches and antiques. "Thankfully the householder, a woman, who was in the house at the time, was not injured but she is very upset by what has happened." The men were described as being well spoken, with Scottish accents, of average height and build and wearing dark clothing. One of the men was wearing a balaclava and gloves. "Due to the rural location of the house and the items taken, we believe that the two men would have had to have the use of a car. "It is also entirely possible that they may have been in the area before the break in 'casing' the house so I would ask anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour around the area during this time, or anyone who may have been offered these items for sale, to contact police."	A woman has been left uninjured but very upset after two men forced their way into her home and stole valuables believed to be worth thousands.
The tourists face three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches after a 4-0 Test series defeat. The batting line-up for Sunday's first ODI in Pune is expected to be Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler. "There's a couple of wickets there for the spinners," said Swann. "We play spin horrifically on the whole." The tourists, who are without a one-day international series victory in India since 1984, have won one and lost one of their warm-up matches against India A - the defeat coming after they slipped from 116-1 to 165-6 when batting first in Mumbai. Bairstow top-scored with 64 in that second match and he disputes Swann's assertion that England will struggle with the bat. "Everyone has different methods for batting against seam and spin," said the Yorkshire wicketkeeper. "We scored a lot of runs in the Test series - posting 500 once and 400 twice. "And in these warm-ups we've scored around 300 in both matches despite the collapses, so I don't think we're far off to be honest." Swann, speaking to BBC Test Match Special, did exempt Bairstow and Root from his criticism while conceding that a limited-overs tour of India is one of the hardest assignments in world cricket. "It's not a very pleasant experience," said the 37-year-old. "I don't think I ever won there. "The teams I played in were clueless in how to cope with the noise, the intensity, the armed guards. "I remember being on the tour that ended because of the attacks in Mumbai. In a weird way, it was a relief that we could go home - we were getting hammered left, right and centre. "The crowds definitely play a part - you can't hear yourself think for three and a half hours. It envelops you. "When you get back into the changing room - it's like a day spa. There's total silence." India will be led by star batsman Virat Kohli, who replaces World Cup-winning captain MS Dhoni, in the three-match ODI series which also includes matches in Cuttack (19 January) and Kolkata (22 January). Dhoni will, however, remain in the team as a wicketkeeper-batsman, with the 35-year-old warming up for the challenge with an unbeaten 68 off 40 balls for India A in England's first warm-up game earlier in the week. Only Dhoni's fellow Indians Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh and Australia's Dean Jones have a better one-day average in home conditions against England than him. "You could sense experience dripping off MS Dhoni," said Swann. "He'd never panic, even when the required rate reached eight or nine an over. "He'd just smack 20 off an over without breaking sweat. "Over there, the grounds are tiny and the outfields are rapid. What we construed as being a big score - 270 or 280 - they'd just knock off in no time whatsoever. "Virat Kohli was born to play ODI cricket and MS Dhoni is the best finisher I've ever seen." While Swann is fearful of another series defeat for England, he is glad to see the fresh outlook that has been adopted under captain Morgan. Swann, who played at the 2011 World Cup, says he belonged to a "dinosaur" age of one-day cricket in England and says the team were "backward in their thinking" and "arrogant". It is only since a chastening early exit at the 2015 World Cup that England have adopted a more positive gameplan that has seen them twice pass 400 in 50 overs. "They've finally got all the youngsters playing who think nothing is impossible," said Swann. "The likes of Ben Stokes, Jason Roy and Alex Hales have never thought 280 was a good score. They happily think 400 is gettable. "They also have a coach who encourages aggressive cricket."	England's batsmen will continue to fail in India if they persist in playing slow bowling "horrifically", says their former off-spinner Graeme Swann.
Areas in Counties Londonderry, Antrim and Down were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland Electricity said was an equipment fault was detected at 21.40 BST. All properties have had power restored had their power restored by 22.14 BST.	Several thousand customers were left without electricity for a time on Wednesday night.
Mooboo Bubble Tea - which sells the Taiwanese drink topped with tapioca balls - was attacked on social media and by campaign groups. A petition to demand it pay staff properly collected more than 40,000 signatures. In a statement, Mooboo said trainees would now be paid "company set levels". Emails outlining the original terms were leaked to campaign organisation 38 Degrees. Gordon Maloney from the group said it was an "outrageous way for MooBoo Bubble Tea to exploit people looking for work". He welcomed the "turnaround" but said it was "very important to us that people who have worked for the chain for free under this policy should also be recompensed". The company has branches in London, Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Gateshead, Hatfield, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow. Successful interview applicants were offered 40 hours training, but warned this did not guarantee a job. Mooboo said in a statement: "In view of the recent feedbacks, we are prepared to implement a new training process which all trainees will be paid according to our company set levels once the trainee has entered into our training contract." It later confirmed to campaign group Betterthanzero that all staff would be paid at least the minimum wage from "the first hour". The furore over the training contract led to other cafes being confused with the firm. Bubble Boba in Coventry "suffered vandalism to our shop, slander and abuse to our staff", it said. Directors Neil and Kristin McCoy-Ward said it was now "Mooboo's duty to set the example and follow UK regulations and pay bubble tea artists correctly for their work".	A cafe criticised for making trainees work unpaid for 40 hours, without a guaranteed job, has given in to public pressure.
Lee Nicholson, 39, from Newcastle, was enlisted by Clare Humble to help dispose of Peter Hedley's body in Newburn Riverside Park in November. Humble, 50, was jailed for life in May for murdering Mr Hedley, 49. Nicholson, of Lydford Court, was jailed for three years and six months after admitting perverting the court of justice at Newcastle Crown Court.	A man who helped his murderer ex-girlfriend bury her boyfriend's body in a Newcastle park has been jailed.
Now a group of walkers is re-tracing his steps. They set off from Shrewsbury Abbey on 18 June, ending up at St Winefride's Well a week later. The walk is part of a week of events to commemorate the historic royal visit and which, it is hoped, will boost the profile of the town. "Holywell has an incredible, unique history," said Rob Owen, one of the organisers of the town's upcoming medieval festival. "Castles are ten a penny in Wales,  but there's only one St Winefride's Well." Mrs Owen is rightly proud of her town's famous landmark - St Winefride's Well has been a place of pilgrimage for more than 1,300 years and is the oldest continually venerated shrine of any British saint. According to legend, Winefride was the daughter of a 7th Century nobleman, who shunned the amorous advances of a local prince named Caradog. Furious at her rejection, Caradog beheaded her as she ran towards the safety of her uncle's church. Her severed head rolled down the hill and a powerful spring burst up from the earth at the place it came to rest. But all was not lost for Winefride - her uncle, St Beuno, placed her head back on her body and prayed and miraculously, she was restored to life. Caradog, meanwhile, met a sticky end:  cursed by St Beuno, his body melted and was swallowed up by the earth. Winefride became a nun and later, Abbess of Gwytherin in Conwy, where she died and was buried. The healing waters of her well are said to bring forth miraculous cures; believers still bathe there today and Holywell has become known as the "Lourdes of Wales". In 1138, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury moved the saint's remains to his abbey, later writing a "Life" - or biography - of Winefride, which was to prove instrumental in spreading her popularity. In medieval times, she became the saintly equivalent of a superstar. "Winefride, or Gwenfrewy as she is known in Welsh, is the only native female saint from Wales to have a substantial hagiographical dossier," says Prof Jane Cartwright, from the University of Wales Trinity St David. "She was effectively a Welsh super saint whose cult extended beyond the Welsh border, since her relics were translated to Shrewsbury. "She had two 12th Century Latin Lives and a 15th Century Welsh Life and she is one of the very few Welsh saints to make it into the Roman Martyrology. Prof Cartwright, who is editing the medieval Welsh life of St Winefride for the Cult of Saints in Wales project, which aims to publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts on saints, adds: "In a sense her cult united England and Wales and she was deemed suitable to be venerated by royalty," At least six royal visitors - including Richard I, Edward IV and James II - have come to Holywell over the centuries. By far the most famous visit was by Henry V in 1416, who, having placed himself under the spiritual protection of St Winefride before the previous year's Battle of Agincourt - where his 6,000 men faced a French army six times the size - walked from Shrewsbury to the shrine to thank her for his victory. The precise date and route of the pilgrimage is unknown; in fact the only written record of it is in Latin, in the Chronicle of Adam of Usk so re-enacting the walk to commemorate its 600th anniversary has presented a challenge. "There have been many attempts to work out the route," says walk organiser Ron Williams, from the Holywell Walkers are Welcome group. "But when you think about it, there is only one way Henry V would have come. "There weren't any roads except those the Romans had left and the Roman road comes to Llangollen from Shrewsbury, so that is most likely how he would have started off. "On top of that he would have known that there was a Cistercian Abbey at Valle Crucis, so it's logical that he came there and if you look at a map, there's a direct line between Llangollen and Holywell so all we've done is put a walking route as near to that as possible. "Of course we can't know it for sure but we think our route is more logical than those which have been put forward before. "We have a good number of people walking the whole thing but we also want people to join in for the day so we've tried to make the walks easy to start and finish," adds Mr Williams. The walkers - including one dressed as Henry V - will be welcomed into Holywell on 24 June. The following day, the "King" will immerse himself in St Winefride's well. An interdenominational service, an afternoon of talks on St Winefride and a medieval festival - complete with storytellers, jesters, archery and combat displays - are also part of the anniversary celebrations. It is hoped the events will provide what festival organiser Mrs Owen claims is a "much-needed" boost for the Flintshire town. "Holywell has been neglected," she said. "It's like an unpolished diamond, a bit rough around the edges and it needs lots of little improvements. "We want to get a much higher profile for the town with this - we want to really put it on the map." Kerry Feather, project director of  St Winefride's Well, agreed: "We want the town and the well to benefit from the attention. "We currently have around 35,000 visitors every year and we really would like to boost that number. "Some people come here for healing but others just find it a place of peace and sanctuary, somewhere to spend time, whether it's in prayer or thought, in an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy world." The organisers of this year's pilgrimage re-enactment also want it to have a lasting legacy - they have applied for Lottery funding for the creation of a new pilgrim's trail from Shrewsbury to Holywell, complete with waymarkers. "Walking a pilgrim's trail is not just a walk, it's a different experience altogether," said Mr Williams. "I'm not religious but you're walking in places where people have walked for centuries and it gets to you. "You think, 'Why were they here, how did they get here, how did they feel?' "It's quite an emotional experience and you get a real sense of connection to the history of the places along the route."	Six centuries ago Henry V walked from Shrewsbury to Holywell in Flintshire, to give thanks for his famous victory over the French at Agincourt.
The device was stolen during the band's concert at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on 25 May. Northumbria Police found the phones at a house in Whitley Bay hours later after using a GPS locator app to find it. A 25-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of theft. Det Insp Dave Swinburn said the force advised concert goers to be "extra vigilant" and recommended smartphone owners install tracking software on their devices.	An iPhone stolen at a Foo Fighters gig led to the discovery of more than 30 missing mobiles after police used a tracker app to locate it.
It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: "Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. "As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish." Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: "The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. "This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government." A Scottish government spokesman said: "Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. "The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts."	Scotland's criminal justice system punishes poorer people and makes it difficult for them to escape poverty, according to an academic study.

22 December 2015 Last updated at 09:18 GMT They're all back on the big screen again in The Peanuts Movie. The characters have been revived for their first feature film in 35 years, by the creator Charles Schulz's son and grandson. Other familiar characters are also back including Charlie Brown's friend the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Snoopy's nemesis the Red Baron. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock and Lucy all spoke to entertainment reporter Genevieve Hassan.	Charles Schulz's characters, Charlie Brown and Snoopy have been talking about the secret of their strong friendships.
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: "Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years." There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. "For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists," Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. "I could never have imagined that." The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians "to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.	Journalists have been accused of treason; a chief prosecutor fired; and we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of government ministers scrambling to get out of the firing line after popular outrage.
Kerry Foods confirmed the redundancies, which were initially announced in February. The company said a consultation process "had failed to secure a strategy which would ensure the sustainability of production at the site". The firm said it was retaining the factory on the town's Europarc industrial estate and was looking at "future possibilities for the site". Kerry Foods said employees were given confirmation of the plant's closure on Wednesday following a 90-day consultation period. A company spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to assist employees in securing new employment."	A Grimsby frozen food factory has closed with the loss of 337 jobs.
Despite taking an early lead the Teessiders were 3-2 down at half-time. "You can't question the attitude, commitment and effort, it was first class," Agnew told BBC Tees. "But we were a bit naive at times defensively, not just the back four, as a team. So we all take responsibility for that and look forward to Burnley." England defender Ben Gibson was culpable for the first two goals having failed to clear, while Hull's fourth goal came as Harry Maguire was unchallenged in the penalty area. The defeat left Boro in 19th place after 30 games, seven points behind Hull, who are one place above the relegation zone. Middlesbrough welcome Burnley to the Riverside on Saturday.	Middlesbrough's defensive "naivety" cost them in Wednesday's 4-2 Premier League defeat by Hull City, says head coach Steve Agnew.
It said lack of awareness and a shortage of trainees meant police often ended up questioning adults with mental illness or learning issues without one. Home Secretary Theresa May said the situation was "not acceptable". Appropriate adults are trained volunteers who help with communication during police interviews. They are supposed to ensure mentally vulnerable people who are arrested or questioned understand what is happening, and that their legal rights and welfare are safeguarded. They were introduced in the 1980s following miscarriages of justice involving vulnerable people. Local authorities are required to provide appropriate adults whenever children are in contact with police and there is no parent or guardian present, but there is no duty to do the same in respect of vulnerable adults. In some areas, no organised scheme for adults exists. Researchers analysed police data and found appropriate adults were used in about 45,000 of the 1.4m detentions and voluntary interviews of adults each year. It is estimated that 280,000 of those detentions involves a person who is "mentally vulnerable". What does an appropriate adult do? Appropriate adults do not provide legal advice, but assist with rights and broader welfare. Nuala Chapman, an appropriate adult, told BBC Radio 5 live that she would be called after a medical practitioner had decided someone in custody needed support. "We then go to the station, we go through all the processes with them, we make sure they understand what is going on, we go through interview with them and... facilitate communication between all the people in the interview," she said. "Our role ends once they have either been charged or bailed." The report, entitled There to Help, found police were least likely to identify vulnerability in areas which did not have an organised appropriate adult scheme. Custody officers reported spending hours trying to find a suitable appropriate adult. They admitted to sometimes asking random members of the public, or proceeding without one. Chris Bath, chief executive of the National Appropriate Adult Network, the charity which led the study, said: "People with learning disabilities, mental ill health, traumatic brain injuries or autistic spectrum disorders are some of the most vulnerable citizens, and state detention is perhaps the most vulnerable situation. "We have a moral and a legal duty to ensure appropriate adults are available wherever people live." The report's recommendations include: The home secretary said appropriate adults "provide vital support and help to demystify what can be a confusing, sometimes frightening, experience in police custody". Mrs May added: "The status quo is not acceptable and I am concerned that vulnerable adults are not always receiving the support of an appropriate adult. "We are currently examining the recommendations and implementation options to ensure that vulnerable people are provided with the support they are entitled to." Avtar Bhatoa, from the Law Society, said appropriate adults were needed to ensure "fair justice for all". "With the right support, mentally vulnerable people are less likely to suffer an injustice or to waive their right to free legal advice through fear and misunderstanding, which can compound their disadvantage in the justice system, " he said.	Up to a quarter of a million vulnerable people are not being supported by an "appropriate adult" while in police custody, a Home Office report suggests.
A pre-inquest review was due to take place on Monday, but has now been postponed until March. West Sussex County Council said the full inquest was now likely to be held late 2017, but was "very dependent" on the police investigation. A lawyer representing some of the victims' families described "a measure of frustration" at the news. A vintage hawker hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during an aerobatic stunt at the Shoreham show in August 2015, killing 11 men. The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived the crash and is being investigated for manslaughter. Plans were put in place for the inquest to begin in March, but neither the police investigation nor the full Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report have yet been published. Specialist aviation lawyer James Healey Pratt said the victims' families had full confidence in the coroner and the investigation. He said the pre-inquest hearing was being delayed until March as a decision by the CPS on whether to bring charges was due then. He also revealed the families had been invited to a meeting in Farnborough on 19 December, at which they would be told the results of the AAIB investigation. Sussex Police's report is not expected until the new year at the earliest. West Sussex Senior Coroner Penelope Schofield said the decision to postpone the pre-inquest review was "not taken lightly", particularly as she was anxious to ensure the inquests were dealt with in a timely manner. But it was anticipated little progress could be made with the police and AAIB report still outstanding, she added.	An inquest into the deaths of 11 men at the Shoreham Airshow is not likely for another year, the BBC can reveal.
The move comes a day after a federal appeals court in San Francisco lifted a ban that had been in place since 2008. Many Californian gay couples then rushed to get married. But the opponents say the appeals court acted prematurely because by law they had more time to appeal before the ban can be lifted. Friday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court followed a ruling by the US Supreme Court against supporters of the California ban on gay marriage. On Saturday the Alliance Defending Freedom, which supports the ban, filed the petition asking the Supreme Court to overrule the order by appeals court. The group argued that by law it had 25 days to challenge the Supreme Court ruling, and therefore that the ban should not have been lifted. The Alliance Defending Freedom described the appeals court order as "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities". The gay marriage ban - known as Proposition 8 - was approved by voters in 2008, months after California's supreme court decided such unions were legal. The two couples then launched the legal challenge. As the state of California refused to defend the proposition, the group that sponsored it stepped up to do so. But on Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that a private party could not challenge the earlier lower court ruling, as it could not demonstrate it would suffer injury if same-sex marriages were allowed.	Opponents of same-sex marriage in California have filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court to try to halt gay weddings in the state.
About 2,000 pieces dating back more than 1,000 years were spotted on the seabed by members of a diving club, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said. At first the group thought the coins were toys, but quickly realised the significance of their discovery. The Antiquities Authority said the find was "so valuable that it's priceless". Divers were exploring an ancient harbour in Caesarea when they came across the gold. They collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore to inform the director of the club. Experts from the authority called to the site uncovered "almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations" circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171. Kobi Sharvit, director of the marine archaeology unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said excavations would be carried out in the hope of shedding more light on the origin of the treasure. He added: "There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected. "Perhaps the treasure of coins was meant to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison which was stationed in Caesarea and protected the city." He said another theory was that the treasure belonged to a large merchant ship that traded with the coastal cities and the port on the Mediterranean Sea. The haul, which weighs 9kg (20lb), is believed to have been exposed as a result of winter storms. It is now the property of the state and there was no finders' fee.	Scuba divers have inadvertently discovered the largest trove of gold coins ever found off Israel's Mediterranean coast.
The party secured about 19% of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25% voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14% of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12%. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10% of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. "Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: "Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes." The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25% of the total vote or 20% of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3% on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. "We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead," Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was "widely open" to a coalition. "It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone. We have to co-operate with those having the same platform," he said.	Indonesia's opposition Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leads parliamentary polls but its star candidate may face a tougher path to the presidency, early election results indicate.
Media playback is not supported on this device Fifteen of those won gold. How many of them will be back to defend their titles in 2016 at the Rio Olympic Games, and who else might come through the ranks to join them? A week is a long time in sport, never mind four years. But here, BBC Sport takes an early look at some names in the frame for future Olympic fame. Media playback is not supported on this device Six of the 12 British Olympians who won more than one medal at London 2012 were younger than 26. Laura Trott, 20, and boyfriend Jason Kenny, 24, were both double Olympic champions in the velodrome, Andy Murray, 25,took tennis gold and silver, gymnasts Louis Smith, 23,and Max Whitlock, 19,both picked up two medals, and Rebecca Adlington, 23,won double bronze in freestyle swimming. It would be risky to bet against any of them returning for Rio. Trott, in particular, has the chance to establish a legacy to match Sir Chris Hoy's record medal haul over the next decade, having dominated her team pursuit and omnium events in recent years. Adlington has some thinking to do after losing both of her Olympic titles, particularly following the stunning performance of American 15-year-old Katie Ledecky over her favoured 800m distance. Smith has suggested younger gymnasts may prove better all-rounders and push him out of the 2016 gymnastics team. But you can expect Whitlock to be a bedrock of that squad if he maintains his progress, while Trott and Kenny should have at least two more Olympic outings left in them, if not more. Murray will certainly hope to defend his singles title in Rio. Of course, 25 is something of an arbitrary barrier. In many sports, you can just as easily win a medal in your 40s or 50s as your teens. Many of GB's gold medallists can be expected to fight for their place, if not retain their title, in four years' time - think of the likes of Jess Ennis, 26,and Mo Farah, 29, plus many of the GB rowing team. To take an example from the opposite end of the spectrum: Nick Skelton is 54, has come back from a broken neck and a hip replacement, and now needs work on his back - but the team showjumping champion plans to return. Media playback is not supported on this device Plenty of likely candidates for Rio 2016 have already broken into the team at London 2012, even if they didn't grab the headlines. The most obvious of these is Adam Gemili, the world junior champion over 100m, whose time of 10.06 seconds in the Olympic semi-finals saw him narrowly miss out on a place in the final alongside the likes of Jamaican winner Usain Bolt and his team-mate Yohan Blake. Gemili, still only 18, has already been hailed by US rival Tyson Gay as a man with the potential to become one of the greatest in history. By Rio, we will know a lot more about what the former footballer can achieve on the track. Nineteen-year-old Katarina Johnson-Thompson (heptathlon or long jump) and 20-year-old hurdler Andrew Pozzi are others whose names were lower down the 2012 card but could top the billing in Rio. Andrew Osagie, the 800m runner, finished last in his final as David Rudisha stormed home in a new world record, but the Briton ran a personal best that would have won gold at any of the three previous Olympics. He will be 28 in 2016. In contrast Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee occupied every headline going with his stunning win but will face renewed pressure from younger brother Jonny in Rio. The two look set to dominate their sport for years to come, but 22-year-old Jonny may yet have it in him to surpass his 24-year-old sibling in time for Rio, having taken bronze behind Alistair in Hyde Park. In gymnastics, Rebecca Tunney made her Olympic debut as the youngest member of Team GB at the age of 15, looking assured and unfazed in the women's all-around final. She will spend the next four years increasing the difficulty of her routines although, in a sport with a phenomenally high turnover rate as new gymnasts come on the scene, she already faces a battle to keep her place in the British team. Fencer James Davis impressed as Britain valiantly scrapped to a narrow defeat by world number ones Italy in the men's team foil event, and he could be joined by world junior epee champion Philip Marsh in Rio. Teenager Harry Martin somehow managed to have a decent game for the GB men's hockey team as they were drubbed 9-2 by the Netherlands in their semi-final and is one to watch, while rowing trio Constantine Louloudis, George Nash and Will Satch all picked up bronze at Eton Dorney and will look to upgrade that in Brazil. Swimming was a disappointment for Britain at their home Games, and now the search is on for future stars. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, the 16-year-old breaststroke swimmer from Bath, may be one of them if she can improve her race strategy. Diver Jack Laugher struggled in his 3m competition and finished 27th but he will only be 21 by the time of Rio; Tom Daley, of course, will be just 22 himself. Some of the GB stars at Rio 2016 could be in sports entirely new to the Games. British teams will fancy their chances at medals in rugby sevens, introduced to the Olympic programme for the first time, with Michaela Staniford a name to remember as the 25-year-old captain of the current England women's team. Kiteboarding replaces windsurfing for Rio and Steph Bridge, a four-time world champion in the sport for Britain, has already seen her profile rise as a result. If windsurfing wins its appeal against losing its place, Izzy Hamilton could benefit. The pro windsurfer is also taking up kiteboarding with a view to reaching Rio, no matter which of the two is included. Elsewhere in sailing, 22-year-old Katrina Hughes - who lost her battle for a place in the women's 470 boat to Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, this time - will be back and raring to go alongside partner Penny Clark for 2016. A crop of gymnasts are preparing to emerge from the increasingly successful British junior production line. European junior champions Frank Baines and Nile Wilson are two leading lights on the men's side while Youth Olympic trampolinist Nathan Bailey is hoping to star at 2016. Ellie Downie, younger sister of 2008 Olympic gymnast Becky, is just 12 years old now but will be 16 and could have reached her peak by the time of the next Games. Cycling has a seemingly endless conveyor belt of talent to raid for 2016. Names like Lucy Garner and Simon Yates, both already junior world champions in their short careers, could be firmly established in senior circles well before then. Other names waiting in the wings for Rio include boxer Chantelle Cameron, eventer Laura Collett and modern pentathletes Freyja Prentice and Jamie Cooke, the latter tipped by his coaches as a future world champion. Rowers Pat Lapage and Mike Evans, and Michael Eilberg with Woodlander Farouche in dressage, will also hope to be in Rio.	More than 30 of the Britons who won medals at London 2012 were aged 25 or under.
Borthwick, 36, left his role at the Championship side after only 43 days. The former England captain arrived at Bristol several weeks into the season having helped Eddie Jones coach Japan. "It's kicked us quite hard because this has been about planning and waiting for Steve to arrive," said Robinson. Borthwick was named forwards coach with Jones' new-look England in acrimonious circumstances last week, with Bristol owner Steve Lansdown describing the Rugby Football Union as "unprofessional" in their handling of the appointment. Robinson was forwards coach during England's World Cup-winning era under Sir Clive Woodward before taking over as England head coach himself from 2004-06. And, while he is unimpressed by the manner of Borthwick's exit, he is certain England have made an astute appointment. "I was delighted to have signed Steve and I certainly hoped he would be here for longer than 43 days," Robinson told BBC Radio Bristol. "He is a quality coach and he will be a quality coach for England and I wish him all the best. I know the England team will enjoy working with him. "I'm disappointed in the circumstance of how it's happened and why it's happened but legally I can't say too much and we have to move forward." Robinson, who has also coached Scotland, says he will not rush into appointing a replacement and has urged his forwards to handle the responsibility of Borthwick's departure. "It's down to the players to step up collectively over the next four months for us to achieve what we want to achieve," he said. "We have to focus on the next couple of weeks, with tough games coming up against London Welsh and Nottingham. There is a lot to be done over the next few weeks."	Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson says the club have been hit hard by the departure of forwards coach Steve Borthwick, who he believes will be successful with England.
Research suggests Oxford may be affected the most by public sector cuts Oxford among worst GCSE results Chairman of Oxfordshire Economic Partnership Frank Nigriello said small firms would not have jobs available. It comes as research suggests Oxford has one of the highest number of employees in vulnerable sectors. The BBC-commissioned study, carried out by Experian, ranks the resilience of council areas to economic shocks. In the research, Oxford was rated the third highest in England for the number of employees working in vulnerable sectors. Figures from the government estimate 48% of jobs in Oxford East are in the public sector. Mr Nigriello said Oxfordshire had very few large companies, with many people employed in the county's pioneering health services, as well as research and development, including Oxford University. He added: "If there are massive cuts in the public sector, then Oxfordshire's private sector won't have the resilience. "Small businesses don't have the opportunities or availability of jobs." A special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spending The Spending Review: Making It Clear The Oxfordshire Economic Partnership (OEP) is a company formed by a number of business people in the county to help promote enterprise. The research also suggests Oxford has few self employed people, but that the working-age population were highly skilled. In South Oxfordshire, according to the Experian research, the situation was different, with the 11th highest proportion of those self employed in England. Mr Nigriello, who works for Unipart in Cowley, suggested the private sector should be willing to assist the public sector in making changes to their organisation. He said: "Private sector companies would be foolish not to help. "While we may be the engine that creates the wealth, we recognise that we need the services to create the community we want to live in". Oxfordshire County Council is currently looking to make more than Â£200m of cuts by 2015. The figure may be adjusted after the government's spending review next month. Meanwhile, the research also revealed Oxford is in the bottom five regions of the UK for GCSE results. South Today will be debating the issues raised in the spending review tonight at 2235 BST. BBC Oxford 95.2FM will be discussing the research from 0700 BST.	Private companies in Oxfordshire may not have enough capacity to employ people who lose their public sector jobs, an economics expert has warned.

BP described the withdrawal as a "precautionary measure", adding that it would monitor the security situation. The Foreign Office withdrew British embassy staff from the capital, Tripoli, last week. Gunmen have besieged the justice and foreign ministries recently, demanding that Gaddafi-era officials be expelled. The gunmen blocked the buildings two weeks ago, parking pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns outside. The siege was lifted by Sunday and employees at both ministries were back at work. Parliament passed a law last week barring Gaddafi-era officials from political office. BP said in a statement: "Following FCO advice given to us by the British Embassy in Tripoli, and purely as a precautionary measure, we have brought non-essential overseas staff out of Libya for the time being in a phased reduction of numbers. "Our Libyan staff remain and the office continues to operate. Fewer than a dozen people are affected. "We will continue to monitor the security situation and move people back in to Libya when it is considered safe to do so." On Friday, the Foreign Office said some embassy staff in Libya had been withdrawn in response to "ongoing political uncertainty". It said it was temporarily withdrawing a "small number" who work with Libyan ministries, while the UK embassy remains "open as usual", including for consular and visa services. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli and against all travel to other parts of Libya, such as the eastern city of Benghazi.	Oil giant BP has withdrawn some non-essential staff from operations in Libya following UK government advice about uncertainty in the country.
The union Unite organised the rally at the firm's headquarters in Derbyshire. The union has called for an end to "Victorian working practices" and demanded staff get a living wage of Â£7.85 an hour. Sports Direct said casual workers receive holiday and sick pay, and are included in incentive schemes. The protest at the company headquarters was one of about 40 being held on Wednesday, with Sports Direct shops across the country also being targeted. A Sports Direct spokeswoman said: "Much of the comment around the group's use of zero hours has been unfounded and inaccurate. "The group complies fully with all legal requirements which relate to casual workers, including holiday and sick pay and freedom to gain other employment. "Casual workers also benefit from general incentive schemes." Unite said an estimated 3,000 workers are on zero-hour contracts at Sports Direct's Shirebrook headquarters. A further 75% of staff across its UK stores are also on zero-hour contracts, with Sports Direct accounting for a fifth of all such contracts in the retail sector, according to Unite. One institutional investor, Royal London Asset Management, earlier called for the resignation of Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley citing anger on his failure to attend four board meetings. Ashley Hamilton Claxton from Royal London Asset Management, said: "We have lost confidence in the board and are very concerned about the long list of corporate governance failings that have not been addressed." But both Mr Ashley and Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell were re-elected to the board at the meeting. Unite representative Cheryl Pidgeon said: "We want an end to zero-hour contracts - because young people cannot stand 'forever and a day' to be on zero-hour contracts. "We think Sports Direct makes enough money to ensure that their workers have to dignity, respect and fair wages."	A Dickensian-style protest has been held to oppose Sports Direct's use of zero-hour contracts at the company's annual general meeting.
"And on the Monday there was no one there. There was a complete hush, it was extraordinary," says Mr Haynes who used to work on the floor of the London Stock Exchange, and is now chief executive of the trading venue Aquis Exchange. The Monday he's referring to was 30 years ago. It was the day of the Big Bang - when, in one fell swoop, the City of London was deregulated, revolutionising its fortunes and turning it into a financial capital to rival New York. London's switch in 1986 from traditional face-to-face share dealing to electronic trading helped it outpace its European competitors and became a magnet for international banks. Even if London now loses access to the single market, many believe the Big Bang's legacy is a financial infrastructure with foundations too deep to be moved. But many also say it sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis. There were three key elements to the Big Bang revolution: By ending fixed commissions Big Bang allowed more competition; by ending the separation of dealers and advisors it allowed mergers and take-overs; and by allowing in foreign owners it opened London's market to international banks. Coupled with the new magic of electronic trading - the City jumped from the 19th Century to the threshold of the 21st. It is generally thought that Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister drove through Big Bang as part of a programme of deregulation, but there were already powerful forces at work. By the early 1980s the competition authorities were threatening to take the stock exchange to the Restrictive Practices Court. Nicholas Goodison, then chairman of the Stock Exchange, believed it would be better to pre-empt the lawyers and avoid being forced to tear up its rule book. In any case the world was already changing. The US had abolished fixed commissions in 1974, and in 1979 the Conservative government abolished exchange controls - triggering for many the UK's financial and economic rebirth. "And there were other developments," says David Buik, now a market commentator at Panmure Gordon. "You have to remember that LIFFE (the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) had started up in 1982 and already attracted the big American and Japanese banks - not to mention the privatisations of British Gas, British Airways and so on." In the end it was Mr Goodison, Trade and Industry Secretary Cecil Parkinson, and Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who persuaded Mrs Thatcher to back the reforms that changed the City for ever. City traders were then strictly divided into two; jobbers and brokers. Brokers liaised with clients and then gave their orders to jobbers who did the actual trading, face-to-face in "open outcry", on the exchange floor. Up until 1967 trading was done at the old Capel Court exchange, known as The House, where "waiters" would water the floors with watering cans to keep down the dust. Nowadays the pre-Big Bang City has a bowler hat image, where a good lunch and long friendships were more important than profit. But it wasn't all like that, according to Brian Winterflood, later the founder of Winterflood Securities, who had been a jobber at Greener Dreyfus since the 1950s. "We had lunch but we never stopped trading," he said in a 1990 interview. "If we were too busy for lunch we wouldn't go to lunch, and you'd snatch a half an hour now and again." Crucially for the subsequent development of London as an international financial centre, the Big Bang produced a free-for-all, as brokers, jobbers and the City's traditional merchant banks merged. Some were bought by UK clearing banks but many more were snapped up by much bigger US, European and Japanese banks. The 300 member firms of the stock exchange had all been domestic - but within a year 75 were foreign-owned. With this came electronic trading, cutting costs as the competition increased. The jobbers vanished and the trading floor became deserted. All this meant that the volume of trade that flooded through the new terminals soared, averaging more than $7.4bn a week after Big Bang compared with $4.5bn a week beforehand. And costs also came down. "When I started out it cost a fortune to trade, the spreads between buying and selling were huge. Now you can trade on your mobile phone for a fiver," says Mr Haynes. It is said that Big Bang created 1,500 millionaires. Some 95% of the firms had been owned by partnerships, and dazzled by the massive sums on offer many sold up and retired. It also changed the geography of London. Until then the Bank of England had insisted that all of London's banks had to be within 10 minutes' walking distance of the governor's office so, it was said, in a crisis he could summon the lords of finance to his parlour with half an hour's notice. But the Securities and Investments Board (later the Financial Services Authority) replaced the Bank's regulatory role. On the day of Big Bang an advertisement in the Financial Times promised a new financial centre, three miles to the east of the City at Canary Wharf, which would "feel like Venice and work like New York". Yet not everything went to plan. In the short term there was a problem of massive overcapacity. The banks found they had overspent. The following years saw them closing down venerable firms like Vickers da Costa, Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee, Fielding Newson-Smith, Wood Mackenzie; names that now appear only in history books and at the bottom of senior financiers' resumes. By 1992 Canary Wharf was forced into bankruptcy as it struggled to find tenants. But in the 1990s and 2000s, profits, salaries and bonuses boomed. Even Canary Wharf recovered and thrived. The result was a financial sector many believe is Brexit-proof. "The banks built a huge infrastructure in technology, transport, education and telecoms, and that infrastructure is unique," says Mr Haynes. "People who say we are going to move off to Paris or Frankfurt don't understand you can't build an infrastructure like that overnight. It can't be rebuilt quickly just anywhere in the world." But with the wealth came something more ambiguous, and dangerous - a change of attitude.  "It became much more of a dog-eat-dog environment," says David Buik. "In the old days you would have been very careful to look after your client, you had a relationship. But it became a competition on rate and pricing. And the earnings became colossal." Much of this was based around a bonus culture which rewarded the best deal, while short-term trumped long-term. Some people understood better than others what was happening. David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit but went on to be a Conservative minister, co-authored a paper for Mrs Thatcher on the likely impact of the Big Bang. He expressed concern about "unethical behaviour" and that financial deregulation could lead to "boom and bust" But he concluded while there might be "individual financial failures" he did not expect "a systemic problem". On this he was wrong. The 2008 financial collapse was systemic. It prompted a new wave a regulation, trimming some of the City's freedoms. However, no one, save perhaps the odd elderly broker, dozing now in his Surrey mansion, would dream of returning to the days of bowler hats when the waiters watered the floors in Capel Court.	"I was used to the hustle and bustle, the crowd on the floor," says Alasdair Haynes.
His lawyer Brian Webber told the AFP news agency that a decision over his early release has been referred back to the parole board. The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. He has been fighting a lengthy battle to be released early from jail. Pistorius was due to be released in August, but remained in prison after Justice Minister Michael Masutha made a last-minute intervention blocking it. The parole review board - the final recourse for parole disputes - met on Monday to decide if the star, 28, should be allowed out on house arrest. A definitive parole ruling is now unlikely to be made before the athlete in a separate legal process appeals against his conviction on 3 November in Bloemfontein. This ruling could result in him receiving a longer prison term. Mr Webber explained that the parole review board decided to refer the matter back to the original parole panel - the body accused by Mr Masutha of "prematurely" wanting to release him in August. There will not be much sympathy for Pistorius because many people felt that the judge erred by acquitting him of murder. The double amputee will have to remain behind bars because while his case joins the lengthy queue of other parole hearings that need to be heard, and there is no indication when this will happen. Legal experts say the decision by the justice minister Michael Masutha to intervene was correct in terms of the law. At the time of his intervention, Pistorius had been granted parole only six months into his five-year sentence. The law states clearly that an offender can only be considered for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence, in this case 10 months. But because he has now served one-sixth of his sentence, he probably should be released by now. Prosecutors argue that the judge who presided over his trial did not apply the law correctly by acquitting him of murder. The judge instead found him guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter. Reeva Steenkamp's parents are strongly against Pistorius' possible release, telling an Australian TV channel in August that the Paralympian has ruined their lives. "He killed her. He admits he killed her. She's dead. Why didn't he just let her walk away? Why?" Reeva's mother June Steenkamp asked in the interview.	Oscar Pistorius must remain in jail and not be transferred to house arrest after a decision to grant him parole was again delayed.

He had trained with Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith at Huntingdon Gym, but believes returning home will improve his Olympic prospects. "It will open a lot of doors for me," the former British senior squad member told BBC Look East. MacKenzie is a European junior team gold medallist with Britain and finished second in the vault and sixth in the all-around at last year's national championships. He has also represented the senior squad at national level, but the prospect of competing for Team GB at major international events was being restricted by the country's world-class roster, with Smith, Max Whitlock, Sam Oldham, Kristian Thomas and Dan Keatings all rivals for selection. "I would say I feel more South African than British," said MacKenzie, who was born in the coastal town of Jeffreys Bay. "I won a competition for GB in South Africa in 2010. I remember standing up there on the podium with the British anthem playing and thought it didn't quite feel right. "I've been here 11 years. I have a British passport, but I can't really forget I was born in Africa and my parents were. I can't forget my heritage that quickly." MacKenzie has already made an impact on South African gymnastics, winning a Commonwealth Games qualifier in October to secure his place at Glasgow this summer and, under the British flag, finished highest at the 2013 national championships. And he will compete in the Africa championships at the end of March, in the hope of making the qualifying scores needed to become the first South African artistic gymnast to go to the Olympics since 1956. MacKenzie, who is now based at the Centurion Gymnastics Centre, intends to continue working with his Huntingdon coach Paul Hall and will send videos of his progress to receive tuition. "I can really make a difference to gymnastics as a whole there and maybe kickstart something," he said. "I can see what Louis Smith has done for the sport in this country and he's a great role model. I think it's definitely an achievable ambition to win the African champs, but there will be stiff competition."	British gymnast Cameron MacKenzie has chosen to represent South Africa in a bid to qualify for Rio 2016.
The route between Edinburgh and Tweedbank had been hit by delays and cancellations. ScotRail apologised for the problems and said buses had been organised to supplement the trains that could run.

Services on the Borders Railway are "running as normal" after severe disruption due to signalling problems.
Officials said the attack happened at the Europa shopping centre in the capital Minsk. Eyewitnesses spoke of a masked man chasing terrified shoppers on Saturday evening. Police later arrested the 18-year-old suspect. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. "When he took out a chainsaw, shoppers first thought it was some kind of game," police spokesman Alexander Lastovsky told Reuters. "Then he cut one woman badly with the chainsaw and hit her with a hammer. She died. He also attacked others." The injured woman was taken to a local hospital. The attacker had brought the chainsaw and the axe to the shopping centre in a guitar case.	A young man has attacked people with a chainsaw and an axe at a shopping centre in Belarus, killing one woman and injuring another.
European Space Propulsion (ESP) Limited blamed disappointing sales for going into liquidation. Formed by Aerojet Rocketdyne in 2012, it operated from missile maker Thales UK's factory in Castlereagh. Its offices were opened by the former First Minister Peter Robinson. He had expressed delight the US company had selected Belfast as its European sales base. But it never got near its projected Â£13m annual turnover. A spokesman for the firm said: "We had high hopes, just like the Northern Ireland ministers did. "We thank them for their support but unfortunately expected sales just never materialised." As recently as December, then Economy Minister Jonathan Bell talked of ESP as having "brought significant benefits to Northern Ireland". Employee numbers never got above eight.

The crash happened outside Castle Bytham, south of Grantham, on Wednesday afternoon. The 73-year-old pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, is being treated for back and leg injuries. A 52-year-old tanker driver was treated for minor injuries and the 61-year-old occupant of the property was unhurt. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has said it is aware of the incident and is making inquiries. Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue said the man who lives in the bungalow was in the garden and pushed the tanker driver out of the way, to prevent them both being hit. The pilot became stuck in the plane, which was embedded in the building, and the aircraft's landing gear broke off and landed on a bed. A police guard remains in place at the bungalow while recovery work is carried out. Pete Wiles, from the fire service, said: "If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit. "It's a fairly miraculous escape... there's an overhead power line nearby which it missed as well."	An investigation into how a small plane narrowly avoided two men and then struck a bungalow on a farm in Lincolnshire is continuing.

Highways England say the Â£6m layout changes on the Posthouse roundabout proved more difficult than anticipated. Work began last summer and was expected to finish by March but it has now been pushed back to 28 June. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said the route was vital to the region's economy. "Deadlines were set, missed, then extended, not once but again and again - and the level of information given to motorists has been very poor indeed," he said. New Chester MP Chris Matheson added: "The chaos these works have caused has been a real issue for Chester for months." A Highways England spokesperson said: "We are doing everything we can to complete the A55/A483 scheme as quickly as possible. "We have rescheduled the street lighting installation work to take place overnight in July, so that we are able to fully open the roundabout and start operating the traffic lights from Monday 29 June."	MPs are demanding highways officials explain why roadworks on the A55 and A483 on the Chester-Wrexham border have over-run, causing months of frustration and long hold-ups for motorists.
Parents of brides cannot invite more than 500 guests, and the number has been limited to 400 for grooms. The government also said that no more than seven main dishes can be served to "ensure that there is no wastage of any food items". An MP has also proposed a bill to impose a similar ban on expensive weddings across India. Weddings are expensive in Kashmir, and the traditional feast, locally called Wazwan, includes a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The state government said the order, which comes into effect from 1 April, was issued in response to public complaints about extravagance, waste and intrusive noise. The state had imposed a similar ban in 1984, but it was revoked after protests. Marriages are costly in other parts of India as well, and many people spend lavishly on food, clothes and entertainment. In November, the five-day wedding of businessman and former Karnataka state minister G Janardhana Reddy's daughter, Brahmani, with an estimated cost of about 5bn rupees ($74m; £59m), prompted outrage as millions of Indians struggled with a cash flow crisis. Among the extravagances were gold-plated invitation cards fitted with LCD screens, costing 10m rupees. Here are a few of the world's most expensive weddings:	The government in Indian-administered Kashmir has put curbs on excessively lavish weddings.
Another six people died when a minibus was hit elsewhere in Donetsk. No children were apparently hurt when the school playground was shelled but a biology teacher and a parent were among the dead, witnesses told Reuters. The school is 4km (2.5 miles) from Donetsk airport, where rebels have clashed with Ukrainian troops. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in eastern Ukraine since 5 September but the truce has frequently been violated. Both sides blamed the other for Wednesday's attacks. The Kiev-controlled regional administration said rebels from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) had opened fire with a multiple-launch rocket system. But DPR deputy leader Andrei Purgin told Russian TV that Ukrainian rocket launchers had targeted residential areas from as far as 40km (25 miles) away. Pro-Russian separatists control of much of Donetsk and have launched several attempts to capture the airport to the north-west of the city in recent weeks. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters the airport was still under government control but rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko told news agencies it would be fully captured in two to three days. Open conflict began in the east in April, after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists then declared independence in the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pupils in Donetsk only returned to school on Wednesday after the start of the school year was postponed by a month because of the fighting. Many children had been moved to safer areas while the fighting was at its heaviest, but although clashes have continued since the ceasefire was declared, the violence has been less widespread. Well over 200 people were at school number 57 in the Kievsky district when the playground was shelled, including 70 children. Although the school's windows shattered, none of the children was reported hurt. Another shell hit a minibus at a bus stop a few streets away from the school and a Reuters reporter described seeing six bodies inside the vehicle. The BBC's James Coomarasamy, visiting another school in Donetsk, says far fewer pupils than normal were present for the first day of the year, with the constant echo of artillery in the distance. "The first thing we should teach our pupils is to love their country and the city they live in and that they should respect the people around them," an English teacher said. On his first day as Nato Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg described the crisis in Ukraine as a major challenge to security and reiterated his predecessor's strong stance towards Russia. The Kremlin has denied sending heavy weapons and soldiers to help the rebels but admits that "volunteers" have gone to fight in eastern Ukraine. "We have to see that Russia changes its behaviour and its actions and returns to compliance with international law and its obligations," he said. Only a strong Nato could build a constructive relationship with Russia, he added. The European Commission has written a letter warning Russian President Vladimir Putin not to impose new trade barriers on Ukraine. As part of a compromise agreed earlier this month, the government in Moscow agreed it would not change its trade provisions with Ukraine if an EU-Ukraine trade accord was put on hold for 15 months. Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso says a recently adopted Russian decree contravenes that compromise.	A shell has killed four people at a school in the rebel-held east Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on the first day of classes, officials and witnesses say.
The Briton finished more than two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska in Nottwil, Switzerland. Storey can win a 17th title when she rides in Saturday's road race. "It's a massive relief to win," said the 37-year-old, who is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro. Storey is Britain's most decorated female Paralympian with 22 medals. She has won 11 gold, eight silver and three bronze medals in both cycling and swimming across six Paralympics. She won four golds at the 2012 Games in London and has now won 21 world titles across both sports. Storey began her sporting career in the pool, winning six medals at the 1992 Paralympics before switching to cycling in 2005.	Dame Sarah Storey claimed the 16th world title of her cycling career with gold in the time trial at the Para-cycling Road World Championships.
Legally, it needs at least 5% of local electors for a referendum to go ahead. Those behind the petition say a mayor would offer more dynamic leadership and "rise above party politics". Council leader Tim Warren said it felt "unnecessary" so soon after the elections. If successful, a directly elected mayor would replace him. The council announced on Monday that it had received 6,818 valid signatures. A further 2,789 signatures were ruled to be invalid. Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Bath & North East Somerset Council said the threshold set out under the 2000 Act had been reached and "it is anticipated that the referendum will be held early next year". In Bath, the council is run by a leader and cabinet system. Philip Raby, one of the team working for a referendum, said they favoured holding it on 5 May 2016, the day of the police and crime commissioner elections. He felt a directly elected mayor would offer "visible and accountable leadership" for the wider area - something he felt the current system did not offer. Mr Warren said there were "challenging budgetary issues" to concentrate on and questioned whether there was much public appetite for a referendum. Local petitions sparked referendums which resulted in elected mayors in Salford, Greater Manchester in 2012 and in Copeland, Cumbria in 2015. The Localism Act 2011 allowed central government to trigger referendums for elected mayors - but of the ten held in May 2012, only Bristol voted in favour of getting a mayor.	A referendum on an elected mayor for Bath and North East Somerset will be held in 2016, after a petition reached the threshold of 6,437 votes.
At one point in his final round of 67, Ramsay looked like he might take his challenge to the wire, closing to within a single shot of the eventual champion, Alex Noren, following a run of four straight birdies  in his opening six holes. He said he stood on the 10th tee believing for the first time in his life that he could win a title that he says would mean almost as much to him as a major championship. Not enough putts dropped on the back nine - he gave himself multiple opportunities - and he had to settle for the consolation prize of a slot in The Open. Ramsay asked about Andy Murray in the aftermath and called the now two-time Wimbledon champion an inspiration. "Watching Andy play at Wimbledon this week, watching Jamie play, those guys are huge inspirations for Scottish people," he said. "To win Wimbledon is a massive achievement and I think sometimes we take that for granted, we forget how good he is. "It's great watching him, because he's Scottish and because he's got that grit and fire. I love that attitude. For me, every week is about trying to be the best I can be. "When I'm 60, I want to sit in my chair watching the golf and be able to say that I won X number of tour titles and that I couldn't squeeze any more out of the talent I had. Talent is great, but if you don't have that hard work ethic, you're not to get anywhere." Ramsay has won three times on tour, the most recent of them being the Trophee Hassan in March last year. He's played in The Open five times, missing the cut on three occasions. His best finish was 58th at Muirfield in 2013. He was tied for 68th at St Andrews last year. His performance here rather came out of the blue. Ramsay finished sixth in China in May, but his form since then has been poor, his best finish a 43rd. His season had been a grind up until Castle Stuart. "I just loved it out there," he said. "I didn't come out with a tentative attitude, which has sometimes been my fault in the past. I hit some great shots. "I knew, standing on that 10th tee, that I could win the tournament and that's a great feeling. I just have to take that into the next year and see if I can get this title in the bag one of these years. "From a confidence point of view, I will think to myself that I had a chance to win a huge tournament. You're halfway there when you believe you can do it. I know I have a lot more in the tank." Castle Stuart didn't get the champion it wanted, with due credit to the excellent Noren, but it was a terrific host venue. The troubling aspect - and it's reflective of golf's serious problem - was the size of the crowd on each of the four days. The total attendance for Thursday-Sunday was 41,809. The final round brought the smallest number of fans - 8,733 - of the week. There was a Murray effect there for sure. But it's a much wider issue than that. Last year at Gullane, the Scottish brought in a total crowd of 63,000, which was, in turn, less than the 65,833 that attended the year before at Royal Aberdeen. The small numbers this time are partly on account of geography but also to do with golf's diminishing attraction as a spectator sport. None of that bothered Noren, of course. Nor Ramsay. If there was a competition to find the widest smile at Castle Stuart last night, the two of them would have been locked in a dead heat.	Richie Ramsay didn't win the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, but he wore a contented smile none the less having played himself into the top-six and securing himself a place in The Open Championship at Royal Troon later this week.
Reports of a "mass murder" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. "It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. "Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable." Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a "personal life crisis". In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: "There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. "We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised." Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. "Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context." But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.	The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?

"Like every young Welsh boy I want to play for Wales, but when it actually comes round you get that sensation of pride."

Bath and North East Somerset (Banes) Council said a pay dispute between the Unite union and the contractor Kier was over following successful talks.

Further planned strikes by waste collection workers around Bath have been called off.
These are two of the questions up for debate at a new exhibition at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. From ancient Brythonic warlord to mythical chivalric king with a court anywhere from Wales to Glastonbury or as far north as Scotland - it is hard to separate myth, legend and fact. According to curator Dr Maredudd ap Huw, these unknowns lie at the heart of King Arthur's enduring appeal. "The beauty of Arthur is that he was - indeed, according to some 'is' - whoever you want him to be," said Dr ap Huw. "There is some early evidence to suggest that there was an Arthur in the 4th or 5th Centuries. "Though in all likelihood he was very far removed from the romantic depictions of (writers) Thomas Malory and Alfred, Lord Tennyson." However, just how Welsh he would have been is a "moot point", Dr ap Huw added. Before the Saxons drove the Brythonic people (Celtic Britons) west and north, there was no recognised entity of an independent Wales, making his nationality hard to ascertain. The exhibition brings together all the crucial texts which have informed our perception of Arthur for more than a millennium. One of the exhibits is the 13th Century Book of Aneirin, which includes a 6th Century poem describing a battle near what is now Catterick in North Yorkshire. Dr ap Huw said one reference in it is extremely telling. A young Brythonic hero called Gwawrddur is described as fighting valiantly against the Saxons "although he was no Arthur". "It is possible to infer (from this) that the legend of Arthur as a fearsome warlord was already well-established by the 6th Century," Dr ap Huw added. But the man who drew all the threads together and introduced Arthur's wife Guinevere, his sword Excalibur and the Knights of the Round Table was Geoffrey of Monmouth. Dr ap Huw describes the 12th Century writer as "the most influential author in the history of Wales". "Forget Dylan Thomas, what Geoffrey wrote had a far more profound impact on world thinking and the perception of Arthur as a Welsh hero," he said. "Writing in Latin, his ideas rapidly spread throughout Europe, and via Chretien De Troyes, fed into the French-Norman ideals of chivalric kingship. "Geoffrey claimed as his source an ancient Welsh manuscript which was then lost, never to be found.  Read into that what you will, but what is certainly true to say is that it is still essentially Geoffrey's version of King Arthur which we are taught as children, right up to the present day." Arthur's castle Camelot and other characters such as the wizard Merlin are then referenced in the 13th Century Black Book of Carmarthen. There he is described as "a war veteran who has lost his wits in battle in Scotland, and has developed the gift of being able to talk to animals". But it was not until the 15th and 16th Century that "Arthur Mania" reached its heights after William Caxton published Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. While Geoffrey of Monmouth set Camelot in the former Roman stronghold of Caerleon, near Newport, Malory anchored it as a thoroughly English tale. So much so that King Henry VII named his eldest son Arthur in honour of the legend. By 1534, Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia had debunked much of Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, and cast doubt on the very existence of a historical Arthur at all. "Virgil's account wasn't wholly accepted. John Prise - a lawyer for Thomas Cromwell - published a rebuttal in defence of Arthur, but by then the historiographic interest in Arthur was already fatally damaged. "That's not to say we'd forgotten about him altogether. Edmund Spencer's Faerie Queene drew heavily on Arthurian tradition and, when it was presented to Queen Elizabeth I in 1590, she was so delighted that she awarded him a pension of Â£50 a year for life," Dr ap Huw said. "But by then Arthur had become a Britannia or Gloriana-type figurehead for a nation. "The historical Arthur was deadâ€¦though there are some who say he never died, and is simply waiting to wake again when his country needs him."	Who was King Arthur and how Welsh was he?
Seven-year-old Yamato Tanooka was found in a military training base near Shikabe in Hokkaido, just a few kilometres from where he was left. His parents initially said he had got lost, but eventually admitted briefly abandoning him for being naughty. His father has apologised to his son and rescuers, saying "we went too far". How did Yamato survive? The lost boy and Japanâ€™s parenting debate World media draw lessons "My excessive act forced my son to have a painful time," Takayuki Tanooka said in an emotional news briefing outside Hakodate hospital, 30km (19 miles) south, where the boy was taken for checks. "I deeply apologise to people at his school, people in the rescue operation, and everybody for causing them trouble," he said. "I have poured all my love into my son, but from now on, I would want to do more, together with him. I would like to protect him while he grows up. Thank you very much." Search teams including the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) have been combing the remote area, home to brown bears, for nearly a week. They had found no trace of Yamato and hopes were fading. But shortly before 08:00 on Friday morning (23:00 GMT on Thursday) he was found inside a building at the SDF base about 4km (2.5 miles) from where he was left. "One of our soldiers was preparing for drills this morning and opened the door of a building on the base, and there he was," an SDF member told NHK. "When he asked 'are you Yamato?' the boy said, 'Yes'. Then he said he was hungry, so the soldier gave him some water, bread and rice balls." It appears rescuers came tantalisingly close to finding him four days ago. The SDF said the base had been searched on Monday but no trace was seen of the boy, who says he reached the hut on Saturday. The soldier who found him was not part of the search team. NHK said Yamato had told rescuers he "walked through the mountains" until he found the shelter. He was taken to hospital by a medical helicopter. A doctor later said he was in very good condition, despite only having had water during his six-day ordeal. At Yamato's school in Hokuto, near Hakodate, his fellow pupils shouted for joy when it was announced at assembly that he was safe, the Japan Times reports. Yamato's parents initially said he got lost while they were foraging for vegetables, along with their daughter.  But they later admitted they had driven off, briefly leaving him alone on a mountain road as a punishment for throwing stones earlier. When they returned to collect him shortly afterwards, he had disappeared, they said. He was wearing jeans and a t-shirt at the time, Reuters news agency reported. Police have said the parents could face charges for negligence. The case has gripped Japan, sparking discussions about acceptable levels of discipline for children.	A boy missing in remote woods in Japan since Saturday after being left alone by his parents as punishment has been found alive and well.
Media playback is not supported on this device A report into claims of bullying said British Cycling "lacked good governance" at board level. Cookson, who led the organisation for 17 years before becoming UCI president, said: "If there was a lacking, I think we all share in that responsibility." He added British Cycling had been scrutinised by UK Sport. Asked if he was "pinning the blame" on the funding agency, he said: "As I understand it, they were closely involved in how things were managed and monitored. "I'm not trying to dodge any of my responsibility. What I'm saying is there were other people with responsibilities as well." The Phelps report into the culture of Britain's cycling team criticised former technical director Shane Sutton and UK Sport, and noted a "culture of fear" existed within the team, according to many staff members. "I don't accept there was a culture of fear and I spent a lot of time at the National Cycling Centre," said Cookson, who is seeking re-election after joining the UCI in 2013. However, he said Sutton should have been moved following recommendations from the King Review in 2012. "One of the recommendations was that Shane be moved out of direct coaching with athletes," he said. "As far as I understood in the first half of 2013, that was one of those action-plan elements that was implemented and it was after that in the middle of 2013 I became a candidate and then was elected to the UCI presidency." Australian Sutton stayed on before resigning last year amid claims of sexism and was later found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish, though he was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him. Media playback is not supported on this device Cookson defended his record at British Cycling, saying: "I'm not making any excuses for my behaviour. I think we made incredible progress and some great achievements. "The idea we had no respect for athlete welfare is wrong. The relationship between athletes and coaches was something we were concerned about from time to time. Action was taken." And he disagrees with MP Damian Collins, who has called for board members from the period covered in the investigation to resign. "My former colleagues at British Cycling have been committed to their sport over many years. Many of them are good people who have worked very hard," Cookson said. UK Anti-Doping is also investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Team Sky and British Cycling, which both deny. "The reputational problems that have been around that team in the past few months have not been helpful. I want to wait for the outcome of UK Anti-Doping's enquiries," he said. Cookson said cycling had made significant progress in the battle against cheating during his tenure at the UCI. "We were previously considered pariahs in the anti-doping world. Now we have one of he best reputations in sport, I believe," he added. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Brian Cookson wants to be re-elected later this year for a second term as president of cycling's world governing body, and sees a fresh mandate as his future. However, his past is catching up with him. After a 17-year period as the president of British Cycling many believe it's under his tenure that the rot set in within the organisation, a fact addressed and criticised in the recent Phelps review. Cookson doesn't shirk responsibility for some of the major welfare issues that have occurred within British Cycling. But what is striking is that he refuses to accept wholesale blame. In my interview with him, he points the finger firmly at UK Sport, saying one of their officials was embedded within the world-class cycling programme at the Manchester velodrome and was involved in management and monitoring. Any "lacking" must be shared, he believes. His message is, in effect: 'Why should the blame fall only on my shoulders?' Shane Sutton, according to the 2012 King report, should have been moved away from direct coaching with athletes. We now know he referred to disabled cyclists as "gimps and wobblies" in addition to his role in Jess Varnish's departure from the British team. But Cookson points to the fact he moved in 2013 to be president of the UCI and, in his absence, Sutton carried on working with cyclists unimpeded and with serious consequences. Again, Cookson's overarching message is clear: nothing to do with me, guv.	Brian Cookson, the head of cycling's world governing body, says blame for British Cycling's failings should not rest solely with him.
Hillingdon Council's leader said it would provide funding to challenge it for "however long it takes to win this battle". Wandsworth, Richmond and Hillingdon councils spent £300,000 from their general funds on legal action. Windsor and Maidenhead Council spent £50,000 from its development fund. The details were obtained using Freedom of Information laws. Council general funds are where money for most council services is drawn, with funds raised from council tax and central government grants. The four councils failed in an attempt to challenge the decision to build the runway at the High Court in January. London Councils, the body that represents London local authorities, says that by 2020 there will be a budget gap of around £2bn in London local government, which council budgets will have to accommodate. Hillingdon Council has set aside a contingency budget of £200,000 for possible future legal action against the third runway, while Wandsworth has budgeted £25,000. The case against the runway brought by the councils was struck out by Mr Justice Cranston in January on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim, but further legal action against the runway may take place. John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, questioned whether the councils were making the right spending decisions. "Those are huge sums of taxpayers' money spent on legal fees which could have otherwise gone towards road maintenance or adult social care," he said. "Given that Hillingdon residents have seen their council tax rise by over 45% in real terms over the last 20 years, the decision to allocate so much money for further action raises serious questions over the council's priorities. "Many residents may well oppose the third runway, but they are free to form groups to launch legal action themselves." Stan Woods, a resident of Longford, which will be demolished to make room for the third runway, feels there is little the councils can do to affect the outcome. "I worked at Heathrow for 38 years, so can see the reason for expansion, but equally wish I could keep my home," he said. "I guess the councils feel they are acting on behalf of their communities, but to be honest this decision will be taken higher up the political ladder." Councillor Raymond Puddifoot, leader of Hillingdon Council, said it was time the government stopped "wasting time and money" and turned its attention to finding a "workable alternative" to Heathrow. "The government spent more than £3.8 million of taxpayers' money on the expansion of Heathrow Airport in the 18 months between July 2015 and December 2016, and this figure has risen dramatically over the last few months and will continue to do so," he said. "We will continue provide both the funding and the integrity necessary to both defend and represent our residents for however long it takes to win this battle."	Four councils under Heathrow Airport's flight path spent £350,000 on legal fees challenging the planned third runway, the BBC has learnt.
The 23-year-old midfielder is his country's joint all-time goalscorer, with two goals from 11 caps. He ended last season on loan at Forest Green and is the second Gibraltar international to represent Torquay, after goalkeeper Jamie Robba. "He is a very talented player who has experienced a bit of a plateau in his career," said boss Kevin Nicholson. "It is those kinds of players that thrive in our environment and if we can get the best out of him, then we will be in a good place and so will he."

Cardiff-based SA Brain bought the chain Coffee #1 last year. It comes as new figures show Brains' sales are up nearly 4% in its pubs. Brains believes there is potential in the coffee market and plans a chain of about 50 outlets over the next three years in south Wales and the south west of England. The family-run brewery employs about 2,000 people. Last year's profits are up 6% against what the company described as "a tough economic backdrop". In autumn 2011, Brains bought Coffee #1, which comprised 15 high street shops in south Wales and the south west of England, and since then, it has opened three more. Brains chief executive Scott Waddington said: "The research suggests that the coffee market is going to continue to grow at 5, 6, 7% for the next five years, which is pretty much what it's been doing for the last five years. "Coffee in the UK, despite more and more places opening, still has a long way to go to catch up with more developed markets, like the US." Equity analyst Sam Hart said Brains' decision to diversify into coffee shops was "probably partly a reflection of very tough conditions in the on-trade [bar and pub sales] beer market". "The on-trade is under pressure from a combination of pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, rising alcohol duties and the increased availability of relatively cheap beer at the supermarket chains," he added. Mr Hart said the growth in the coffee shop culture in the UK could be viewed as Americanisation. "Obviously coffee has been ingrained in culture in the US for many years and this appears to be spreading to the UK and other developed markets," he said. "Many people view coffee as an affordable luxury on which they are prepared to spend, despite pressures on their disposable incomes."	Wales' largest independent brewer is planning to open about 30 coffee shops over three years as it diversifies from its traditional pub business.
They said they had received an anonymous threat, two days after the killing of five police officers. A nearby parking lot was searched for a "suspicious person" but no-one was found. SWAT officers were earlier deployed at the main building. On Thursday, five white police officers were shot dead by a black man, Micah Johnson, during a protest rally. The march was against the killing of black men by police. Two deaths this week have led to nationwide protests. Dallas police said its officers - using dogs - searched the parking lot but the hunt turned up nothing. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the police said: "The Dallas Police Department received an anonymous threat against law enforcement across the city and has taken precautionary measures to heighten security." An armoured vehicle was moved close to the main HQ in central Dallas and heavily armed officers were seen nearby, according to the Associated Press news agency. But it added that members of the public were still able to walk about freely around the building. The police asked media to stop all live feeds around HQ "for the safety of our officers", the BBC's James Cook reports. The shooting happened late on Thursday during the protest march. Johnson, who was himself killed during the assault, supported black militant groups who encouraged violence against police. Dallas police chief David Brown said Johnson had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police. The attack came after the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Earlier on Saturday, President Barack Obama said the US was "not as divided as some have suggested" in the wake of the shootings involving African-Americans. He said Americans of "all races, all backgrounds", including many of those who were protesting, were outraged by the Dallas killings. As well as the five police officers killed, another seven were injured on Thursday. Two civilians were also hurt. Johnson, 25, who officials say acted alone, was killed by remotely detonated explosives that were sent into a car park where he had taken refuge after the shootings. He was a member of the US Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 who had served in Afghanistan. Bomb-making material, rifles and a combat journal were found in his home in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. A number of gun attacks involving police officers and civilians have occurred in other parts of the US in the aftermath of the deaths in Minnesota and Louisiana. Leaders of the Black Lives Matter organisation have condemned the Dallas killings but say planned marches, including a "Weekend of Rage" in Philadelphia, will go ahead.	Dallas police have given the all clear, hours after security levels were raised at their headquarters in the city.

The pair performed above their world ranking of 22nd to reach Tuesday's semi-final, losing to fourth seeds Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan of China. Langridge said: "When we got to 14-7 in the last game, I thought: 'We might win this! We are going to win this!'" He added: "Luckily Marcus was quite calm, which helped a lot." In a dramatic finale, a review on the final point was required to seal the victory. "I can't even describe how I felt after we saw that," said Ellis. "This is an incredible feeling. After how we performed in our very first match, we knew we could compete with anybody." Team GB have now won 52 medals in Rio.

Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in the town 11 days ago. Suffolk Police said the three young people aged between 16 and 18 were seen at Short Brackland at 04:20 BST on 24 September. They could be "potential witnesses", the force said. For updates on this story, visit BBC Suffolk Live Acting Supt Kim Warner appealed to the trio: "We appreciate that getting in touch with police may be intimidating but we do need to speak to you. "At this stage in the investigation we just need to talk to anyone who may have seen Corrie during his night out so we can build a picture." One of the teenagers is described as a white female, of quite slim build, wearing either a dark green or navy blue jumper-style top. The other two were both males, one wearing a hooded top. They were seen towards the back of Cornhill Walk shopping centre, police said. Acting Supt Warner added: "We need to find Corrie and a number of inquiries are being carried out to do this. "We know from CCTV images that we have already viewed that he engaged with a number of people during his evening out. "We have had several calls but still need to talk to anyone who may have seen him or spoken to him during the early hours." Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September. It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.	Police searching for a missing RAF serviceman want to trace three teenagers spotted in Bury St Edmunds on the day of his disappearance.
The four national football associations were unable to agree on sending Great Britain teams to Rio. Sampson, who led England to a bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup, described the situation as "frustrating". "I've watched the tournament and I believe this team would have won the gold medal," he said. "This group of players did earn the right to go to an Olympics and represent themselves and their country, but it's been taken away from them". England captain Steph Houghton, who scored three goals at London 2012 for Great Britain, added that it was "very disappointing" to not go to Rio. "That was originally our place - the place that we won at the World Cup, and it's hard, but at the same time there's no point about complaining we can't be there," she added. England's Football Association had put forward the idea of sending Great Britain teams to the Olympics, but Fifa said it would need the agreement of the ruling bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who were against it. Stewart Regan, the Scottish Football Association's chief executive, has been among those to voice concerns that a Great Britain team would threaten the separate status of the home nations at future international tournaments such as World Cups.	Great Britain could have won another Olympic gold had the women's football team been allowed to compete, believes England head coach Mark Sampson.
The men were believed to have been working on the northbound carriageway of the A361 at Gornhay Cross, Tiverton, when they were hit. One was flown to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, while a second Devon Air Ambulance flew the other man to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. The van driver has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. The condition of the two injured men, who are both in their 40s, is not known. Devon and Cornwall Police said a third man was hurt in the incident, but he is described as the "walking wounded". The Barnstaple-bound carriageway is expected to remain closed for several hours and diversions have been put in place.	Two road workers have been seriously hurt in an accident involving a van in mid Devon.
More than 20 people are being treated in hospital with burns and other injuries after the incident in the village of Hitrino, local media say. The authorities ordered an evacuation as firefighters battled the blaze. At least 20 buildings were damaged in the derailment and explosion, spokesperson Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's Nova television. Two tanks hit an electricity line and exploded when the train derailed near the village station at about 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), according to several reports. "Two blasts have caused a serious fire and ruined at least 20 buildings," Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Georgi Kostov told Reuters news agency. "There are many people injured... many with burns." Hitrino, a town of around 800 people, is located in Bulgaria's north-eastern Shumen province, about 60 miles (100km) from the Black Sea. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov said he was travelling to the village. In a post on social media, he said the regional hospital needed blood supplies to cope with the causalities, and appealed to people in the region to donate blood. Transport Minister Ivalyo Moskovski also said he was travelling to the village. In a brief statement, he said he had ordered both the head of the railway accident investigation task force and a representative of the rail infrastructure company to attend the scene.	A train carrying liquid petroleum gas has derailed and exploded in Bulgaria, killing at least four people.
The 24-year-old, who played 16 games on loan at Kilmarnock last season, will compete with James Tavernier. Hodson started his career at Watford and played 51 games in three seasons at MK Dons after a loan at Brentford. He joins new faces Matt Gilks, Clint Hill, Joey Barton, Niko Kranjcar, Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh Windass at Ibrox. Rangers paid an undisclosed fee for Hodson, who was part of Northern Ireland's squad at Euro 2016, but did not feature in any of their four matches.	Rangers have made right-back Lee Hodson their eighth summer signing on a three-year deal from MK Dons.
The first Championships took place in 1877 at the All England Club in London, where it's still held today. Wimbledon takes place over two weeks and it's the only major championship still played on grass. Here's your guide to the tournament... There are 128 places available in the draw for both men and women. Out of these 32 are ranked or seeded for the purposes of a draw. These seeded players are seen as the best players in the draw and they're kept apart so that they don't meet until later in the competition. In addition there are 16 qualifiers and eight wild cards, players who are given a chance to play even though their world rankings are low. The match is divided up into sets. In men's tennis you have to get three sets to win. For women it's two. To win a set you have to win six games - but you also have to get two more games than your opponent. So you can take the set 6-4, but not 6-5. In that case, you'd continue until someone won 7-5. If you get to 6-6 first, you play a tiebreak. The first person to get to seven points or more by two clear points wins the tiebreak and the set. To win a game you need to win four points. But rather than going up from one to four they go in this order: fifteen, thirty, forty, game. If you are tied on forty-all this is called deuce, and then you have to win by two clear points. The first Ladies' Championship was held in 1884, before that women weren't allowed to take part in Wimbledon. In 2007 women were granted the same amount of prize money as men. The Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Champions each receive Â£1.88m in 2015. Now, the only division between men's and women's tennis is the number of sets you have to get to win. Tennis was first played in France about 900 years ago - with people using the palms of their hands. No one really knows how the scoring started, but "deuce" is based on the French word "deux", meaning two, when two people are on the same points. 54,250 tennis balls are used during the Championships period. Yellow tennis balls were used for the first time in 1986. Traditionally Wimbledon fans eat strawberries and cream throughout the competition. A whopping 28,000 kg of strawberries and 7,000 litres of cream are supplied for each Wimbledon Championship. The fastest Wimbledon serve of all time was delivered by Taylor Dent in 2010 - it clocked an amazing 148mph! Seeds - The people expected to do well in a tournament. Set - The main sections of a tennis match (see how to score, above). Straight sets - When someone wins a match without losing a set, eg winning three sets to love. Love - A tennis word for zero. Forehand - When you hit with the palm of your hand facing to the front. Backhand - A shot with the  back of your hand facing front. Deuce - This is another way of saying forty-all. It comes from the French word "deux", meaning two, when two people are on the same point. Baseline - This is the line at the far end of the court. Cyclops - The machine that goes beep to tell if the ball has hit the net on a serve (which means the serve has to be taken again). Serve - When the player hits the ball over the net to start the game. Let - Play the point again. Tiebreak - When the set is drawn at six-all (see how to score, above). Ace - When a player wins a point after serving an unstoppable shot. Smash - A very fast shot hit by a player. Volley - Hitting the ball before it bounces. Double fault - Serving twice out of the court and losing the point. Umpire - The person who decides, like a referee. Spin - Hitting the ball so it spins and bounces so it's hard for the other player to hit (as in 'top spin', 'back spin').	The professional tennis season comprises of hundreds of tournaments around the world and one of the most prestigious is Wimbledon.
Both Jenny Rathbone and Mike Hedges are applying separately to take part in a ballot which, if they win, will allow them to propose a bill to ban the fees. Mr Hedges said the fees were a "tax" on some of society's poorest with students among the biggest hit. But one letting agent said a ban could hit efforts to professionalise the sector. The Welsh Government said it was happy to consider how such legislation might work. The charges have already been banned in Scotland, while the UK government is planning to consult on doing the same in England. There are currently no firm plans to do the same in Wales, although the Welsh Government has said it was "actively considering" the move. Ministers have faced criticism for not acting sooner. AMs from all of the assembly's opposition parties have supported a ban. Assembly members can propose bills - proposals for new laws which when passed by the assembly become acts - from outside the government through a random ballot process. Mr Hedges said: "They are a tax on some of the poorest people in society who are engaged in private rented accommodation." The Swansea East AM said it was a big problem in university cities and a "big problem anywhere where there is more demand for housing then there is housing". Mr Hedges believes that about 20 AMs may apply to take part in the ballot - although only Mr Hedges and Ms Rathbone are currently known to be proposing banning the fees. Cardiff Council AM Jenny Rathbone said Mr Hedges' attempt "doubles the chances of one of us being picked". Catherine Iannucci, 21, originally from Barry and studying her third year of history and politics at Cardiff University, lives in a house with six other tenants. She said they have had to pay Â£80 each to take the home off the market - amounting to a fee of Â£560 for the agency. Ms Iannucci, who is a part of the group Labour Students and has conducted research on agency fees for Ms Rathbone, said: "It's a significant amount of money. "We don't really know what they're for and we don't know what that's gone towards." She also had to pay a deposit of a month's rent, plus Â£50. "In the middle of term, because we look around February time - nobody has that money to just throw away easily. It does put you under a lot pressure for the rest of the term," she said. She said she would be in favour of a ban as long as it meant that rents did not go up as a result. Douglas Haig is the director for Wales and vice-chairman of the Residential Landlords Association - which also owns Cardiff property management company James Douglas Sales and Lettings. He said his firm does charge fees, adding: "There are fees that go to landlord, there are fees that go to the tenant." Mr Haig said he did not condone "sharp practices" in the sector but warned that banning fees may make it harder to professionalise the industry. "If we just outright ban fees, then we're going to have a number of consequences," he said. "The most important is around the professionalisation of the sector... If you are taking away money from the sector, that's going to be very difficult to continue providing quality. "I don't think the vast majority of agents out there are actually profiteering. "There are costs in running these businesses that people are unaware of and as increased state regulation comes in, those costs continue to rise." A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are happy to consider how legislation on this might work. "We want to look at the evidence from Scotland and see wider consultation to ensure that a ban on fees does not push rental costs up." The next scheduled ballot for backbench bills is on 25 January.	Letting agents' fees for tenants could be banned in Wales under proposals from two backbench Labour AMs.
Mrs Morgan has launched a consultation to replace a system she says is "outdated, inefficient and unfair". The funding shake-up will also remove local authorities from the process, with cash going directly to heads. Labour has accused the government of "dodging difficult questions" about who will lose funding in the changes. Mrs Morgan says schools need funding that "genuinely matches their need". She says the plans will ensure money goes "straight to the frontline", but it will mark a further reduction in the link between local authorities and schools. On Monday the education secretary has taken the next step towards introducing a new school funding formula in 2017-18, after complaints about local anomalies and spending gaps. For example, pupils in Rotherham each receive £500 per year more in funding than those in Plymouth, even though they have similar levels of disadvantage. In December, MPs led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart presented a petition calling for change, saying the best-funded areas received up to £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded received £4,200. The government has a manifesto pledge to create a more consistent way to distribute more than £40bn per year of the core schools budget - and says it wants to end funding rates based on "oddities of history". Further details were announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, with the promise of a national rate for each pupil, with extra funding for those with additional needs. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, backed the principle of a fairer redistribution of funding. He also supported a "big shift" in more money going directly to schools. But he warned that there would be both "winners and losers" under a new funding regime and there was still "scant detail" about how this would be decided. There have been warnings that some schools will lose out, particularly in inner London. Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the proposals would "impose huge funding cuts on many schools unless additional funding is made available. Schools are already suffering real terms cuts to per pupil funding". Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of a change to funding arrangements. "However simply redistributing the current pot of money is not enough on its own to address the significant real-terms cuts currently hitting school budgets. Greater investment is needed," said Mr Trobe. The Department for Education says the current system is out of date and no longer reflect levels of need. It says that in the past 10 years, the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals has doubled in Lincolnshire and nearly halved in Southwark. The education department says that for the new funding formula there will be a basic level of per pupil funding, with extra support allocated depending on need, such as high levels of deprivation or for schools in high-cost areas. For local authority schools, including the majority of primary schools, there will be a two year transition period, in which funding will cease to be distributed through councils. Councils will have a funding role in areas with "high-level special educational needs", but will no longer be involved as a channel for basic funding for schools. Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said:  "Councils know their areas best, and currently work in partnership with head teachers and governors to set local funding formula which allows local needs and priorities to be addressed. "We'd want to see this local conversation continue, rather than having all school budgets set in Whitehall." Academy schools and trusts already receive funding through the government's Education Funding Agency. Labour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell says that for a national funding formula "the devil will be in the detail" and claimed that the government was stalling on revealing where schools would have reduced levels of funding. She also warned that the overall schools budget would see a real-terms spending cut, which would have a "huge impact". But Mrs Morgan said the changes would provide a fairer allocation of resources. "We want every school in England to get the funding it deserves, so that all children - whatever their background and wherever they live in the country - get a great education."	Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is pushing ahead with a "national funding formula" for schools, to tackle uneven levels of funding across England.
Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane. About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips. The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme "Should we close our zoos?" "Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant," he told the BBC. "They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up." Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity. Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK. The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad. It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago. It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species. Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays. Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer. The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation. "[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments," said the president of Born Free, Will Travers. "A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide," he added. Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision. "They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree", he said.	A leading marketer of "responsible tourism" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.
The 32-year-old was released by the Paisley club after making more than 330 appearances over two stints. "He's played at the highest level in Scotland and is top flight quality," manager Ian Murray told the club website. "A player of his calibre opting to join us is a very good sign." A League Cup winner with the Buddies in 2013, Van Zanten, who also had spells at Hibs, Morton and Hamilton, made 18 appearances last season. Van Zanten is the Championship club's second summer signing, following Scott Taggart's move from Morton.	Former St Mirren full-back David van Zanten has joined Dumbarton on a one-year deal, with the option of staying for a further 12 months.
Scotland Yard said the 37-year-old was held at his home address under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are searching the property. He has been taken to a south London police station and is being questioned by officers from the counter terrorism command unit.	A man has been arrested in north-west London on suspicion of involvement in production of improvised explosive devices in Iraq in 2007.
Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found dead on a beach on the island of Koh Tao on Monday. British brothers Christopher and James Ware were questioned but police now say there is no evidence against them. Officers had said there was "strong evidence" against Burmese suspects, but now say there are no DNA matches. Forensic tests carried out on Ms Witheridge's body revealed traces of semen from two different men, neither of which matched DNA from Mr Miller, the Ware brothers or 11 Burmese people they have been questioning. Meanwhile, Thailand's prime minister has apologised after he appeared to suggest beautiful women in bikinis could not be safe. BBC south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head said police have admitted they "really don't know where to look now". He said investigators had several problems, including that the crime scene was not sealed off and people were not stopped from leaving Koh Tao after the killings. "The impression we got from a police press conference [on Thursday] was they haven't really made much progress at all," he added. He said police were looking for a group of men who were heard singing "Western pop songs" near the crime scene. Post-mortem examinations showed Ms Witheridge, from Hemsby in Norfolk, died from head wounds and Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from severe blows to the head and drowning. Police said Mr Miller also suffered wounds on his hands, which indicated a struggle had taken place. Their bodies were found close to the beach-side bungalows where they had been staying. A garden hoe believed to have been used in the attack was found nearby. Members of Ms Witheridge's family have arrived in Bangkok and had a meeting with Thailand's deputy police chief. British consul Michael Hancock said they were "deeply distressed" and it was "very important for the family" to speak directly to a senior police officer. Thailand's paradise island murder mystery The Ware brothers, believed to be from Jersey, were stopped at Bangkok International Airport as they prepared to leave the country. Police earlier said they were "possible suspects" but did not arrest them. Formally making people suspects is an official judicial process in Thailand. The BBC understands they have now been told they can leave Thailand. British freelance journalist Andrew Drummond, who lives in Bangkok, said the investigation seemed to have followed the "same pattern" as those into previous killings of Britons in Thailand, such as the unsolved murder of Kirsty Jones in 2000. "Police initially seem to always seek the foreigners or the immigrants as the main suspects and that certainly happened in this case," he said. "We've had a week of toing and froing between British suspects and Burmese immigrant suspects and now we find out that... the DNA doesn't match anybody." Speaking earlier this week, Thailand's prime minister appeared to suggest attractive women put themselves in danger by wearing certain clothes. "Can they be safe in bikinis... unless they are not beautiful?" he said. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a military coup in May, has since said: "I'm sorry that it [the comment] hurt people." Ms Witheridge's family described her as "a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman who poured joy into the lives of all who knew her". In a statement, Mr Miller's family said he was "hard-working, bright and conscientious, with everything to look forward to".	Thai police admit they are struggling to find the killers of two British tourists, after it emerged crime scene DNA did not match that of any suspect.
They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (Â£4.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. "Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out," he said. "Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie." It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. "With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world," film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and "lean, gritty" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the "brilliant" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. "I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home," said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. "South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre," she told BBC News from Seoul. "Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines." Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. "'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead'," wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the "best zombie movie" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. "When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better." However, he added: "For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake." On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.	Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.
Mr Johnson, who returned to the Commons at the election, told LBC he would be best placed to continue to fight expansion by staying in Parliament. The Conservative manifesto said the party would "take account" of the Davies Commission into runway options. The report, which has two Heathrow and one Gatwick options, is due next month. Mr Johnson has been an outspoken opponent of further expansion at Heathrow. He told LBC that if it did go ahead there would have to be a new congestion charge zone around it to tackle the traffic and pollution caused. Fellow Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith has pledged to quit the party and force a by-election if the Conservatives - who scrapped Labour plans for a third runway in 2010 - complete a U-turn on the issue of Heathrow expansion. 'Filed vertically' In his acceptance speech on being elected MP for Uxbridge, Mr Johnson said he would lie down "in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway" at Heathrow. Asked on his regular radio phone-in show if he would resign, Mr Johnson pointed out he did not have a government job to resign from - on Monday he was named as someone who would attend the Conservatives' political cabinet in Downing Street while concentrating on his final year as London mayor and being an MP. He was then asked by Nick Ferrari if he would force a by-election. Mr Johnson said he thought he "would be best off staying in Parliament to fight the case". He added that he thought Heathrow was "undeliverable" and that if the Davies Commission did choose a new runway there as its preferred option, he hoped it would be "filed vertically [shelved]" as a series of other reviews in past decades had been.	London Mayor Boris Johnson has said he would not quit as an MP if a Conservative government approved a third runway at Heathrow.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old earned GB's second medal of the Hong Kong championships following Elinor Barker's silver medal in the women's scratch on Wednesday. Latham emerged from the pack to take bronze as he chased down Adrian Teklinski of Poland, who won gold, and Lucass Liss of Germany, who got silver. In the men's team pursuit, GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am really happy to come away with a medal, finally," Latham told the BBC. "I wasn't sure that Teklinski was going to hold on there. "I was in a decent position most of the time. I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out." Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go. And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride. Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman "Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there. "We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him. "But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there. "More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that." Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy "I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in. "But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race. "He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team." Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson. The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress. She told the BBC: "It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting. "The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in. "Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds." Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: "Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal. "Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them." Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round. The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong. The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday. Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin. "I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected," she said. "I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great. "I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo."

Giving evidence for the ex-Sunderland winger at Bradford Crown Court, Stacey Flounders said she did not see a future in their relationship. The 26-year-old is the mother of Mr Johnson's one-year-old daughter. Mr Johnson, 28, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child. In the witness box, Miss Flounders described how he had told her "everything" about kissing a 15-year-old girl when he returned from a police station after his arrest in March last year. Asked if he talked about other things, she said: "The other women that he cheated on me with." Miss Flounders was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending, how many there were and she said: "Quite a few." When questioned about about the future of her relationship with Mr Johnson, she replied: "We're just going to remain friends." She told the jury she had stayed with him after his arrest "because he was honest with me and I knew he was telling the truth". "We'd just had a daughter. I wanted us to be a family. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what was going on." Mr Pownall finished his questions by asking Miss Flounders if she saw any future in "the relationship that you had". She replied: "Do you mean now? Not at the minute, I don't. No." She was asked about messages she exchanged with Mr Johnson on the day of the incident with the girl, and she admitted she suspected him of being unfaithful but had no "hard and fast evidence". She said he first told her he was going to plead guilty around September last year. Miss Flounders said she had previously exchanged messages with the teenager involved after she recognised her as one of the fans who waited for Mr Johnson after home matches. She said she even wished the girl happy birthday in 2014. She added that after his arrest, Mr Johnson told her the girl was aged 16. Kate Blackwell, QC, prosecuting, went through some of the details of the teenager's account of the incident and asked Miss Flounders whether her partner had told her about each. Miss Blackwell asked her if he told her the pair had kissed with tongues and about various messages Mr Johnson had exchanged with the girl. Miss Flounders agreed that he had not told her, although she said he had mentioned he asked for a "thank you kiss". Earlier, Miss Flounders was asked a series of questions about her partner's pubic hair and was asked to examine a photograph. The teenager involved in the incident has told the jury Mr Johnson was shaved in that area. Miss Flounders said he would trim the area with scissors, but would not shave. Mr Johnson began his football career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012. He has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.  These relate to him kissing the girl in his Range Rover after exchanging messages with her on social media. But he denies two further charges of sexual activity with a child relating to the same incident.	The ex-girlfriend of former England footballer Adam Johnson has told a jury they split up after he admitted cheating on her with "quite a few" women.

In its annual report, the charity said its local workers carried out a total of 349 counselling sessions with children at risk of suicide in 2015/16. The callers considered most at risk were aged between 12 and 15. Across the UK as whole, the number of calls from suicidal children almost doubled from the total five years ago. The figure show that youngsters plagued by suicidal thoughts contacted Childline 19,481 times throughout the UK last year - an average of one call every 30 minutes. The charity also said girls were more likely to seek its help than boys. Geraldine McConaghy, a senior supervisor with Childline Northern Ireland, said suicidal thoughts were a result of the "pressures that young people are under". "They might have poor mental health, they might be feeling pressure from school, pressure within the family," she said. "When they come to us, what we've noticed is that, on average, one child in Northern Ireland contacts Childline each day who is feeling suicidal." One 17-year-old girl who contacted the charity last year said she was having difficulties coping at college and finding the lessons "a struggle". "In the past, I've had to take some time off because I've been suffering with mental health problems," the caller told Childline staff. "Sometimes I feel so stressed and useless; I just have to walk out. "I sometimes feel like I want to die." Childline Northern Ireland's service manager, Mairead Monds, said: "We need to understand that there are children and young people living in Northern Ireland that are experiencing significant mental health problems, self-esteem issues, isolation and feelings of worthlessness. "These are children who have very little support and who very often feel that life is simply not worth living."	Childline received a call from children experiencing suicidal thoughts in Northern Ireland almost every day over the course of last year.
In an even first leg of few chances, Walsh's quality hit from range with 16 minutes remaining gave the English league champions the edge. City should have gone ahead through Scotland's Jane Ross, but she hesitated after rounding the Brondby goalkeeper. The Danish side host the second leg on Wednesday, 16 November. Facing an organised Brondby outfit who have reached the semi-finals on three occasions, City struggled to create chances in the first half but right-back Lucy Bronze did force a good low save from visiting keeper Katrine Abel. The hosts could have gone behind, but England stopper Karen Bardsley was alert to produce a low, one-handed save to deny Nanna Christiansen. After half-time the energetic Ross raced clear and calmly rounded Abel, but, with the goal gaping, defender Simone Sorensen had time to recover and intercept the danger. As City began to dominate, England Under-19 international Walsh produced the game's finest moment, finding the far corner with a crisp effort from outside the area which capped another excellent individual performance in the holding role. City, who won a domestic double in 2016 by adding the Continental Cup to their maiden league title, have now kept 20 clean sheets in 26 matches in all competitions this year. Brondby pushed for an away goal late on but Bardsley tipped away Veje Katrine's curling effort in the closing stages - a save which could prove crucial. City manager Nick Cushing was full of praise for young star Walsh after the game, hailing her as one of the best midfielders in the FA Women's Super League. "I'm glad she scored because I think her performances have been up there with the best, if not the best, players in the league," he told BBC Sport. "She's been one of our key performers consistently. "Her main attribute is her game intelligence. She's bright, she understands the game and technically her passing range is really good. "We haven't even seen the best of her yet, she's got real potential." Manchester City: Bardsley, Bronze, Stokes, Beattie, Houghton (capt).

Former Pompey shot stopper Carson brilliantly prevented Michael Smith's powerful header and Michael Doyle's 20-yard pile driver, He then blocked a Conor Chaplin header in stoppage time as the hosts missed out on the opportunity to put more pressure on the top three. Pompey, unchanged for a fourth successive game, looked the more likely to score throughout, Gary Roberts the first to put pressure on the Pools goal as he won the ball on the touchline before dragging wide on the edge of the box. Winger Kyle Bennett was next in the queue to see a sight of Carson's goal, his give-and-go with Smith was excellent but he hooked his finish past the post, and then Gareth Evans and Roberts both had further first-half efforts. Hartlepool had shipped 11 in their last three matches in all competitions and not scored in seven fixtures against Pompey, and hardly threatened on this occasion. Carl Baker twisted and turned himself into a shooting position for the hosts after the break but his chance was deflected over, before substitute Chaplin air kicked at Kal Naismith's cross.

Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA from ancient remains in the Caucasus has now revealed a fourth population that fed into the mix. Details are published in Nature Communications. Scientific advances in recent years have allowed researchers to retrieve and analyse genomes from ancient burials. The genome is the genetic blueprint for a human, contained within the nucleus of every cell. This deluge of data has transformed our understanding of the modern human genetic landscape. It has also shown that present-day genetic patterns are poor guides to ancient ones. The first layer of European ancestry, the indigenous hunter-gatherers, entered Europe before the Ice Age 40,000 years ago. But 7,000 years ago, they were swept up in a migration of people from the Middle East, who introduced farming to Europe. About 5,000 years ago, herders called the Yamnaya entered Europe from the eastern Steppe region - in present day Ukraine and Russia. These horse riding metal workers may have brought Indo-European languages with them; today this language family comprises most of the tongues spoken in Europe. The discovery of plague DNA in Yamnaya burials and a population decline in Europe around the same time has led some researchers to wonder if their passage west was facilitated by the spread of disease. The Yamnaya transformed the gene pools of northern and central Europe, such that some populations, like Norwegians, owe around 50% of their ancestry to these Steppe pastoralists. But the Yamnaya were themselves a mixed population. Around half of their ancestry came from a sister group to the hunter-gatherers who inhabited Europe before farming, while the other half appears to be from a population related to - but noticeably different from - the Middle Eastern migrants who introduced farming. Researchers have now analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia that are 13,300 and 9,700 years old. The results show that these Caucasus hunters were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamnaya. The Caucasus hunter-gatherer genomes show a continued mixture with their Middle Eastern cousins to the south, who would go on to invent farming 10,000 years ago. However, this mixing ended about 25,000 years ago - just before the time of the last glacial maximum, or peak of the Ice Age. At this point, populations shrank - as shown by their genes homogenising, a sign of breeding between those with increasingly similar DNA. Once the ice retreated, the Caucasus groups came into contact with a different group of hunter-gatherers living on the Steppe and mixed with them, laying the genetic foundations of the Yamnaya people. "The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now," said co-author Dr Andrea Manica, from the University of Cambridge. "We can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation." The researchers also suggest that the Caucasus hunter-gatherers influenced populations further east, particularly in South Asia. They suggest that this strand of ancestry may also have been associated with the spread of Indo-European languages to the region.	Geneticists have detected a fourth ancestral "tribe" which contributed to the modern European gene pool.
Nuclear war, global warming and genetically-engineered viruses are among the scenarios he singles out. And he says that further progress in science and technology will create "new ways things can go wrong". Prof Hawking is giving this year's BBC Reith Lectures, which explore research into black holes, and his warning came in answer to audience questions. He says that assuming humanity eventually establishes colonies on other worlds, it will be able to survive. "Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years. "By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race. "However, we will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period." Prof Hawking's first Reith Lecture will be broadcast on 26 January and on 2 February at 9am on BBC Radio 4. BBC World Service listeners can tune in on 26 January at 15:06 GMT and 2 February at 15:06 GMT or catch up online via www.bbc.com/worldserviceradio BBC News online will be publishing the text of Prof Hawking's lectures with accompanying notes by our science editor, David Shukman. iWonder: A brief history of Stephen Hawking It is ironic that such a prominent figure in science identifies scientific progress itself as the major source of new threats. On previous occasions, he has highlighted the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming powerful enough to cause the extinction of the human race. But he insists that ways will be found to cope. "We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognise the dangers and control them. I'm an optimist, and I believe we can." Asked for advice for young scientists, Prof Hawking said they should retain a sense of wonder about "our vast and complex" Universe. "From my own perspective, it has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. There is nothing like the Eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before." But he also said that future generations of researchers should be aware of how scientific and technological progress is changing the world, and to help the wider public understand it. "It's important to ensure that these changes are heading in the right directions. In a democratic society, this means that everyone needs to have a basic understanding of science to make informed decisions about the future. "So communicate plainly what you are trying to do in science, and who knows, you might even end up understanding it yourself." Since his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, Prof Hawking's determination to overcome the immense physical challenges of his disability has been a source of worldwide admiration and fascination. His daughter Lucy, a journalist and writer, who has co-written children's science books with Prof Hawking, was asked to explain his drive. "I think he's enormously stubborn and has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going," she said. "But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival, but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work, writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities, and being a family man, a friend and a colleague to so many people and keeping up with friends across the world."

The Sri Lankan shared a second-wicket stand of 187 with opener Rory Burns (80) as Surrey reached 394-5 at stumps. Sangakkara was dropped at first slip by Craig Overton on nine but went on to hit 24 fours and four sixes to register his 56th first-class century. Jason Roy hit an attacking 85 before he was out lbw to seamer Lewis Gregory in the final over of the day. Sangakkara passed 1,000 first-class runs for Surrey in just his 22nd innings before he was out caught at deep cover by Overton off Tim Groenewald. Zafar Ansari, making his return from a dislocated thumb sustained against Lancashire late last season, struck five fours in an unbeaten 28 before play ended. Media playback is not supported on this device Surrey batsman Kumar Sangakkara told BBC Radio London: "I think after the Nottingham game it was important we got off to a good start in the first game at home. "They way everyone went about their batting, the application and the intent they showed, was very good. "Burnsy and Jason were outstanding. It was very easy to bat with them because they kept putting pressure on the bowlers and putting the bad balls away. "It made my batting a lot easier for me because I saw a positive intent all the time from the other end."	Kumar Sangakkara hit a superb 171 as Surrey's batsman dominated the opening day against Somerset at The Oval.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Gunners had two penalty claims denied and had chances to win the game through Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck. Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic made a string of saves, most notably touching Joel Campbell's free-kick on to a post. The Tigers created little, but defended admirably to frustrate Arsene Wenger in his 100th FA Cup game as Arsenal boss. The two sides made a total of 19 changes between them from their previous games - nine for Arsenal and 10 for Hull. But Steve Bruce's Tigers not only ended a 14-game winning run in the FA Cup for the Gunners, they also prevented a repeat of their defeats by the Londoners in the 2014 final and last season's third round. Relive Arsenal's draw with Hull Media playback is not supported on this device Arsenal's priorities undoubtedly lie elsewhere, with Wenger's side only two points off the top of the Premier League and a visit of Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie coming up on Tuesday. Europe is particularly pressing for the Gunners, who have failed to go past the last 16 in any of the past five seasons, which meant there was no place for key man Mesut Ozil in the squad, while Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez were restricted to contributions from the bench. Despite the team bearing little resemblance to the XI that started in the 2-1 win over Leicester City last week, the Gunners were good enough to control the game from start to finish and created enough chances to have secured a comfortable victory. However, the draw means Arsenal are still in with a chance of becoming the first team to win three consecutive FA Cups since Blackburn Rovers accomplished the feat 130 years ago. It is not only Arsenal who have distractions away from the FA Cup this term, as Hull continue their bid to return to the Premier League after last season's relegation. Only Curtis Davies remained in the side from last week's draw with Brighton, and the former Aston Villa defender blocked, headed and tracked runners enthusiastically alongside Alex Bruce and Harry Maguire in a defensive three. Hull boss Bruce could be forgiven for the pragmatism in his team selection, as his men are in the midst of a run of 10 games in 35 days, which will now become even more congested thanks to the replay. And while his team's resilience with have pleased the former Birmingham City manager, he will also have been delighted by the performance of 16-year-old Josh Tymon, who looked confident and composed at left full-back. Arsenal's only issue came in front of goal, as they moved the ball around with precision to carve out 24 shots - 11 on target - compared to the six shots mustered by Hull. But they could not find a way past Jakupovic, who allowed himself a self-congratulatory moment after taking time out to watch a replay of one of his saves on the big screen at the Emirates. January signing Elneny, making only his second start for the Gunners, put in a standout performance for the home side. The Egypt international was always available for the ball in midfield and dictated the pace for Arsenal from the middle of the park. And there were promising signs from 19-year-old Nigerian Iwobi, who found plenty of space behind striker Theo Walcott to attempt through balls into a congested Hull penalty area, only for the hosts to draw a blank every time. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "The replay is not especially good news but Hull defended very well. "We were not incisive or accurate enough in our passing in the final third. As long as they did not concede, they maintained with how they played. We had 20 shots, 70% possession, but no goals. "I cannot influence the referee's decisions, only the technical quality of my team. If we have no injuries, we can cope with the fixtures. "I think FA Cup replays is a particularity of the English rules and you have to respect that." Media playback is not supported on this device Hull manager Steve Bruce: "I don't know when we're going to play the replay. That's added to the fixture pile-up we've got. "We made 10 changes and we rode our luck a bit, but the team deserved it for the spirit and the 100% effort they gave. "It bodes well when I see the strength in depth we've got, because we're going to need it. "Josh Tymon didn't look out of his depth and it's great to see someone from the academy, from Hull, come in and wear the shirt." Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic: "My little daughter, my father, everybody is here. We knew it would be a difficult game and would be defend all game. We got a 0-0 and I hope the replay will be the same." Arsenal have the small matter of the visit of five-time European champions Barcelona on Tuesday, for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Hull go to Ipswich on Tuesday and then host Sheffield Wednesday on Friday in the Championship. Have you added News Alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Following the announcement of the new global calendar in March, Premiership Rugby confirmed the 2019-20 domestic season will start in early September and finish at the end of June. Leicester's Tom Youngs had said the proposal "fills players with dread". The RPA has now said a shortened two-month off-season will be "seriously detrimental to player welfare". Premiership Rugby has previously said the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become "more sophisticated" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But an RPA statement on Monday read: "The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL. "Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads they face. "The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated." England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs. "Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players," the statement continued. "If the Premiership season retains its current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11-month season for these players. "This cannot be avoided unless these players start their domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension."	The Rugby Players' Association has "unanimously rejected" proposals for an extended 10-month Premiership season.
We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia. What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin. We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages. What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people. We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast. Let's call him Kamrul Rahman. He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up. As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked. He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them. It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost. He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about Â£1,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand. I was amazed. "So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?" I asked. "Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger", he told me, without any sign of emotion. "If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour." We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh. They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made. What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party. The so-called "ransoms" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey. Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp. Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into. If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers. The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like. Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid. The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier. It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand. But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty. We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (Â£260/$400) back to his family each month. But many, many migrants don't make it. Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters). Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family. According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia. Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me. "Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food. "All people have to die", he said, "that is fate."	Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia.
Choupo-Moting, 28, is their fourth signing of the summer after Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma and Josh Tymon. "Eric has been on our radar for several years and we actually tried to bring him to the club four years ago," chief executive Tony Scholes said. Stoke open their Premier League season with a trip to Everton on Saturday. Choupo-Moting, who has also played for Hamburg and Mainz, has made 200 Bundesliga appearances and played in the Champions League with Schalke. A former Germany youth international, he switched international allegiance to Cameroon in 2010. He represented the Indomitable Lions at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and has won 48 caps, scoring 13 goals. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Stoke City have signed Cameroon winger Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a three-year deal after his contract ran out at German club Schalke.
He says that he's found the engines from the Apollo 11 space rocket - the craft that carried the first men to the moon in 1969. The five engines broke off from the spaceship after blast off and crashed somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. He's now planning on trying to bring one of them to the surface. Mr Bezos paid for a team to use advanced sonar scanning equipment to track down the lost F-1 engines. They were found 4,300 metres below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, but he hasn't said exactly where they were spotted. In a blog post about the discovery he wrote: "I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television, and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering, and exploration." He said he was going to ask Nasa, which owns the rockets, for permission to display one of the engines in the Museum of Flight in his home city of Seattle.	Internet giant Amazon's owner Jeff Bezos has made an amazing underwater discovery.
Mark Jones, 43, who had been in hospital since the incident on 26 July, died on Saturday. Two men have been charged with attempted murder and having a shotgun following the shooting on New Road, Mountain Ash. South Wales Police said a review of those charges would now take place. Edward Bennett, 47, from Mountain Ash, and Stephen Bennett, 52, from Pontypridd, were both remanded in custody after appearing at Cardiff Crown Court in August. Det Ch Insp Ceri Hughes said: "Our thoughts are with Mark's family who are being supported by a family liaison officer at this difficult time. "A review of charges in relation to the two men in custody will now take place."	A man who was in a critical condition after a shooting in Rhondda Cynon Taff two months ago has now died, police said.
Jean-Yves Le Drian, who is visiting Mali, said a force of 1,000 would be left in place. France intervened militarily in January to oust Islamist militants who had taken over the north of the country. A UN force in Mali, Minusma, was due to number 12,000 by now - but is still less than half of that. At the height of the crisis, France had a force of about 4,500 in its former colony. In July, France handed over responsibility for security to Minusma - which has incorporated West African troops who backed the French offensive. But France's timetable to withdraw most of its forces by the end of the year has slipped. The 1,000 French soldiers left in Mali are intended to help fight the al-Qaeda-linked groups still targeting the vast desert northern region. "We will remain by the side of the Malian army, and also Minusma, for as long as it takes," AFP news agency quotes Mr Le Drian as saying. On Monday, UN peacekeepers found a large cache of explosives while on patrol near the northern town of Kidal. UN spokesman Olivier Salgado said the quantity of ammonium nitrate found could be used to make between 20 to 25 car bombs, the Associated Press news agency reports.	France is to reduce the number of its troops in Mali over the next three months by 60%, the French defence minister has said.
The 53-year-old man, identified as Ramu Chavan, was accosted by traffic police after they received multiple calls from people who saw him. Police told BBC Hindi that Mr Chavan had confessed to beheading his wife but did not divulge a motive. Police suspect he is mentally unstable and are seeking more information. He worked as a watchman at a building currently under construction, police said. Videos and images of Mr Chavan walking around the city with the severed head are being circulated on Indian social media. Police told BBC Hindi that he appeared to be walking towards the police station even before he was accosted by officers. Meanwhile the relatives of the murdered woman, identified as Sonubai, have arrived in the city, and police are trying to get more information about Chavan from them.	A man in the western Indian city of Pune has been held after carrying his wife's severed head down a busy road, police say.
Moments after Chris Evans announced he was stepping down as a presenter on Top Gear, Twitter users took to social media to comment about the number of recent high-profile resignations in politics and sport. The writer Will Black started the hashtag #SuggestAJobForFarage after Nigel Farage stepped down as UKIP leader on Monday morning. So it was probably inevitable that the Top Gear presenter's vacancy was among the job opportunities suggested on social media for Mr Farage. Others thought another political figure should be considered for the post, although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is not considering any new career opportunities. As social media bets were placed on who should take up Evans's now vacant post, some Twitter users suggested Boris Johnson as a possible replacement. While others thought there was only one man for the job. @RobertRobmurphy tweeted: "Bring back Jeremy Clarkson." Another Twitter user suggested Matt Le Blanc's co-star in Friends should join him on the show. @_EveStarks posted: "Really hope they replace Chris Evans with Matthew Perry so the Friends bromance can continue." Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow threw his hat into the ring. And there were some rank outsiders for the position.

The neighbours entered the burning property in Milford Drive, on Sunday afternoon in an attempt to rescue two cats, police said. The occupants were not home at the time. The women had inhaled smoke and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. The cats were unharmed. Fire destroyed the front door and caused heavy smoke damage to the house. Dorset Police said it believed the fire had been started deliberately through the cat flap in the front door of the property at about 15:00 BST. Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with CCTV to get in touch. Det Con Luke Davis said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity near to the property during that afternoon, particularly anyone seen in the garden or the front drive of the property just before 3pm, to please contact me. "If you have any information about the cause or motive of the fire, please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."	Two women have been rescued following a suspected arson attack on a house in Bournemouth.
They started arriving at Poldhu Cove on the Lizard on Sunday, and National Trust volunteers have been clearing them away as they are said to pose a risk to wildlife. The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked. The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of 'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial." It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May. The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment. Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said. Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was "highly concerned" about the impact on "sensitive marine life". Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: "The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full. "We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas." Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area. It said: "The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away. "In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up. "No attempt should be made to recover the bottles."	Thousands of bright pink plastic detergent bottles have washed up on beaches in Cornwall.
The 28-year-old left Rovers after their National League promotion final defeat by Grimsby earlier this month. He made 33 league appearances this season, scoring six goals from defence, and has previously played for the likes of Cambridge and Mansfield. "I spoke to Gary last week and was delighted to join a great club, moving in the right direction," he said. "There was interest elsewhere but when I had a good couple of hour chat with Gary last week and was happy with his vision."	Left-back James Jennings has joined promoted Cheltenham Town from Gloucestershire rivals Forest Green.
Police said the 41-year-old former Strictly Come Dancing contestant, from Virginia Water in Surrey, was arrested in Eton, Berkshire, on Saturday. Ms Gallacher, who works for Sky Sports, has been bailed to appear at Slough Magistrates' Court on 4 September. Thames Valley Police said she was charged with one count of "driving a motor vehicle when alcohol level was above the legal limit".	Television presenter Kirsty Gallacher has been charged with drink-driving.
Wolves started brightly and Nouha Dicko gave them the lead, beating Rob Green with a low first-time shot on the run. Leeds turned up the pressure after the break, but Andy Lonergan saved from Souleymane Doukara and Kortney Hause cleared off the line to keep it 1-0. Fulham's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday's 2-1 victory at QPR sees Leeds drop into seventh place. Despite losing their past two Championship matches, Wolves dominated the opening exchanges, with Green having to come out quickly and make a low save one-on-one from Andreas Weimann. Dave Edwards forced another Green stop and Dicko went close, cutting inside and firing narrowly wide before the goal their pressure deserved finally came. The 24-year-old striker latched onto Ben Marshall's clever through-ball behind the defence and found the bottom corner before Green could set himself. Leeds rallied, but Pontus Jansson could not hit the target with a free header and Lonergan produced a reflex save to keep out Doukara's header from Kemar Roofe's cutback. Wolves sat back and invited pressure, with Hause clearing Roofe's looping header off the line from a corner and Chris Wood heading over late on, but the away side hung on to claim the points. The win secures Wolves' Championship status for another season on 54 points, while Leeds' third loss in five games puts them out of the play-offs on goal difference with three matches remaining. Leeds manager Garry Monk: "We're disappointed with that result. "We didn't want that to happen at this stage of the season but we've had the mentality for so long where we've been in the play-offs quite comfortably and have kind of been in that protective mode of trying to stay in there. "Now we have to change that mentality to be a team that goes on the hunt and lets it all go. "It's still a really good situation for us. We've got no time to feel sorry for ourselves, that doesn't get you anywhere." Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "We were excellent and should have been two or three up in the first half. "We were strong defensively in the second half and a threat on the break." Match ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1. Second Half ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.

They show that there has been an overall increase of 53% in the number of women being treated for the disease in the last 20 years. The rise was described as dramatic by Royal Victoria Hospital statisticians. Dr Anna Gavin, who led the research, said the health system needs to prepare itself as the figures are set to climb. "I think the services need to gear themselves up because we have done some work looking at past trends," Dr Gavin said. "We see that, in total, the cancer number is expected to increase by two thirds again, about 65% in 20 years. "The service needs to be aware of that. We need to be thinking of ways to cope because it is largely driven by the aging population." Meanwhile, one woman who is living with the disease is calling for greater awareness of inflammatory breast cancer. Lynette McHendry, from County Antrim, is due to have both breasts removed next week. The 37-year-old patient said she believed some inflammatory breast cancer cases are being misdiagnosed. The mother of two is appealing to clinicians to become more aware of the symptoms surrounding this aggressive disease, after her cancer went undetected for over a month. "The symptoms I had were a pain in my left breast - it was hard, tender and heavy," Mrs McHendry said. "It started to swell up and ended up twice the size. It also became red, inflamed and the skin became dimply. And there was no lump." She is in the unusual position of having invasive or regular cancer in one breast and inflammatory cancer in the other. The latter went undetected because, in cases of inflammatory breast cancer, a lump does not appear in the mammogram. Mrs McHendry is one of the almost 2,800 women who were referred last year to the Belfast Cancer centre. Ninety-three percent of those cases were not malignant - but hers was. Mrs McHendry said that although women are better educated about breast cancer, there is little or no public information about inflammatory breast cancer. "I had to join a support group online based in England," she said. "By talking to those women, including one woman from Larne, I discovered so many weren't diagnosed until much later in their cancer journey, which can make a difference between being diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4."	New figures from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry show there has been a dramatic rise in the numbers of women being diagnosed with breast cancer.
Two special concerts at the Royal Albert Hall will see pupils perform their own response to 10 pieces of classic music. The Ten Pieces project was announced last year as part of an initiative to inspire primary school children to learn more about classical music. Each Prom will feature pupils playing music, as well as dance, film and animation. The schoolchildren's work will run alongside the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, which will play the original 10 pieces of music, which include Mozart, Handel and Holst. Blue Peter's Barney Harwood and children's TV presenters Dick and Dom will host the concerts on 18 and 19 July, the opening weekend of this year's Proms. The Saturday concert will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, while the Sunday concert will be recorded for future broadcast on BBC Radio 2. Last June, the BBC announced ten pieces of classical music aimed at inspiring schoolchildren to create their own works. Since October 2014, some 8,500 primary school pupils have signed up to take part in the scheme, which offers musical workshops from local arts organisations as well as an online film about classical music, which has been seen by more than 120,000 children so far. The schoolchildren are being invited to submit their "creative responses" to the music to the Ten Pieces website, as either films, audio recordings or images, by the end of March. The full 2015 BBC Proms season will be announced in April. John Adams: Short Ride in a Fast Machine Beethoven: Symphony No. 5 (1st movement) Britten: 'Storm' Interlude from Peter Grimes Grieg: In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt Handel: Zadok the Priest Holst: Mars from The Planets Anna Meredith: Connect It Mozart: Horn Concerto No. 4 (3rd movement) Mussorgsky: A Night on the Bare Mountain Stravinsky: The Firebird - suite (1911) (Finale)	Schoolchildren will perform their own work at this year's Proms.
Cook made an unbeaten half-century against the tourists for South Africa A in a warm-up match before the series. The 33-year-old is the son of former Proteas Test batsman Jimmy Cook. England have already won the four-match series and lead it 2-0 after beating South Africa by seven wickets in Johannesburg on Saturday. "Stephen has been in excellent form this season and gives us another option at the top of the order," said chief selector Linda Zondi. He looks set to replace the out-of-form Stiaan van Zyl, who has made just 69 runs in five innings at the top of the order. Cook has scored two centuries and a 76 in his past three matches for the Highveld Lions. Dale Steyn retains his place in a 17-man squad for the match, but is thought to be struggling with the shoulder injury that has kept him out of the past two Tests. Quinton de Kock is also set to return as wicketkeeper. He was ruled out of the third Test after injuring his knee while walking his dogs, but his replacement Dane Vilas has not been included this time. South Africa squad: AB de Villiers (c), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Quinton de Kock (wkt), JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl, Hardus Viljoen.	Uncapped opener Stephen Cook has been added to the South Africa squad for the final Test against England, which starts in Pretoria on Friday.
A trailer was taken from Burton's Foods Ltd on Ty Coch Way, Cwmbran, Torfaen on 17 June. The two men, from Liverpool and Cheshire, had been charged with theft. A hearing at Newport Magistrates' Court heard a third man will appear in court in relation to the alleged theft on Friday.	The case against two men accused of stealing £20,000 of biscuits from the makers of Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels has been dropped.
Until mid-July, her main worry was getting the right grades for medical school. Now Chilla and her fellow pupils are faced with Turkish accusations that their school has links to a terrorist organisation. Kharisma Bangsa school is one of hundreds across the world that Turkey wants to shut down because they have links to a US-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The cleric is held responsible by the Ankara government for the failed July coup in which more than 270 people died. And Turkey argues the schools are part of a strategy to undermine the state. But pupils, teachers and parents interviewed in several countries say they have no links to suspicious activities. Turkey looks to close Gulen schools Who are the Gulenists? Who is Fethullah Gulen? Turkey coup: Who was behind Turkey coup attempt? Kharisma Bangsa is one of nine Indonesian schools Ankara says should be shut down because of their alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen. Turkey says the schools are part of a vast and secretive network which the Gulen movement has used to build a powerbase and infiltrate state institutions. Accusations have been levelled against schools with Turkish connections in more than a dozen countries, from Germany to Afghanistan, leaving thousands of children facing uncertainty over their education. Supporters of the schools say they are no more than a loose affiliation of institutions that share common values and are committed to academic excellence. From extensive interviews with BBC World Service across 10 countries in three continents, it is clear that the schools have much in common but operate quite differently. But all are feeling the pressure. There is no common brand name for the schools. In Pakistan they are called "Pak-Turk Lycees", in Kyrgyzstan they are known as "Sebat" (Persistence) schools, and in Kenya, "Light Academies". Most were set up as partnerships between Turkish and local businesses and organisations, but in many countries like Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan, the Turkish partners are no longer directly involved. Local and Turkish partners say they're admirers of Fethullah Gulen, but not connected to him formally. "A Gulen school, business or newspaper is generally unofficially labelled as such, because the owner or manager considers Fethullah Gulen as a spiritual leader or source of inspiration," says Turkish academic Bayram Balci. Alp Aslandogan, who speaks on behalf of Gulen-associated schools in the United States, says there are numerous social networks within the movement. "The schools which are seen as affiliated with the movement were started by people who belong to these networks." Followers of Fethullah Gulen often refer to their movement by the name Hizmet (service), and the schools all share the same ethics. "The teachers put emphasis on character-building, morals, and discipline," says Rosi, the mother of a pupil at Kharisma Bangsa. There's also a strong focus on teaching science. From Nairobi to Kandahar, school websites show pupils in smart uniforms, studying in well-equipped science labs or computer rooms. "The children study every day until 3pm, then they have additional classes, activity clubs, and homework," says Baktigul, whose daughter attends a Turkish school in Kyrgyzstan. "At 9pm they all sit down to have tea, and at 10pm it's bedtime." For Maxim Urazaev, who graduated from a Turkish lycee in the Russian city of Kazan in 2009 the experience was "tougher than being in the army". Head teachers have told the BBC the schools are not part of a formal structure. The head of Kyrgyzstan's 21 Sebat schools, Nurlan Kudaberdiev, says they are all connected to Fethullah Gulen informally because the schools were his idea. "But there's no direct influence or financing from his side any more," he insists. Long before the Turkish government tried to shut the schools down, other countries took action of their own amid suspicion of the network's foreign links. In 2000, Uzbekistan shut down all Gulen-associated schools operating there, and similar steps were taken in Russia, where only seven remain of the 50 schools that used to operate until 2008. All are now firmly under Education Ministry supervision in the Turkic-speaking Muslim region of Tatarstan. The schools describe themselves as secular, promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue. "In my five years at the school I never once saw a Koran or a Bible," says Maxim Urazaev, from Kazan. But in Russia and elsewhere schools have been accused of running extra-curricular and secret, religious study groups. Many former Soviet countries are deeply suspicious of religious activity beyond state control. A former teacher in Tatarstan rejected the idea of "secret gatherings" but told the BBC that pupils who wanted to could pray with their teachers and talk to them about religion. In Kenya, former students and teachers showed us books by Fethullah Gulen that they had been given. In Kyrgyzstan, 15-year-old Zainal said pupils were sometimes shown videos about Islam. But her mother, Bakhtigul, said she was satisfied it was not a problem. "I even checked the books in their library to see if they had any Gulen literature or suspicious books, but there was nothing." Gulen-affiliated schools have existed in Turkey since the 1970s and only expanded into a truly global phenomenon in the past 20 years. That expansion came as Fethullah Gulen grew closer to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamist-rooted AK Party swept to victory in 2002. By teaching Turkish and promoting Turkish culture the schools helped to reinforce Turkey's position and influence across the former Soviet Union, the Far East and into Africa. In 2015 Turkey invested $6.2bn (Â£4.7bn; â‚¬5.5bn) across Africa. Somalia became a flagship for Turkish aid and investment, with three Gulen-linked schools catering for more than 1,000 children. Although the schools are fee-paying and attract the children of the elite, they also offer scholarships to poorer families. In Pakistan up to a quarter of children are on scholarships, in Afghanistan it is nearly 30%. Quite apart from the lure of a good education, the schools also offer an opportunity to travel by way of inter-school competitions known as "Olympiads". Star pupils from Kabul have competed in maths and Turkish-language competitions in Uganda, while children from Mogadishu have tested their skills in Kazakhstan. The schools say the competitions are a way of making a global network of friends. But Turkey argues they enable a movement responsible for a deadly coup attempt to continue recruiting new members worldwide. Thousands of children and their families have been left feeling vulnerable, and for many their future at the Gulen schools is unclear. "I've been here for eleven years," says Musukan, a sixth former at the Pak-Turk school in Islamabad. "This was the best time of my life. We love it here." "If Turkey really has problems, don't involve us," says Salwa, an Indonesian sixth former. "We're only here to study and to pursue our dreams."

Media playback is not supported on this device Rachel Morris led GB's rowing success with arms-shoulders single sculls gold. Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley won the trunk-and-arms mixed double sculls and the mixed coxed four added a third gold for ParalympicsGB. In track cycling, Lora Turnham won the B 3km individual pursuit and the men's C1-5 team claimed sprint gold in a world record time. Compatriot Neil Fachie won cycling B 1km time trial silver, with Sophie Thornhill, gold medallist in the 1km time trial on Friday, and her pilot Helen Scott taking bronze in the B 3km pursuit. There were British triathlon silvers for Lauren Steadman in the PT4 and Alison Patrick in the PT5, with Melissa Reid taking bronze in the same event. GB's Tom Aggar won bronze in the men's arms-shoulders single sculls. The four rowing medals were won within an hour on the Lagoa water in Rio and Great Britain have now claimed 20 gold medals and 46 overall to sit second in the medal table behind China. Morris, who had both legs amputated because of complex regional pain syndrome, finished ahead of China's Lili Wang, while Israel's Moran Samuel took bronze. The Welsh competitor switched to rowing in 2013 and now has three Paralympic medals across two sports, adding to the hand-cycling time trial gold she won in Beijing in 2008 and bronze at London 2012. "That was the hardest thing I've ever done," she said. "It just goes to show if you have stuff drilled into you every day by the coaches and you do it you can win." The pairing of Whiteley and Rowles was only created last year, when 18-year-old Rowles switched from wheelchair racing to rowing. The duo won silver at last year's World Championships and in Rio beat the silver medal-winning pair from China and the third-placed French team to add a Paralympic title to their collection. James Fox, Pam Relph, Dan Brown and Grace Clough, along with cox Oliver James, defended Great Britain's gold from London 2012 in the mixed coxed four, finishing ahead of the USA and Canada. GB have dominated this event in recent years, taking gold at the past three World Championships - although only Relph, 26, remains from the boat that prevailed in London four years ago. "It feels amazing. Coming through that last 250 metres I knew that we had won it," said Relph. "We knew we were fitter, stronger and faster than our rivals but we still had to deliver." Media playback is not supported on this device Turnham, 26, who has a hereditary sight-loss condition, teamed up with her pilot Corrine Hall to beat New Zealand's Emma Foy to improve on her fourth place at London 2012 and bronze at the World Championships. Jody Cundy, who won gold in the 1,000m time trial on Friday, Jon-Allan Butterworth and Louis Rolfe, bronze medallist in the C2 3,000m pursuit, beat their own world record, set in qualifying, to take team sprint gold. The trio clocked a winning time of 48.635 seconds to beat China by 1.279secs. It was Cundy's seventh Paralympic title across both swimming and Para-cycling and his second in Rio following his disastrous disqualification in the time trial at London 2012. "After four years ago and being the lowest I've ever been this is probably the highest I've ever been," said the 37-year-old. "I was properly nervous for the kilo, I didn't really enjoy it that much. But this one, with these two guys, and the way they have been riding in the last couple of months, it's a pleasure to get up there and perform." London 2012 gold medallist Fachie, who has a congenital eye condition, and his pilot Pete Mitchell finished 0.419 seconds behind gold medallist Tristan Bangma of the Netherlands in the B 1km time trial. Britain had high hopes of bolstering their gold tally in the Para-triathlon, with the event included at a Games for the first time. But Andy Lewis' PT2 gold on Saturday will be GB's only gold, although the women added two silvers and a bronze. Steadman, who was born without a lower right arm, had been favourite to add a Paralympic title to her 2013 and 2014 world crowns. But the 23-year-old former swimmer from Peterborough lost out to the USA's Grace Norman by one minute and four seconds. In the PT5 classification for visually impaired athletes, world champion Patrick, with her guide Hazel Smith, and world bronze medallist Reid, with her guide Nicole Walters, finished second and third respectively behind Katie Kelly of Australia. Britain's Bethany Firth and Jessica-Jane Applegate will take their 200m freestyle S14 rivalry into Sunday's final (22:37 BST). Defending champion Applegate set a new Paralympic record of two minutes 7.95 seconds in her heat, only for Firth, already 100m backstroke gold medallist, to beat that time by 1.99secs. Tom Hamer set a Paralympic record of 1:57.31 in the 200m freestyle S14 heats and Rebecca Redfearn followed suit in the 100m breaststroke SB13 with a time of 1:17.08. Their finals are at 22:29 BST and the 22:09 BST respectively on Sunday. GB's men's wheelchair basketball team made it three wins from three in their group to qualify for the quarter-finals. They beat Germany 66-52 on Friday and will face London 2012 bronze medallists USA on Monday to decide who will be the Group B winners. There is the prospect of double gold in table tennis for Britain, after Will Bayley and Rob Davies progressed to their finals. Bayley, who was born with the muscle-shortening illness arthrogryposis and was a silver medallist four years ago, beat Spain's Jordi Morales 3-1 in the class seven to set up a gold-medal match with Israel Stroh of Brazil on Monday. Davies, who uses a wheelchair after breaking his neck playing rugby, overcame Endre Major of Hungary 3-1 in his semi-final and will meet south Korean Young Dae Joo in the class 1 final on Tuesday.	Britain claimed five more gold medals at the Rio Paralympics, including a best-ever tally of three in the rowing.
Roedd y Farwnes Eluned Morgan, AC dros Ganolbarth a Gorllewin Cymru, yn siarad wedi i Nicola Sturgeon gadarnhau y byddai'n ceisio am ail refferendwm ar annibyniaeth i'r Alban. Dywedodd arweinydd Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, bod "angen i Gymru benderfynu ar ei dyfodol" yn dilyn cyhoeddiad Ms Sturgeon. Yn ôl y Farwnes Morgan nid oes "awch o gwbl am annibyniaeth yng Nghymru", gan ychwanegu na fyddai Cymru yn le cyfforddus petai'r Alban yn gadael y DU. Gwrthod hynny wnaeth AC Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, gan ddweud bod "awch ar lawr gwlad i gymryd rheolaeth o ffawd, tynged a dyfodol eu hunain". Yn siarad ar raglen Taro'r Post, dywedodd y Farwnes Morgan bod pobl sy'n "poeni am yr economi, gwasanaethau cyhoeddus" yn "gwybod nad ydi hi'n bosib i Gymru fod yn annibynnol fel gwald ar hyn o bryd. Hyd yn oed ar ôl Brexit". Dywedodd bod Cymru yn derbyn rhwng £500-600m y flwyddyn gan yr Undeb Ewropeaidd, ond bod £14bn yn dod o Loegr. "Os fydde Cymru yn mynd yn annibynnol fydd 'na ddim arian i dalu am bensiynau, neb ar y dôl yn cael arian, neb sy'n sâl a methu gweithio yn cael arian," meddai. "Yn economaidd dyw e ddim yn bosib. Mae angen i'r breuddwydio dwl 'ma stopio." Ychwanegodd na fyddai Cymru yn "le cyfforddus" pe bai'r Alban yn gadael y DU, a bod angen cofio am newidiadau posib yng Ngogledd Iwerddon hefyd. Dywedodd: "Dwi'n wirioneddol gobeithio na fydd Yr Alban yn mynd yn wlad annibynnol am y bydd yn galed ofnadwy i Gymru fel gwlad. "Ond 'chydig iawn allwn ni wneud. Pobl Yr Alban sydd efo'r penderfyniad." Yn ymateb ar y rhaglen, dywedodd AC Plaid Cymru dros Ddwyrain Caerfyrddin a Dinefwr, Adam Price, bod ei blaid yn gweithio ar strategaeth economaidd i sicrhau nad yw Cymru'n ddibynnol. Soniodd hefyd bod pryder y gallai'r DU ddod i ben o fewn y blynyddoedd nesaf, a phetai hynny'n digwydd yna byddai angen i bobl Cymru drafod pwnc mor bwysig. "Mae angen cymryd rheolaeth 'nôl. Dyna sy'n gyrru ardaloedd difreintiedig, y teimlad o gael eu hesgeuluso," meddai. "Mae 'na awch ar lawr gwlad i gymryd rheolaeth o ffawd, tynged a dyfodol eu hunain." Ychwanegodd: "Os ydi Cymru am aros ar ei thraed ei hun rhaid gofyn sut? Cau'r ffyniant presennol, a hyn drwy'r strategaeth economaidd."	Mae angen stopio'r "breuddwydio dwl" am annibyniaeth i Gymru yn ôl AC Llafur, sy'n dweud nad yw'n bosib yn economaidd.

The parishioners at St Paul's, Shipley, posted the video on Facebook in February after a traditional advert failed to attract any applicants. It was viewed more than 30,000 times and attracted media coverage across the UK. The new vicar, Henriette Howarth, will take up the post next week. The song, written by the children with the help of the church's musical director Rachel Hesselwood, listed the qualities the new vicar needed. It begins with the lines: "If you want this choice position have a cheery disposition. Make us laugh, smile lots, play games, tell jokes." Other requirements included "You must be kind, you must be fair. Bible stories you will share. "Boy or girl it doesn't matter - but you must enjoy Harry Potter!" It ends with a promise by the children to keep the church tidy and not to "talk in your sermons, we'll be good you'll see".	A church in West Yorkshire has recruited a new vicar following a video job advertisement sung by a choir of children.
In fact, the Swedish star has already lost five months to making her third album... and it's still not finished. "I've been really geeking out," she giggles down the phone. "Almost to a point where it's mathematical, trying to find the balance between all the elements". When inspiration pounces, she can lose "hours, days and weeks" in the studio, "just bending different sentences and rhymes to find the best fit, to find the missing piece of the puzzle". Pop, in particular, puts "so much focus on what you say," she adds. "You have to be really neat and concise. It's important you get it right. "So it's about puzzling together a song, a good pop song, that makes sense. It really is a brain game." The first result of all this effort is Say My Name, a gigantic pop fizzbomb that's primed to explode all over the charts this month. It's a deceptively simple song built around a quirky ukulele riff, but the chorus sticks like Velcro. "Say my name," sings the star, "wear it out like a sweater that you love, cause I can't get enough when you... say my name". "I really love that chorus," she says. "It was such a good feeling when we nailed that one. Like, 'Yes!'" Her painstaking perfectionism reaches a pinnacle in the vocals. Tove is understated and conversational, making you lean in to the song's coquettish flirtation, where most pop divas would have belted out the melody in one take and gone home for a sandwich. "I don't understand how people do that," she protests. "I feel like the vocals are such a huge part of the production. Like, how do I sing this line? How much strength do I put into it? How can I make this melody as interesting as possible? How can I communicate this feeling even more." "And it's the best feeling when you find that missing piece. It's like, 'Arrroooggahh!' Amazing." And if inspiration dries up? "I play solitaire on my phone," laughs the singer. "I have the song on in the background, and I play solitaire so I'm not concentrating so hard. "It's a good way to make sure you don't overthink it. If you force the brain into shutting off then, suddenly, something will just come out of your mouth that fits." Tove Anna LinnÃ©a Ã–stman Styrke was born and raised in Umea, an unassuming university town near the edge of the Arctic Circle, whose most famous former inhabitant is Stieg Larsson, the author of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Her mother was a ballet teacher; while her father was a musician, whose band Max Fenders scored a number one hit in 1975 with the song Vindens Melodi (Wind Melody), and who set Tove on the path to musical stardom when he gave her her first synthesiser. At the age of 16, she entered the TV talent show Swedish Idol, finishing in third place. It delivered her a solid fanbase, but she's not particularly enamoured of the experience. "Its really hard to talk about music and a thing like Swedish Idol at the same time," she once said, "because they have nothing to do with each other". "A competition like that, on TV, that's entertainment, that's a popularity competition... And afterwards, that's when you start making music." Post-Idol, Tove released a rushed, self-titled album which went platinum in Sweden. But she was unhappy with the way she was being presented, and took a three-year break, moving back home to immerse herself in music and work out who she wanted to be. The result was Kiddo, her second album, written from the perspective of a young woman finding her voice in a world that constantly tries to undermine and break women down. It featured pop's best put-down since You're So Vain ("I bet you hit the ground hard when you fell for yourself") and flicked two fingers at the men who tried to turn her into a flesh-baring pop zombie. "Hot glam seems far away from where I am / I can neither understand it nor demand it," she stated on a track called Number One. Strident, sassy and self-confident, it's no surprise that the album was named after Uma Thurman's character in Kill Bill, Beatrix Kiddo. Time Magazine called it a "feminist pop triumph", while it made several critics' end-of-year lists in 2015. Although Kiddo didn't sell in the quantities expected of a mainstream pop record, it won the singer recognition from tastemakers on Radio 1, Billboard Magazine and Rolling Stone; while a tour with pop band Years & Years gained her some real world fans. "Being the support act can be a tough job but I couldn't have chosen a better audience if I'd hand-picked them myself," she marvels. "I noticed they had fans who come back to see multiple shows and, after a while, they were all as excited to see me as they were to see Years and Years. "Just walking up on that stage and singing to that audience was amazing. That was the best thing." The 24-year-old hopes to capitalise on all this goodwill with her new single - which has just been made track of the week by Radio 1's Greg James. It sees the singer turn her keen lyrical eye towards love for the first time, a move which was prompted not by romance, but politics. "Everybody here [in Sweden] was depressed when Trump won, and you can definitely [see] negative political trends happening in Europe, as well. "With everything being kind of heavy, I'm writing more as a way to escape the world. I want to be able to zone out for a minute and have a good time." Say My Name will undoubtedly be seen as a litmus test for Tove's new material at a time when similarly-tipped female pop acts like MÃ˜, Bebe Rexha and Dua Lipa have struggled to gain a foothold. But the singer is undaunted, saying she has a secret stash of hit singles hidden back in Sweden. "I'm going to sound so full of myself but, whatever, I'm a pop princess," she laughs. "I really feel like every song I've done so far is single material. I don't want to see any of them as 'just an album track.'" In common with Calvin Harris, who has reportedly abandoned albums altogether, she is considering releasing music in a more ad hoc nature, either as a series of standalone singles or themed EPs. "I really appreciate the album format sometimes," she explains. "Like, Beyonce's Lemonade album wouldn't work as a collection of singles. "But a lot of people, at least in my audience, just pick their favourite songs and add them to a playlist. "That means there's a lot of songs I spend time on that people don't discover. I just think it's a shame when all of the songs are really good!" Tove Styrke's single, Say My Name, is out now on RCA Records.

The UK could also be allowed to keep many of its trade terms with the EU so as to avoid disruption, Moody's said. The report shows economic warnings from pro-EU groups have been "baseless scaremongering", Vote Leave said. But the Britain Stronger in Europe group said it was further evidence that leaving would damage the economy. The Moody's report comes after the CBI warned a British exit from the EU - known as a "Brexit" - could cost the UK economy Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs. A vote to leave in the 23 June referendum would create significant uncertainty that would hamper economic growth, according to Moody's. But the ratings agency said this would be partly offset by a decline in the pound - making UK exports more competitive - and by companies having time to adjust during UK-EU negotiations that it expects to last for at least two years. "Our central view is that the negative economic impact of Brexit would be relatively small," the credit agency said. As a result, Moody's would "not expect to see significant increases in unemployment or [interest] rates, or substantial declines in property prices across the UK as a whole". Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said of the report: "The UK will not face trade barriers after we Vote Leave, jobs will be safe and our credit rating will not be affected." However, Lucy Thomas, deputy director of Stronger In Europe, said: "By leaving, we would unavoidably end up with worse trade terms. That would hit British industries such as car makers and financial services, putting jobs, low prices and financial security at risk for British people. "Until the Leave campaigns can specify exactly how they would avoid that, going out on our own is a risk we can't afford to take." No trade deal would be as good as the one the UK currently has, she added. Moody's said: "We expect that, over time, the UK and EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most - but probably not all - of the current trading relationships, thereby limiting the impact on UK exporters and supply chains of UK importers." This is because both the UK and EU would want to avoid large-scale disruption, it said. The ratings agency also pointed to HSBC's recent decision to keep its headquarters in London as evidence the capital would still be an attractive home for financial services firms. "Although there are clear downside risks to the City of London's standing as a global financial centre, in our central scenario we do not see Brexit materially damaging its strong position," it said. Gas, electricity, water and broadband networks would see "little" impact from a Leave vote, despite the UK having to replace existing EU regulations. The agency looked at 200 UK companies for the report, finding that the risks of a "Brexit" would mainly centre around: additional trade barriers; investment decisions; regulatory changes; and curbs on migration.	The UK economy would be hit by leaving the EU, but the impact would be "small" and unlikely to lead to big job losses, according to credit agency Moody's.
Mr Hammond dismissed reports of angry rows between the two as "tittle tattle" although he jokingly acknowledged he occasionally swore. Mrs May said she was "focused on 8 June". Mr Hammond and Mrs May were speaking at a press conference they arranged to attack Labour's election manifesto. Taking questions from journalists after claiming Labour's pledges created a multibillion pound "black hole", they were asked about reports of a rift between their offices since the U-turn over National Insurance in March's Budget. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether they would "still be neighbours" after the general election - the chancellor's official residence is 11 Downing Street - Mrs May said: "I think it's true to say that the chancellor and I and every other member of my team are focused on 8 June." She was also pressed to give an endorsement of her chancellor, replying that she was "very happy to do so". "As Philip says, we have worked together for many years," she said. "Longer than we would care to identify - that's an age-related comment, nothing else." Mr Hammond said he and Mrs May worked "very closely together". He added: "What I candidly admitted - and my family will confirm this - is I do occasionally swear." This morning the chancellor's admission that he sometimes swears, as he sought to play down reports of rows with Team May, won't have helped. Nor will the PM twice refusing to say he would still be her chancellor if she is elected. She did, at the third time of asking give him her endorsement. And moving him after the election if the Tories win would be a dramatic and risky move. But this morning's excursion won't have helped relations between the two addresses. Read Laura's blog	Prime Minister Theresa May has laughed off questions about whether Chancellor Philip Hammond would still be in place after the general election.
Four masked men forced their way into the house in Dunraven Avenue around 22:15 BST on Friday. Two remained with the man while the other two searched the house. The gang left a short time later without taking anything from the property. Police have appealed for anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity to contact them.	A man in his 70s has been left shaken but uninjured after a burglary at his home in east Belfast.
26 January 2015 Last updated at 09:11 GMT The trees were part of an area known as 'Doggerland' which formed part of a much bigger area before it was flooded by the North Sea. It was once so big that hunter-gatherers who lived in the area could have walked to Germany, in Europe, across its land. The underwater forest was discovered by Dawn Watson and Rob Spray from Sea Search on a diving trip to study marine life. The prehistoric forest lay undiscovered until it was exposed by the extreme storms along the east of England coast in December 2013. Check out this underwater footage of the forest which experts believe could date back more than 10,000 years. Underwater diving footage is copyright and courtesy of Rob Spray and Dawn Watson.	Nature experts have discovered an amazing underwater forest thousands of years old under the sea close to the Norfolk coast in England.
The annual Roald Dahl Funny Prize is to be relaunched in 2016 as part of the author's centenary celebrations. Set up by former children's laureate Michael Rosen in 2008, the prize is intended to reward authors and artists of humorous children's books. A spokesman for the Dahl Literary Estate said they looked forward to making the prize "even more impactful". The prize was created as a joint enterprise between book charity Booktrust, the Roald Dahl literary estate and Rosen. 'Robust future' "We are delighted with the success that the Roald Dahl Funny Prize has achieved in a fairly short amount of time," said Luke Kelly of Dahl & Dahl. "The Prize has paid tribute to many fantastically talented, inventive and mischievous storytellers." Booktrust boss Viv Bird said the prize had been a "phenomenal triumph" but she wanted to ensure "a robust future for this unique celebration of funny books". Last year's winners, Simon Rickerty (Monkey Nut) and Jim Smith (I Am Not A Loser), received Â£2,500 each.	A children's book prize inspired by Matilda author Roald Dahl has been put on hold for two years.
The Buglife conservation charity says the recent period of damp weather has seen the numbers of bees, wasps, moths and butterflies shrink in 2012. Its chief executive Matt Shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather, then it could prove dangerous for some rare species. "They might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction," he said. This year saw the wettest April-June quarter on record and further heavy rain in July. Mr Shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on, which has reduced their numbers. It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added. He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the UK need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen. "We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on." Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect "massive year-on-year variation" which they have reported this year. However, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and Mr Shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the UK. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said. However, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions. "This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year," Mr Shardlow said. "We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails." But Richard Ridler, chairman of Essex Beekeepers' Association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens. "The problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that I would have expected this year. "So the public saw a lot less of them. I haven't had beekeepers telling me that they've lost more bees than usual. "This has been the most unusual, bizarre beekeeping year because of the weather. Most beekeepers I've spoken to have written this year off as an interesting experience, and one they hope not to have again for a while."	Some species of insects are at "very low numbers" in the UK after months of wet and cool weather, experts say.
11 May 2016 Last updated at 08:17 BST Matthew Oliver paid more than one thousand pounds for the seed which came from the current world record holder grown in Switzerland. The winning pumpkin weighs 165 stone, so Matthew's would need to weigh-in at more than a tonne to beat that.	It may be five months until Halloween, but for one gardener it'll be a nail biting wait to see if his seed grows into the biggest pumpkin in the world.
The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to "all the victims of the conflict", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's "resolute efforts" to end the conflict. "The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process," Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency Mr Santos said on Twitter: "This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace." The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: "What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement." It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: "I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible." Earlier, he had written: "The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets." This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as "encouragement" to the rebels. "Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. "The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

The government has been accused of failing to do more to help 2.6 million women born in the 1950s who have lost out because of changes to pension law. The SNP's Mhairi Black said it was "laughable" the problem could not be fixed when the government had found £1bn to fund its deal with the DUP. Minister Guy Opperman said he would look at cases of financial hardship. But he faced shouts of "shame on you" when he said the government was "actually doing a significant amount" to address the individual difficulties of older workers trying to enter the labour market - including by offering them apprenticeships. Mr Opperman, setting out the government's work on "lifelong learning" said: "The reality is over 200,000 people over 60 have entered further education since 2014/15. "We have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. "Such apprenticeships in England, for example, in 2014/15... 12% of the starting apprenticeships were for those aged 45." Mr Opperman was heckled by MPs as he outlined the details. Labour's Graham Jones, raising a point of order, said: "I'm struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?" The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women - Women Against State Pension Inequality - whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020. Ms Black said she had been contacted by a woman who said her friend had committed suicide after the general election result "because she could not face what was going to happen to her". "Citizens committing suicide over an issue that could be solved like that - an issue the government could do a U-turn on at any given moment," she said. Ms Black said it was "an absolute disgrace" that a debate on the issue was having to be held again. Turning to Mr Opperman, a pensions minister, she said it was "laughable" that the government "can find a billion pounds for a deal to cling on to power, but we cannot find the money to give women the pensions that they are due". "The only other two things they are guilty of is being born in the 50s and the fact they are women." Labour's Carolyn Harris said the government "has betrayed these women - they've stolen their security and they've shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements".	A minister has been heckled by MPs for suggesting women over 60 facing poverty could start an apprenticeship.
Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week. And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture. "He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in," McCarthy told BBC Scotland. "Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner. "He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good. "Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now." As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic. Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble. "I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong," McCarthy said. "It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money." Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons. He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013. There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers. Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old. "He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years," he added. "The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season." And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees. "Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example," McCarthy added. "He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence."	Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.
It was delivered by a politician with "big ambitions". George Osborne's stated aim was to create what he called a "new settlement". That's politician's code for re-writing the rules of politics to suit your side. So it is that he did something rather surprising - slowing and softening spending and welfare cuts now having promised faster and deeper cuts in the run up to the election. So it is that he adopted a series of Labour policies - a higher re-badged minimum wage, a levy on firms to pay for apprentices, an assault on the tax privilege of so-called non doms. This in addition to delivering Tory promises to cut income tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax. But hold on - below those headlines are some potentially eye-watering cuts to benefits - the cuts to tax credits for families will dwarf the pay rise many will get. There are cuts too to Whitehall budgets on the same scale as seen over the past five years - though where they'll hit is as yet unspelt out. And there are tax rises - on buying insurance, on buying a car, on pensions - which dwarf the headline tax cuts. So, yes, it was a "big Budget" - whether it's a big game-changer, a big mess or a big outrage is a judgement for you.	It was indeed a "big" Budget - just as the chancellor said it would be.
The women, aged between 18 and 29, have been recruited on social media. Five of them are now living with IS militants in the conflict zones, according to a special investigation by Victoria Police. Concern has been rising since mid-2014 about Australians going to the Middle East to fight for IS. The government will soon introduce legislation allowing it to strip dual citizens fighting in Iraq or Syria of their Australian citizenship. People working in Australia to support militant groups will also be targeted by the changes. Task Force Pax was established in April to monitor Victorians believed to be involved with insurgents. Officials from the task force told local media on Friday that another four Melbourne women made it as far as Turkey before being turned back by authorities. One other was stopped by customs officers in Australia while two remain unaccounted for. The young women are all from Melbourne's northern and south-eastern suburbs. Assistant Commissioner Tracy Linford said two forensic psychologists had been embedded in the task force to help investigators understand why the young women were trying to join IS. "The use of psychologists provides us with a far more comprehensive risk assessment and also assists in identifying early intervention opportunities," she said. "This gives us the chance to focus on identifying those youths most at risk of radicalisation and to engage with them or their families directly." Local media reported that one of the women was 21-year-old Zehra Duman, who allegedly travelled overseas in December to join Mahmoud Abullatif, a Melbourne man believed to be a Islamic extremist. She travelled to Syria without her parent's knowledge, The Age newspaper reported. It is believed Abullatif was killed while fighting with IS in January but Ms Duman has yet to return home. Police said the young women were being sold a romantic view of life with IS, and had lied to their families about their travel plans. Authorities were warning parents and friends of young women about the lure of IS, saying the women could end up in arranged marriages, or forced into sexual servitude in the Middle East. "Our intelligence tells us these women are going over there to meet their partners, to marry somebody in an arranged marriage or be pushed into sexual servitude," Assistant Commissioner Linford told reporters. The Herald Sun newspaper said mother Dullel Kassab was another of the women identified by police. The Australian government believes at least 100 Australians are fighting with militant groups in the Middle East. Another 150 people in Australia are known to be supporting such groups, while Australia's intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), is investigating about 400 high-priority terrorist cases.	As many as 12 young women have tried to leave Melbourne to join the Islamic State (IS) militant group, according to Australian police.
The 33-year-old, who is the younger brother of Harlequins number eight Nick, joined Sale in 2011 after six years at Northampton. Easter won the European Challenge Cup and reached the Champions Cup final at Saints after joining from Nottingham. "I've enjoyed my time at Sale, I didn't really want to go anywhere else," said the back-row forward. "It was the right time to leave on my own terms, which not many people do. "I've had the chance for these last few games just to enjoy and savour them and I've been really lucky." He will now take up his teaching position at Wrekin College in Shropshire after the final game of the season at Newcastle on Saturday. "The last few years, I've been tailoring my career towards teaching, so taking a few courses, getting into schools, teaching and coaching," he added. "The opportunity just came up at the right time. It felt like the right time for me and my family."	Sale Sharks forward Mark Easter has announced he will retire at the end of the season to take up a teaching role.
A statement from Greaves's family said the 75-year-old, who had a minor stroke in 2012, had been taken ill on Sunday. Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 England games and a club-record 220 league goals for Tottenham having started his career at Chelsea. "His wife Irene and four children have asked for privacy during what is a worrying time," added the statement. "Jimmy had a minor stroke in 2012, but appeared to have made a full recovery. "He was due to be inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 13 May at a sell-out ceremony at White Hart Lane." Greaves is fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. He was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad but originally missed out on a medal because he was injured during the tournament's group stage. At the time, only the 11 winning players on the pitch at the end of the final received the award, although football's governing body Fifa changed that practice in 2007. The World Cup squad players and the families of team manager Sir Alf Ramsey and other backroom staff were finally presented with medals in 2009. Tottenham posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed shortly after the news of Greaves's stroke emerged. "Everyone at the club wishes Jimmy Greaves a speedy recovery after he suffered a stroke yesterday," the message read. "Our thoughts are with Jimmy and his family at this difficult time." Greaves scored 124 league goals for Chelsea, then a club record, between 1957 and 1961. Chelsea tweeted: "All at Chelsea are thinking of former Blue Jimmy Greaves and his family at this time. We wish him a full and swift recovery." England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 final, said on Twitter: "Thinking of my friend and one of our greats this morning. Wishing him all the best and hoping for a speedy recovery." Hurst replaced Greaves in the England team in 1966 after he injured a shin against France during the group stages. Greaves helped Tottenham win the FA Cup in 1962 and 1967, while his career also included spells at AC Milan and West Ham United. In the 1980s he forged a new career as a football pundit on ITV, most notably alongside former Liverpool striker Ian St John on 'Saint and Greavsie', which ran from 1985 to 1992. Former Tottenham striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: "Choked to read that Jimmy Greaves has had a severe stroke. One of my absolute heroes. Thoughts are with him and his family. Get well, Jimmy."	Former England and Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves is in intensive care after suffering a severe stroke.
Jamie Bishop, who was 44, was a left-handed batsman who also represented Wales at minor county level. Glamorgan cricket club chief executive Hugh Morris described him as "a hugely talented cricketer" who had an outstanding record for Pontarddulais cricket club. South Wales Police is not treating the death as suspicious. Tributes were also paid on social media, from sporting figures including Steve James, Edward Bevan, Sean Holley, John Devereux and Rick O'Shea.	Tributes have been paid to a former Glamorgan cricketer who was found dead at his Swansea flat on Friday.
Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet. This makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China. Despite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country. Perhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party. He is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say. "What are they going to do, come and take me away?" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home. Positive outlook Mr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse. He was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong. Nevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there. Several years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. "It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism," he said, laughing. Mr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. "There are good aspects to even bad things," he said. That does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way. His daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. A common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to "learn from the masses". Mr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China. "It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things," he said, unable to stop himself laughing again. Despite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck. When the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country. He initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language. At first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend. It was a decision that probably saved his life. A few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad. "All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled 'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it," he said. It was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh. Dark future? The work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language. When he started work on developing Pinyin, 85% of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent. There had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally. "We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters," he said. Having lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters. One of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao. Mr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing. During one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives. "Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife," he said. "It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food." Mr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country. "China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't," said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books. It is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic. Does he ever regret that decision? "We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator," said Mr Zhou. "But I don't regret coming back - there's no point," he added, laughing again.	Students struggling to learn Chinese might not know it, but their task has been made easier because of the work of one man.
Reports in France suggest the Borussia Monchengladbach winger will stand by his decision at the 2015 Nations Cup to take a break from internationals. The 27-year-old made the announcement after a quarter-final loss to Ghana. "The time has come for me to reconsider my international career in order to focus on my club," he said. Guinea coach Luis Fernandez, who only took charge of the Syli Nationale in April, has named Traore in a 23-man squad for the 6 September fixture. But veteran defender Kamil Zayatte, who has been overlooked by Fernandez, has admitted that his playing days are truly over after the latest omission. "No, it's fine. All is well," Zayatte told French radio station RFI. "It is the choice of the coach and I respect him. It's time for me now to move on. Good luck Syli ". Trabzonspor's Kevin Constante and Spain-based Alhassane Bangoura are also in the squad. But there is no room for Bouna Sarr, who turned down the chance to play for Guinea at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea and against Swaziland in June. Tiny Swaziland stunned Guinea 2-1 in a horror debut for former France World Cup star Fernandez as qualification for the Nations Cup in Gabon began in June. Diminutive attacker Tony Tsabedze scored both goals in the Group L clash, hosted in Morocco because Guinea are banned from staging international matches following the Ebola outbreak in the country.	Ibrahima Traore looks set to reject a call-up to the Guinea squad for September's 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Zimbabwe.

Donald Swanson was born at Geise, near Thurso, and went on to become one of Britain's best Victorian detectives. Here, historian Alan McIvor, author Adam Wood, who is writing a book about Mr Swanson, and Mr Swanson's family reveal details of his early life and his work in tackling some of the 1800s most shocking crimes. Donald Swanson was born at Geise Distillery, about two miles from Thurso, on 12 August 1848. He was the youngest child of brewer John Swanson and his wife Mary. The distillery, which closed in 1851, is now long gone and ruined buildings now mark the spot. Mr Swanson was still a boy when his family left Geise and moved to a home in Thurso's Durness Street. He attended Robert Meikle's Parish School in Thurso's Market Place, before going to the Miller Institution. After leaving school, Mr Swanson was a teacher for a time at the Miller Institution, which is today a public library. In 1867, Mr Swanson left on a horse-drawn stagecoach with the aim of getting himself to London. His 83-year-old granddaughter Mary Berkin said: "When you are 20 the world is your oyster and I suppose he thought 'if I get on that stagecoach I will get to London eventually and make my fortune'." In 1868, the young man joined the Metropolitan Police. Mr Swanson rose through the ranks and earned promotions to sergeant, detective inspector and detective chief inspector in 1888 - the year of Jack the Ripper's murder of five women in the Whitechapel area. In 1896 he was made superintendent of the force's criminal investigation department. During his long career in the police, Mr Swanson handled investigations into some of the worst crimes of the Victorian age. He was involved in the arrest of murderer Percy Lefroy Mapleton in 1881. Mapleton planned a robbery on a train from London to Brighton. He targeted a former stockbroker, killing the man by throwing him out of a carriage after unsuccessfully shooting at him with a revolver. Mr Swanson was involved in two other major investigations that same year. One led to the recovery of jewellery worth Â£250,000 stolen from a Lady Alice Bective. Later, Mr Swanson found himself back in Scotland tasked with hunting down a gang of grave robbers who stole the body of an aristocrat and demanded a ransom for its return. A stone cross still marks the spot where the Earl of Crawford's body was found unceremoniously buried in woods near Dunecht in Aberdeenshire. In 1884, the detective helped in the hunt for those responsible for a prolonged bombing campaign, and four years later tackled his most gruesome case. Jack the Ripper murdered five women in the Whitechapel area of London. In private notes, Mr Swanson named "Kosminski" as the killer. In more modern times, writers have named Polish-born Aaron Kosminski as a suspect. Mr Kosminski, a hairdresser who arrived in England in 1882, had a history of mental illness. He was allegedly spotted at the scene of the murder of Elizabeth Stride, believed to be the Ripper's third victim. Mr Wood said: "According to Swanson's annotations, Kosminski was a prime suspect. "He went insane and was committed to an asylum where he died shortly afterwards." In 1903, the Scottish detective, who frequently returned to Thurso for holidays, retired on a pension of Â£280-a-year. He died in Surrey on 24 November 1924 and was buried at Kingston cemetery. Mr Swanson's police rattle was brought to the unveiling ceremony in Thurso by his family. Rattles were carried by Metropolitan Police officers until the 1880s as a means of raising an alarm. Whistles replaced rattles because the sound from a whistle travelled further. "The things that he and the other police at the time had to look at, probe at and find out about - I wonder how they could stomach that," said Mrs Berkin, who unveiled the new memorial outside Thurso Police Station earlier this week with the policeman's great grandson Nevill Swanson. Historian Mr McIvor added: "He was something else. The career he had was incredible. The fact he came from Thurso is absolutely fantastic."	A memorial has been unveiled in a Scottish town in honour of a teacher-turned-police officer who investigated the murders of Jack the Ripper.
Johnson scored 15 goals in 41 games for the Heed this season, having signed in July 2015 following his release by Championship side Cardiff City. The 23-year-old has also previously had spells with Stevenage and Tranmere. "If you have someone who is capable of scoring goals, then it's important that you re-sign him," manager Neil Aspin told the club website. "At the age he is, I believe he can get better, too." Gateshead finished ninth in the National League, 13 points outside the play-off places.	Gateshead striker Danny Johnson has signed a two-year contract extension with the National League club.
Chelsea, the reigning Premier League champions, losing at home to Burnley (that's Burnley, the team that won once away in the whole of 2016-17) on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It is, of course, very early days. But should Antonio Conte be worried? History suggests he should. It's been eight years since a side staged a successful defence of the Premier League title, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2008-09. And going back even further, since 2006-07 the Scot is one of only two managers - along with Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini - to win the title and still be in his job come the end of the following May. Carlo Ancelotti (Chelsea, 2009-10), Roberto Mancini (Manchester City, 2011-12), Jose Mourinho (Chelsea, 2014-15) and Claudio Ranieri (Leicester, 2015-16) were all gone 12 months after winning English top flight's biggest prize. That's four of the six title-winning managers before Conte. There's also David Moyes, who took over a side just crowned champions under the retiring Ferguson but who failed to make it to the end of his first season in charge. And if that's not enough to worry Chelsea's Italian manager, what about these stats? Chelsea are only the second reigning Premier League champions to lose the opening game of the following campaign (after Leicester last season). They are also the first title holders to concede three goals in the opening game of the next season, and the first side to pick up two red cards on day one. Worrying times. At least, not in August. There's probably not a single person in your office who did not have Harry Kane in their Fantasy Football team, and why not? The Tottenham striker was the Premier League's top scorer last season with 29 goals. However, there's a strange statistic about the deadly finisher - he has not scored a single goal in August in 11 Premier League appearances.  Not one. With six efforts against Newcastle, no-one had more shots on goal this weekend than Kane. The ball just would not go in the net. Spend that Fantasy Football cash elsewhere... Conte might have had a nightmare on Saturday but one manager certain to have slept soundly was David Wagner. The Huddersfield boss led the Premier League new boys to a stunning 3-0 win at Crystal Palace, a result which meant the Terriers spent a night as the leaders of England's top flight for the first time since 18 August 1970. Only a last-minute goal by Paul Pogba for Manchester United against the Hammers on Sunday denied the Terriers top spot heading into the second round of fixtures. But we're sure Huddersfield fans will get over that disappointment when they read this statistic - of the 14 previous teams to win their Premier League opener following promotion, only four have gone on to be relegated. If you watched Match of the Day on Saturday then you might have been scratching your head at the addition of a new statistic on the end-of-match stats - expected goals. The metric is designed to assess every chance and determine how many goals a team should score in a game. Still confused? Head here to read more. This weekend marked the first time "expected goals" had been rolled out for the Premier League, so what did it tell us? What stands out from the table below is that Burnley and Huddersfield were clinical. Very clinical. They both scored three goals in their respective games, despite their xG value being low. In fact, they are the only two teams to win their games despite having a lower xG value than their opponent. What does that mean? Well, if your cup is half full it bodes well as they were clinical when they had half-chances. But if you're of a slightly more pessimistic persuasion, it also suggests they conceded the kind of chances that, ordinarily, other teams will capitalise on. It also shows that Southampton should have beaten Swansea comfortably but wasteful finishing let them down. Speaking of taking your chances, Huddersfield's record signing - Steve Mounie - had a debut that will live long in his memory. The Benin international, signed from Montpellier in the summer for a club-record £12m, scored two goals from his first two shots in English football. Talk about a way to make an impression. There was also double delight for Romelu Lukaku on his Manchester United debut. The Belgium international made an instant impression at Old Trafford by getting two  goals in Sunday's 4-0 win against West Ham. Lukaku now has 11 goals against the Hammers, more than against any other English side. Is it rare to score more than one goal on your Premier League debut? Forty-three players have bagged a double in their first appearance but only one has managed a hat-trick - Fabrizio Ravanelli for Middlesbrough in 1996. The first debutant to score this weekend was Alexandre Lacazette. Arsenal's record signing did so with his first shot, and his second touch, as a Premier League player; just one minute and 34 seconds into Friday's 4-3 win at Leicester. Unfortunately for Frank de Boer, his Premier League debut was not one he'll want to remember for long. The former Netherlands international was appointed Crystal Palace boss in the summer but the Eagles' surprise defeat by Huddersfield at Selhurst Park makes it one of the worst home debuts for a manager in Premier League history. Alan Smith will have sympathy, although probably not much. His Palace home debut in August 1994 ended with a 6-1 loss to Liverpool. Everton boss Ronald Koeman said Wayne Rooney was "still one of the best in his position" after he scored the only goal in his team's win over Stoke. Rooney himself said it was a "special moment" full of relief and emotion". It also set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between goals for the same team. His last league strike for the club he supported as a boy was in a 1-1 draw against Leeds on 13 April 2004. A few months later he was starring for England at Euro 2004 - before moving to Manchester United shortly before the transfer window closed. His winner on Saturday came 4,869 days after his goal at Elland Road. His header also means that he has now been involved in 300 Premier League goals - scoring 199 of them with a further 101 assists. Only Alan Shearer has been involved in more - with 324. There was no Rooney at Old Trafford on Sunday, of course, but that did not affect Manchester United's incredible opening-day pedigree. The Red Devils' 4-0 thumping of West Ham was their 17th round-one win in 26 Premier League seasons. Conversely, no top-flight team has lost more season openers than the Hammers (11). The victory was also Jose Mourinho's biggest as Manchester United manager and his biggest home win in the Premier League since Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 in March 2014. It's a bit of a familiar sight for Newcastle fans - seeing one of their players sent off. Jonjo Shelvey's second-half dismissal against Tottenham was the fourth time a Magpies player has been sent off in their Premier League opener. Only Arsenal (six) and Charlton (five) have had more opening-day red cards. In total there were three reds shown at the weekend, with the remaining two coming at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea's Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas were sent off. That's quite a lot to kick the season off with, but not the most in Premier League history. The most red cards on an opening weekend is four, an unwanted record set in the 1994-95 and 2003-04 seasons. Back when the Premier League was launched in 1992, Eric Cantona was the first, and only, French player involved. Since then, 199 players have made the short trip across the Channel to play in English football's top flight, with Newcastle's Florian Lejeune becoming the latest on Sunday. The defender was also the 27th Frenchman to play for the Magpies in the Premier League. Follow Match of the Day on Instagram for the best photos from the world of football.	No-one saw it coming.
Media playback is unsupported on your device 13 January 2015 Last updated at 16:34 GMT Adelaide and Victoria in southern Australia have seen some of the worst bushfires for 30 years. Injured possums, koalas, kangaroos and wallabies have been arriving at animal rescue centres almost every day. A charity called IFAW appealed for the public to sew tiny mittens, to help protect koalas that had burned paws. So many people sent in mittens, they received enough to last them for a year. Now the charity has asked people to sew comfy pouches help the injured baby kangaroos, called joeys, recover. The pouches help keep the babies warm but have to be changed after every feed, so up to six pouches are needed for each animal every day. The animals are being looked after by keepers at Adelaide Zoo. Once they're better they will be released back to the wild.	Wildlife sanctuaries across southern Australia have been helping injured animals - by asking the public to sew mittens and pouches!
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that 2,500 homes were repossessed in April, May and June, down from 3,000 in the previous quarter. This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. "This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular," said CML director general Paul Smee. "As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening." Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than Â£1.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said. Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance. Ministry of Justice figures, also published on Thursday, show that the number of homeowners in England and Wales facing court action at the earliest stage of the repossession process fell during the second quarter of the year. However, the number of tenants evicted by landlords in the second quarter of the year rose by 4% compared with the same period last year, to 10,361. Seasonally adjusted figures show a 1% decrease compared to the first three months of the year. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: "These figures are a stark warning that relentless rent rises and welfare cuts have contributed to thousands of hard-pressed families losing their home."	The number of homes repossessed in the UK fell again in the second quarter of the year as fewer owners fell behind on mortgage repayments.
Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a "landmark" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. Ministers said young people who took them were "taking exceptional risks with their health". A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to "any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect", the government said. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or "hippy crack" - for human use. What are legal highs? The government said the "legitimate sale" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would "fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances". They would end the "game of cat and mouse" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said. He added: "The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach." Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible. Commander Simon Bray, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: "A blanket ban on new psychoactive substances will make it simpler for law enforcement to deal with those drugs which are potentially unsafe but which may not yet be controlled."	A new "blanket ban" on so-called legal highs will carry prison sentences of up to seven years, the government says.
Australia's foreign minister said these were "not the actions of a friend". The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot. The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia's decision was disappointing. Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was "not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries". At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January. The originals belonged to Australians living in Israel. The Australian government said a police investigation had left it in no doubt that the Israeli authorities were behind "the abuse and counterfeiting of the passports". As a result Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked Israel to withdraw a diplomat, whom he did not identify "The decision to ask Israel to remove from Australia one of its officers at the Israeli embassy in Canberra is not something which fills the Australian government with any joy," he said. "On the contrary, the decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger." Passports from France, Ireland, Germany and Britain were used in the operation, and in March, the British government expelled an Israeli diplomat from London. The Israeli government has said there is no proof that it was behind the killing, although Dubai officials have said they are 99.9% sure that agents from Mossad were responsible.	Australia has expelled an Israeli diplomat saying Israel was behind the forging of Australian passports linked to the murder of a Hamas operative in Dubai.
Jak Trueman, 15, was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour. His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: "Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven." She added: "God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx." The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd. The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond. The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell. On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: "I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. "I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. "Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile." At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity. The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months. He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked. Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school. On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment. At the time, Jak wrote: "This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have. "I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. "I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me." In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike. More money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.	A terminally ill schoolboy whose inspirational story helped to raise more than £35,000 for charity in the past week has died.
Sir Christopher Pitchford, the inquiry's chairman, said he recognised the public interest in proceedings being "as open as possible". The senior judge said he would assess each anonymity request individually. The Metropolitan Police has already asked for large parts of the investigation to be in private. Campaigners who say they were wronged during operations dating back decades are calling for maximum disclosure. They include women who did not realise their partners were undercover officers, and a long list of social justice campaigners who are trying to establish whether they were unfairly monitored. The preliminary ruling means that there will be no blanket restrictions on material relating to undercover operations being disclosed if Sir Christopher rules the public interest lies in disclosing them. Some 33 individuals, nine of them former undercover police officers, have already asked for anonymity. Scotland Yard, backed by the government, has also argued it should not be forced to admit to the existence of some operations. Undercover Inquiry: Why it matters - what's at stake? Deceived women: Who has received an apology from the police? In an 85-page ruling, Sir Christopher says that the inquiry will have to grapple with seemingly "irreconcilable" arguments over whether the public interest lies in keeping sensitive police information secret and protecting the true identities of former undercover officers - or in disclosing past events because of public concerns. "The starting point is that no restriction order will be made, in the public interest of openness in the Inquiry and its proceedings, unless it is necessary in the countervailing public interest of the protection of individuals from harm and/or effective policing," says the ruling. "It is not possible to state at the level of principle or generality where the public interest balance will rest. "The Chairman will approach evaluation on a case-by-case basis according to the nature and quality of evidence received in support of the application." One woman who was deceived into an undercover relationship, known only as "Lisa", said she was not optimistic that the ruling would lead to the truth coming out - saying she feared the inquiry had failed to recognise there was a duty to reveal the truth to people who had been victims. "I'm glad that they have not been allowed to have blanket anonymity," she told the BBC. "But my biggest fear is that the police will be able to drag this out. "They won't give up a single piece of information without applying for restriction orders. "It took four-and-a-half years for me to get an apology in my case." The ruling stresses that police officers who want to remain anonymous will have to provide evidence of the possible harm they could be exposed to, if named in public. This would have to include evidence about the nature or gravity of the risk an individual would face and complex arguments about whether naming someone would breach their human rights. Similarly, forces will have to show how disclosure of operational details would cause damage to undercover policing. The Metropolitan Police, backed by other police chiefs and government, had argued that it should be allowed simply to "neither confirm nor deny" details of operations. Sir Christopher must now start assessing the 33 current applications for publicity restrictions and whether any of them need to be backed up by further evidence. In June, Sir Christopher will also begin considering if the state must be forced to tell parents of dead children that their child's identity was used to create fake personas for undercover officers.	Undercover police officers facing claims of wrongdoing will not automatically get anonymity at a forthcoming major public inquiry.
Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to "turn doubters into believers". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: "Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try." And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: "We decide when it's over." This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of "You'll Never Walk Alone" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: "When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match." Klopp added: "It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories." There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: "We're going to have a lot of fun with this player." Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of "a win for the Liverpool country" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous "This Is Anfield" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: "I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big." Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.	Liverpool won a game that will be talked about for generations - a Europa League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund that will live forever in the memory of all at Anfield.
He was appointed by Nigel Farage in 2014. Nevertheless, he still thinks he enjoys the support of the majority of UKIP members. Now he must convince party members in north Wales to put him on top of their list of candidates for May's assembly election. In each of the assembly's five regions, UKIP's candidates will be ranked in a ballot of party members. Mr Gill says he fought for that ballot inside the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Some were worried about candidates imposed on them from outside Wales - candidates like former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton. Mr Gill won't be drawn on individuals. It's up to members to decide, he says. But some say Mr Gill didn't do enough - that the entire selection process should have been handled in Wales and that Mr Gill should stand down "I've worked in Wales for UKIP for 11 years. I know the vast majority of members. I've canvassed with people all over Wales in every single area," he says. "I know the quality of the people that we've got, the passionate membership, the capability that we have. And I've stood up for them. "And maybe some of the members haven't seen that because it's happened behind closed doors. But I've stood up for Wales." Critics in other parties, who dismiss UKIP as anti-Welsh, will raise an eyebrow at that statement. But the critics in his own party are the bigger problem. And because the decisions on how candidates are selected were taken in three private NEC meetings, unless those critics were in the room they have to take Mr Gill at his word. "There are people obviously who don't like me. There are people who do like me. But I think the people who back me by far outweigh those who don't." Some of those speaking out are motivated by "personal reasons", he thinks, having changed their minds about standing as candidates. And those who say he fails to represent the rank-and-file are talking "nonsense". Compared to the other parties, UKIP's selection procedure has been messy. But UKIP sells itself as the antidote to other parties. Despite being an MEP, Mr Gill doesn't see himself as part of a political class. Perhaps that's not surprising in a climate where politicians are routinely traduced. Who would identify themselves as members of the political class? I met him his at his home - a family-run bed and breakfast on Anglesey where he and his wife Jana are raising their five children. Does part of him think he could do without the flack from those who want him to quit? "Part of me does think that of course, I'm human. I've got a beautiful family. I've got a life outside politics." So why carry on? "Because we have the most important election in Wales for us in five years. We must get UKIP representation in that assembly. "And also, very likely in five or six months time we will have the whole raison d'etre of UKIP. "The whole reason why I joined UKIP is that referendum whether or not Britain should be a member of European Union. "Whether we should be governed by Brussels or whether we think we're big enough to make our own laws. "That is why I joined the party. I can't give up at the last hurdle."	Unlike the other four main party leaders in Wales, Nathan Gill wasn't elected by his party members.
However, she said there were "many, many other questions" about Brexit and there was "still a lot to do". The UK proposal was unveiled by Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. It would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years a new "UK settled status". That would allow them to stay in the country and access health, education and other benefits. The plan would affect 3.2 million EU citizens now living in the UK. Their rights - and the rights of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - are among the thorny issues that have to be resolved early on in Brexit talks, along with the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. "Theresa May made clear today that EU citizens who have been in Great Britain for five years can keep their full rights. That's a good start," said Mrs Merkel at the end of Thursday's talks. "But of course there are many, many other questions about Brexit - about finances, about the relationship with Ireland - which means we still have a lot to do until October." She insisted that Brexit was not the focus of the summit - the UK's split from the EU is being negotiated separately. "For me the shaping of the future of the 27 is a priority coming before the issue of the negotiations with Britain on the exit," she added. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At the summit, the PM sought to reassure the 27 other EU states, saying the UK "does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up". "No-one will face a cliff edge," she said. The UK stunned the EU when it voted to end its membership in a referendum a year ago on Friday. The exit deadline is 30 March 2019. The summit's final day is to focus on migration, security and economic issues. Counter-terrorism has been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. Both sides would like to get the issue of citizens' rights wrapped up as soon as possible - it would be good for morale to get an early win, and they have more difficult issues to tackle. But while there is a sense that progress can be made, there are still some tricky technical questions to deal with. Which rights will be extended to immediate family members living elsewhere - to children in particular? And who will guarantee citizens' rights in the event of any legal dispute? The EU has already insisted that the European Court of Justice should be involved; the UK insists that British courts should uphold the deal. It is also not clear what the cut-off date should be for citizens to qualify for any offer that is agreed. The UK proposal suggests a date between March 2017 and March 2019 - although it is highly unlikely that the EU would be willing to accept a date that has already passed. From an EU perspective, what we've heard so far from the UK side remains rather vague. EU negotiators will want to see the details of this proposal which are only due to be made public next Monday.	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described UK plans to ensure the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit as "a good start".
Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009. Mrs Cameron told the Times: "Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant." She also said it changed her husband's outlook. "I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective." David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died. Mrs Cameron said: "From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with. "It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal." When Ivan died, she said, the outside world "became meaningless". "Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice." The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010. Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street. "We tried to make the flat feel like a home. "Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening." They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square. "So I did plan quite carefully." She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph. "At the last minute we would panic and think, 'Oh God, it's the holiday photo... "I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose." Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn. Before her husband became Prime Minister, she was creative director for Smythson, which makes luxury leather goods.	Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former Prime Minister, has said their son's death "overshadowed everything".
The victim was taken to hospital from Crown Street, Acton, on Friday but died from his injuries. A 16-year-old suspect was arrested and remains in custody in South London, police said. Officers are continuing to question a 17-year-old arrested near the scene on suspicion of murder, the Met said. Police believe they know the identity of the dead youth but it has yet to be formally confirmed. Det Ch Insp Rebecca Reeves said the street would have been busy at the time of the stabbing and asked for anyone with information to come forward. She added: "We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw or heard an argument outside a cafe on Crown Street."	A second teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a west London street.
A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is "considering" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: "People just see us as barmaids in the sky. "They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before." In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: "The code of conduct isn't working… We're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem." Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty-free shop to consume on the plane, she was told "officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays "clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. "I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. "Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. "We can't allow it not to change." A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: "We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon." The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, "and will respond in due course". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: "I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly." She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.	Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a Panorama investigation has revealed.
More than 700,000 employees face unpaid leave due to the shutdown which was triggered after the two houses of Congress did not agree on a new budget. Hyundai said affected employees who currently own its vehicles will be given a payment relief "for as long as they are out of work". Employees looking to buy a new car will be given a 90-day payment deferral. "We recognize the impact on family budgets that the furlough will drive," John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement. Hyundai had offered a similar scheme, the Hyundai Assurance programme, during the peak of the global financial crisis four years ago to help consumers who had lost their jobs. Many analysts have said that the move had helped the South Korean firm win customer loyalty and boosted its sales in recent years. The company said that its latest offer to help the federal employees was an addition to that programme and aimed at "helping workers at a time when they most need it". "Like we did almost four years ago when we launched Hyundai Assurance, this is our way of saying 'We've got your back' during this uncertain time," Mr Krafcik said. Under the latest offer, Hyundai will extend all auto loan and lease payments during the shutdown for current Hyundai owners who are put on unpaid leave. The programme is available to all customers who have financed their purchase or lease through Hyundai Finance America.	Hyundai Motor will defer payments due from US federal employees affected by the partial government shutdown.
Leg-spinner Mason Crane, called into the England Test squad earlier in the day, took 3-21 as the hosts restricted Glamorgan to 118-6 on a slow pitch. Captain James Vince (60 not out) saw Hampshire home with six overs to spare. Meanwhile, Middlesex prevailed in a tight finish at Lord's as Sussex, who needed five runs from the last over for victory, could only manage two. Middlesex posted 147-6 thanks to Stevie Eskinazi's 57 not out from 44 balls and Paul Stirling's 40 from 31, as England seamer Chris Jordan (2-29) impressed. Sussex began their chase well thanks to Chris Nash (64), but only he and Stiaan van Zyl (34) reached double figures as they slumped from 125-4 in the 17th over to 140-7 - with eight runs needed from the final nine balls of the innings. That meant a nervy last over, bowled by seamer Tom Helm - but he began with two dot balls, had Jofra Archer caught off the third, and David Wiese could only manage a two off the fifth ball as Helm held his nerve and Middlesex sneaked home by two runs. It leaves both South Group sides in mid-table on 10 points from 11 games. Meanwhile, Hampshire's spin-heavy tactics were clear from the start with Crane, fellow leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and slow left-armer Liam Dawson taking a combined 6-52 from their 12 overs of spin. Dawson - left out of the Test squad in favour of Crane - took the new ball and made an immediate impact, bowling Aneurin Donald with the third ball of the match. Glamorgan's top order could not get going and only a stand of 53 in the final 6.3 overs between Andrew Salter (37 not out) and Graham Wagg (15 not out) gave them any respectability. But despite losing debutant wicketkeeper Calvin Dickinson in the first over, Hampshire always looked in control of an easy run chase. Vince's unbeaten 60 came off just 41 balls and featured 10 fours, while he was ably assisted by Tom Alsop (28 from 19) and George Bailey (25 not out). It helped Hampshire move to within a point of Glamorgan at the top with two games left. Gloucestershire who have a game in hand, and Somerset occupy the other quarter-final berths, two points ahead of Sussex, Middlesex and Surrey. Who will qualify from the T20 Blast South Group?	Hampshire spun their way to an eight-wicket victory over T20 Blast South Group leaders Glamorgan at Southampton.
Shares in Barclays fell 0.9% after the US Department of Justice sued the bank for alleged mortgage securities fraud. It says Barclays misled investors about the quality of loans backing securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Barclays has rejected the claims Data showed the UK economy grew faster than estimated in the third quarter. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy grew by 0.6% in the July-to-September quarter, compared with the previous estimate of 0.5%. However, the ONS also trimmed its growth estimates for the first and second quarters of the year. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2258, and slid 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1725.	UK shares edged higher in the final trading session before Christmas, with the FTSE 100 ending a shortened session up 4.49 points at 7,068.17.
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich. It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: "The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed." From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous "Why Always Me?" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: "It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup." Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: "Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. "A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa." Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called "triple punishment" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because "it is a clear yes or no decision". An IFAB statement read: "Concerns were raised about video replays slowing the game down and increasing the number of stoppages."	Players who display messages on T-shirts worn underneath their strips will face punishment after new proposals were agreed.
The Accounts Commission said there was a risk services could not be maintained without improvements in the way the council was run. But the report recognised that the council delivered good services at the moment. The authority needs to save Â£22.3m - 10% of its budget - by 2017/18. On top of that, council reserves are low and are projected to fall further, the report said. The Accounts Commission is the public spending watchdog for local government in Scotland. In its report, the commission said the council urgently needed "clearer priorities" in its transformation programme to ensure key projects were completed and savings made. The report recognised the council's "commitment to improvement", but added that it was concerned about the pace of those improvements. Deficiencies highlighted by the commission included financial control and management of resources. The chairman of the commission, Douglas Sinclair, said: "There is a gap between the council's ambition and seeing evidence of that on the ground. This is what East Dunbartonshire needs to address if it is to continue to deliver good quality services in the future."	A public spending watchdog has published "serious concerns" over the financial control of East Dunbartonshire Council.
Two shots were fire through windows of the house in Moneyleck Park at about 22:20 GMT on Monday. The man, who was in the house at the time, received hospital treatment for his injuries. He has since been discharged from hospital.	A man has sustained minor injuries in a gun attack at a house in Rasharkin, County Antrim.
They had no phone signal so were only able to contact the emergency services by using Facebook. The coastguard received the alert just before 23:00 GMT on Saturday and said they found the women from the pictures they sent. A police helicopter took them to hospital for treatment. Dawn Petrie, from the coastguard, said weather conditions at the time were not favourable. "Whenever we got the photograph through, there had been heavy rain, it was misty, it was cold, it was damp," she said. "Fortunately that cloud actually cleared to allow the police helicopter to attempt to attend should the ambulance not have been able to reach them."	Two women, one with a suspected broken leg, have been rescued from Divis Mountain in Belfast.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested at an address in Netherton, West Midlands Police said, and remains in custody. A 65-year-old man was attacked at 18:15 GMT in Owen Street, Kates Hill, Dudley, suffering serious stab wounds to his head, shoulder, chest and back. Police said he was now in a stable condition in hospital. Det Insp Greg Evans said: "Thankfully, the man is... recovering well in hospital. "We are still working to establish a motive for the attack and we are currently questioning a teenage boy, who was arrested yesterday afternoon."	A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on his doorstep in the West Midlands on Tuesday.
League of Gentleman star Steve Pemberton will adapt EF Benson's novels about two ladies who vie for social prestige in small-town England. The characters were previously played by Prunella Scales and Geraldine McEwan in a Channel 4 series in 1985. Richardson, who will play Elizabeth Mapp, said: "I cannot wait to get my teeth into Mapp, and of course, Lucia." "I am so looking forward to a summer of hard work and I hope, great fun," said the Parade's End star. Chancellor - whose recent TV credits include Fleming and The Hour - said she was "thrilled to be playing the glorious Lucia". "I hope I can do justice to EF Benson's wonderful creations," she added The comic drama, set in the 1930s, focuses on the snobberies and pretensions of life in the quaint English town of Tilling - and the rivalry which ensues between the visiting Mrs Emmeline Lucas (Lucia) and Tilling socialite Elizabeth Mapp. "I feel sure viewers will relish their time in Tilling, and will enjoy watching the slyly scheming Mapp take on the gloriously haughty Lucia in a dizzying round of bitter bridge parties, devious dinners and malicious musical evenings," said screenwriter Pemberton. Pemberton - who is currently starring in BBC One drama Happy Valley - described himself as a "long-time fan" of Benson's six "deplorably funny novels". "But be warned," he added "this is no jolly period romp. This is a series about a war. May the worst-behaved woman win." Mark Gatiss, Pemberton's League of Gentleman co-star, will join the cast as Major Benjy in the three hour-long films. No transmission date has been announced.	Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor will take the lead roles in a new BBC One adaptation of Mapp And Lucia.

Defence ministry spokesman Lt Gen Sergei Rudskoi said the Syrian army was poised to defeat IS militants there. But US officials said Russia staged no air strikes in Syria in the past week. The strikes come days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the withdrawal of most Russian forces from Syria. IS militants captured the ancient city of Palmyra last May. Since then it has blown up monumental temples, arches and statues in the Unesco World Heritage site, bringing global condemnation. Meanwhile, IS claimed on Friday it had killed five Russian soldiers in fighting around Palmyra in recent days. Russia has not commented on the claim and there is no independent verification. In recent months, IS has been losing ground to President Bashar al-Assad's forces, rebel groups, and Kurdish militia fighters. Gen Rudskoi told reporters in Moscow that the Syrian army had also seized key hilltop areas near the city of Aleppo and cut supply routes leading to the IS-held city. US Central Command spokesman Patrick Ryder said there had been some bombardments in the Palmyra region but that they were thought to be made by Russian artillery. Russia had withdrawn most if not all of its strike aircraft and there had been little movement of its ground forces, Col Ryder said. Indirect peace talks aimed at resolving the Syrian conflict have been taking place in Geneva for the past week, but so far shown no progress.	Russia says its warplanes are carrying out up to 25 air strikes a day around the Syrian city of Palmyra in support of Syrian forces trying to oust so-called Islamic State (IS).
Ricky Miller ended a run of two games without a goal with a penalty in the 26th minute, sending Liam Roberts the wrong way after his own trickery in the box drew the foul from Chester's Matthew Waters. James Alabi was a constant threat for Chester and he showed great strength with his back to goal to spin and lash home an equaliser on the half-hour mark. Miller then raced clear of the visitors' backline and finished his 29th goal of the season after 49 minutes, before Joe Healy completed the scoring with a superb volley from the edge of the box nine minutes later.

Shami Chakrabarti's inquiry reported in June that the party was not "overrun" by anti-Semitism. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said her report's credibility "lies in tatters" after she accepted the peerage. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn praised her "legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained." Ms Chakrabarti said she was "honoured to accept Jeremy Corbyn's challenge". The former director of civil liberties group Liberty said it was an "opportunity to help hold the government to account". She also said: "This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime." Who is Shami Chakrabarti She was the Labour leader's only nomination as part of David Cameron's resignation honours list. Ms Chakrabarti was appointed to lead an independent inquiry into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. The review found there was evidence of "ignorant attitudes" but said the "Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism". In a statement posted on Twitter, the Chief Rabbi said: "Shami Chakrabarti has a proud record of public service, but in accepting this peerage, the credibility of her report lies in tatters and the Labour Party's stated intention, to unequivocally tackle anti-Semitism, remains woefully unrealised." Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: "Shami Chakrabarti will bring great experience to Lords. But let's not pretend that a Labour peerage in these circumstances doesn't stink." Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said it was "beyond disappointing" that she had been offered a peerage by Labour "following her so-called independent inquiry". And a statement from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: "If anybody still took Shami Chakrabarti's report on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn's declared opposition to anti-Semitism seriously, this must be the final straw... "Having promised to never send anyone to the House of Lords, that is exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has done in return for a clean bill of health." But a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: "Shami Chakrabarti shares Jeremy's ambition for reform of the House of Lords. "Her career has been one of public service and human rights advocacy. "Her legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained from many ordinary Britons, will be a considerable asset to the House of Lords. "Brexit will put many hard-fought rights at risk, so it is crucial that those equipped with the right skills are given the opportunity to hold this government to account." Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson had called on the party to boycott the honours process amid criticism of David Cameron's use of his resignation list to recognise former Downing Street staff, Conservative donors and Remain campaign officials. Before the official list was published on Thursday, Mr Watson told the Evening Standard: "Labour cannot legitimise this process by co-operating. Labour requires working peers, as do the other opposition parties, but we cannot allow an outrageous abuse of a prime minister's discretionary power to go unchallenged." Several Conservative MPs have expressed reservations about some of the 46 names on the list - which were all approved by a committee independent of government. Tim Loughton tweeted: "To have your resignation honours list leaked is unfortunate. "To go ahead with it after such a public outcry about cronyism, chumocracy and bringing whole honours system into disrepute stinks, not least for those on list who actually deserve to be and previous worthy recipients." But a former leader of the House of Lords has defended the decision to also create 13 new Conservative peers, saying an unprecedented number of Conservative members of the unelected chamber had retired since 2010, including 13 in the past year. "150 peers departed since 2010 (43 Tories). Highest rate of exits since hereditary 'cull' because possible for peers to retire," Baroness Stowell tweeted. She added: "It is a privileged opportunity to do, not a reward for having done. Look forward to welcoming new colleagues". The new appointments mean the Conservatives will have one more life peer than Labour - 207 to 206 - but are still well short of an overall majority, partly due to the large number of crossbench members.	Jewish community leaders have criticised Jeremy Corbyn's decision to nominate the head of Labour's anti-Semitism inquiry for a peerage.
"The truth is that Taylor Swift and I are together, and we're very happy," the actor told the Hollywood Reporter. "That's the truth," he continued. "It's not a publicity stunt." Hiddleston has been speaking about his first Emmy nomination for The Night Manager, saying it was "fantastic" to to be up for outstanding lead actor. Hiddleston played concierge-turned-spy Jonathan Pine in the BBC's adaptation of John le Carre's novel. He was nominated on Thursday for the prize for lead actor in a miniseries or movie, alongside fellow Brits Benedict Cumberbatch and Idris Elba, and US stars Bryan Cranston, Cuba Gooding Jr and Courtney B Vance. But it is speculation about his relationship with Swift that has been rife in the press since they were snapped embracing near Swift's home in Rhode Island last month. The images went viral online. Hiddleston, 35, who is in Australia shooting reprising his Loki role in the latest Thor film, had previously refused to discuss the relationship with the press. There had been reports that they could have been filming a music video together. "I'd rather just talk about my work if that's all right," he told one reporter in Queensland earlier this week. But when asked by the Hollywood Reporter how he would "respond to people who claim that you're involved in some sort of publicity stunt", the British actor rejected the "notion". The magazine reported that he laughed at the question and thanked them for asking it. Swift was previously in a relationship with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, who 'unfollowed' her on Twitter after images of the singer kissing Hiddleston appeared online.

I will be taking a week off and then focusing on South Africa's general election before returning to the hard benches of Courtroom GD on 5 May.

The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up. Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010. The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew. The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence. "It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege," said Ainslie. Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history. "To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb," Ainslie added. "We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that. "The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. " The New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect. Media playback is not supported on this device But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the "Auld Mug". The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed. In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg. After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed "What a race," said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. "It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart. "On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day." Barker, 41, said: "It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal. "I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand." As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup. The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling. Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition. They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph. Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers. But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors. Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus. Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle. Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final. But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.	Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.
His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: "I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one." On bird flu: "I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama." On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine." Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: "Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem." On being sacked: "If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later." On Chelsea's pitch: "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed." On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: "If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message," Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: "If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood." Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: "My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: "When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer." Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: "I find Jose's 'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. "It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation." Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: "Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him." Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: "It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football." February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined £8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an "enemy of football" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined £5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of "fault and fault and cheat and cheat" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined £200,000, which is reduced to £75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee. He was jeered by sections of the Real support during his final game in charge against Osasuna.	Jose Mourinho is back as manager of Chelsea after leaving Stamford Bridge in September 2007.
They say the lengths of tiny pieces of DNA called telomeres indicate whether a young creature is likely to live long into old age. But before you rush out to get your telomeres stretched - were such a process possible - it is worth pointing out that the creatures they have been working with are not humans but altogether shorter-lived zebra finches. Everything that is made up of living cells contains chromosomes: the genetic code that makes us what we are. At the ends of each chromosome lie the telomeres. They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling. Over time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die. This is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life? To find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team. Tiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes. To find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.  But the last hardy specimen kept them waiting almost nine years. In every case the longest lived birds had the longest telomeres, but the best predictor of lifespan was the length of the telomeres at just 25 days old. Prof Monaghan says the study shows the importance of processes acting early in life. The next step will be to find out why the length of telomeres can vary so much from individual to individual. "We now need to know more about how early life conditions can influence the pattern of telomere loss and the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors," she said. The results of the research have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. They are certain to raise the question of whether our telomeres are similar predictors of how long we will live. But it is a big leap from the laboratory to the real world - whatever our telomeres may say, human lifespans also have to contend with additional factors like diet, drink and stress. Wild finches, meanwhile, have snakes and birds of prey to worry about. The bottom line for now?  Ask not for whom the zebra finch chirps...	Scientists at Glasgow University say they have found a key genetic indicator of how long an individual will live.
Bill Palmer, from Southampton, called the Alex Dyke show on BBC Radio Solent about his life after his wife went into a nursing home. Dyke immediately ordered a taxi to bring Mr Palmer to the studio to allow phone-in listeners to chat to him. A recording of the call has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The 95-year-old, from Sholing, married his wife Sheila, 85, on 2 June 2014 after they had been friends for 30 years. Shortly afterwards Sheila - who has dementia and colitis - fell and was taken into hospital. She was then moved into a nursing home, where she now lives. Mr Palmer phoned the BBC Radio Solent programme on Wednesday during a phone-in on "Love - later in life". Although he visits his wife every day, he said: "Every day is hell. I feel so alone". The production team immediately arranged to take Mr Palmer to the studio in Southampton, where he sat in on the rest of the show. Mr Palmer said: "I just sit with my wife and we tell each other we love each other, and that's it. "She knows who I am and she often says 'we did get married on the second of June didn't we?' - and that's when it hurts. "I listen to the radio and watch TV and have lots of friends, but unfortunately when you get old people don't visit - that's life." Listeners phoned in to offer support and advice to Mr Palmer. He was offered Sunday lunch, afternoon trips out and a ukulele orchestra to play for him, but he kindly turned them all down. "I didn't know such kindness existed," he told one caller. Dyke said Mr Palmer had "touched the hearts of thousands of listeners" and it was his "nicest moment in 30 years of broadcasting".	A 95-year-old invited into a BBC radio programme after calling in about being lonely has become a hit on social media.
Connor Williams, 17, and Conor Tiley, 18, both from Aberbargoed, died in a crash on New Road, Tir-y-Berth, Hengoed, on 3 January. The teenager was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Gwent Police confirmed no further action would be taken.	A 17-year-old boy arrested following a crash which killed two teenagers in Caerphilly county has been released without charge.
Around 200 people are feared to have drowned as they tried to cross from Zuwara, west of Tripoli, to Italy. Police in Italy have detained 10 suspected traffickers after 52 people were found dead in the hold of a ship off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. President Obama's spokesman said the migrant crisis showed that unrest in the Middle East had a worldwide impact. Josh Earnest said Europe should get tougher on traffickers who were exploiting migrants. On Friday workers from the Libyan Red Crescent were undertaking the grim task of recovering migrants' bodies which had washed up on the coast. "We, the Red Crescent, work with nothing. Some fishermen help us with a boat," Ibrahim al-Attoushi from the Red Crescent in Zuwara told Reuters. "We only have one ambulance car." Around 100 bodies have already been found, and the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) said a further 100 people are unaccounted for. Some of those who died were trapped in the hull of one of the boats. The Libyan coast-guard had worked overnight on Thursday, searching for survivors from the two boats. At least 150 survivors of the sinkings have been taken to a refugee centre and a detention centre in Libya. Ayman Talaal, a Syrian survivor, said he and his family had been "forced into this route". "It's called the route of death. It is now called the grave of the Mediterranean sea," he said. While most of the victims of Thursday's capsizes are thought to be from Syria and African countries, a Bangladeshi diplomat told the BBC that at least five Bangladeshi nationals, including a six-month-old baby, were among the dead. Some survivors were rescued having spent the night in the water, clinging to life jackets. Meanwhile officials in Palermo investigating the deaths of 52 migrants found dead in a boat's hold on Wednesday have detained 10 of the 571 survivors brought ashore, on suspicion of murder, Rai TV reports. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia told AP that those detained included seven Moroccans, two Syrians and a Libyan. A Swedish coastguard ship, the Poseidon, working with the EU's Frontex border agency, brought the survivors and the bodies to the Sicilian port. Thousands of people set off from lawless Libya every night, packed into boats, trying to reach safety in Europe. Many of the vessels are not seaworthy and are overcrowded. Since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos, with various militias fighting for power. The internationally-recognised government has been forced to leave Tripoli and does not control the country's western coast, from where most migrant boats depart, aiming for Italy. The UNHCR says more than 2,500 people have died trying to reach Europe so far in 2015, not including Thursday's deaths. Meanwhile Austrian police have confirmed that 71 people died inside a refrigerated lorry found abandoned on a motorway near the Hungarian border. They think that at least some of the dead were from Syria. "If we had an orderly safe way for people to come to Europe then we would avoid these tragedies," the UNHCR's William Spindler told the BBC. "We would also have less incentives for illegal immigration because we would have legal avenues to come, so people would not have to risk their lives in this way".	Libyan workers continue to search for bodies at sea and on shore after two migrant vessels capsized on Thursday.
Stead curled home with 14 minutes remaining to cap a fine comeback at the Northern Gas and Power Stadium after Louis Lang cancelled out Toto Nsiala's opener. Hartlepool flew out of the blocks and took an eighth-minute lead when Nsiala bundled home at the back post after Lewis Alessandra beat his man and sent in a pin-point cross. There was plenty more action in an entertaining opening period, Stead and Matthew Bates hitting the woodwork at either end. The former struck the post again early in the second half, before Lang capitalised on Pools' defence switching off by slotting a deserved equaliser into an empty net. Stead would eventually produce the decisive moment, turning coolly in the area and sending a left-footed strike beyond Trevor Carson. Pools pressed for a leveller to preserve an unbeaten league start, but their efforts proved in vain as the Magpies collected a first win of the campaign. Report supplied by Press Association.

After 11 hours of secret discussions, the musicians could not reach a decision on a replacement for Sir Simon Rattle, who steps down in 2018. Board member Peter Riegelbauer said they would try again "within a year". The orchestra's 123 members met in a south-west Berlin church on Monday and were banned from using mobile phones. But after an announcement was delayed several times, Mr Riegelbauer said: "I must unfortunately tell you that we haven't reached any result." From September 2017, Sir Simon is to join the London Symphony Orchestra as its music director. Among his possible successors are: The Berlin Philharmonic, founded in 1882, has had three chief conductors over the past six decades:	Members of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra have been unable to agree on who should be their next chief conductor and artistic director.
The 80 signatories include leading figures in the Asian hospitality industry and award-winning gospel singer Rachel Kerr. The PM is expected to recommend Britain remains in a reformed EU. Remain campaigners said several Commonwealth leaders, including India's PM, had urged Britain to stay in. The 80 figures from Britain's Commonwealth community criticised Mr Cameron for a lack of ambition in his EU reform demands, which he hopes to put to the public in a referendum in June. They claimed the UK government's immigration policy discriminates against non-EU citizens. In their letter to Mr Cameron, published by the Vote Leave campaign, they say: "As patriotic Britons of Commonwealth backgrounds, we saw the EU renegotiation as an opportunity to rediscover Britain's global vocation. "As long as Britain's trade policy is controlled by the EU, we cannot sign bilateral free trade agreements with Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand or for that matter any other non-EU state. "Vested interests on the Continent sustain a relatively protectionist policy. We have to apply the EU's common external tariff to exports from Commonwealth countries - hurting consumers here as well as producers there. "At the same time, our immigration policy forces us, in effect, to turn away qualified workers from the Commonwealth so as to free up unlimited space for migrants from the EU. "The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom." One of the signatories, Pasha Khandaker, president of the UK Bangladesh Caterers Association UK, said the 12,000 curry houses his organisation represents "have been struggling to recruit the talent that they need because of the difficulties associated with employing people from outside of the EU". "If the UK had a fairer immigration system it would be easier for businesses to recruit skilled workers regardless of their nationality," he added. Other signatories include Rachel Kerr, who won a Mobo award in 2012, in the gospel music category, and Moni Verma, founder of Veetee Rice, a UK-based food business with a turnover of Â£80m a year. A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: "Several Commonwealth leaders have been very clear that Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe. "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Britain is the entry point for trade right across Europe; while Australia's former deputy prime minister said the Commonwealth could never replace the trade Britain does with the EU. "We get the best of both worlds in Europe, trading freely with the world's largest market, as well as accessing free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe. "While Leave campaigners may look back with rose-tinted spectacles, they have no plan for what Britain outside the EU would look like, and no guarantee that trade, jobs and prices wouldn't be hit." In a separate development, 63% of business people polled by the British Chambers of Commerce said David Cameron's EU negotiations would not change the way they will vote in the referendum. The internet survey of 2,133 BCC members found 60% would vote to remain, down slightly from 63% in a previous poll in September, with 30% saying they would vote to leave, a 3% increase. Those representing large firms were significantly more likely to vote 'remain' than small-business people. BCC director general John Longworth said: "Our findings suggest that for business people, this is a question of in or out - not renegotiation."	Community and business leaders with Commonwealth links have written to David Cameron to urge him to back Britain's exit from the EU.
This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a "Facebook revolution". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people. Twitter: Nawara Negm I'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square. The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger. In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution. Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic) The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far. To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard. After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died. Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: "We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years." People have called this the "Facebook Revolution" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked. In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to. We're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.	Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.
A message on Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz's Twitter feed claimed Hitler was the "greatest man in history". Another tweet on Ms Gurbaz's account suggested Iran could develop a nuclear weapon to "wipe Israel off the map". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said anyone who makes anti-Semitic remarks is "auto-excluded from the party" pending an inquiry. The BBC has contacted the councillor for comment. The Labour Party has confirmed she has been suspended pending an investigation. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn said: "Anti-Semitism is absolutely abhorrent and wrong. "We have suspended, we will suspend, any member that behaves in that way." The tweets in question were made before Ms Gurbuz was elected to Luton Borough Council in May 2015. A spokesman for the council said: "While these comments appear to pre-date her time as a councillor, the council is shocked by these comments. "This matter will be referred as a matter of urgency to the council's independent standards committee to allow a full investigation to take place." On Thursday, Mr Corbyn was criticised by a Jewish leader for not taking anti-Semitism seriously enough.	A Labour councillor has been suspended from the party over anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account.
The German shepherd, which belonged to Cleveland Police, was being exercised near to Ormseby Stables in Eston when it bit a 28-year-old man. The man suffered puncture wounds on his arm and upper body and was taken to hospital. The dog handler also suffered an injury to his arm. The force has apologised and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A police spokesman said: "Based on an assessment of the animal it has been put to sleep. "This was not an easy decision for any of the people involved, but has been made in the best interests of all those involved." The incident occurred on 6 June. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ciaron Irvine said it would be "wrong to speculate" until the full circumstances were known. "What is clear is that this incident should not have happened and we must absolutely understand what went wrong," he added.	A police dog has been put down after biting a member of the public.
Kengo Kuma was given a tour of the site where construction of the museum's curved inner walls is underway. The architect said he was confident the museum would be completed on schedule at the end of 2017 and open in the summer of the following year. It will take the remainder of 2016 to take the building up to roof height. Mr Kuma said:  I am very happy to see the progress of the construction. "The level of construction is very high and beautiful - it is not an easy construction because the detail is unique. "I can feel the scale of the spaces and the scale is as I expected." Key milestones in the first year of work included the completion of a coffer dam which enabled construction of part of the building that will sit out over the River Tay. This year's programme involves construction of the core inner walls, stairwell and lift cores and the outer double curvature walls of the building. Representatives from Dundee City Council and BAM Construction Ltd accompanied Kengo Kuma on the tour of the site. Dundee Lord Provost Bob Duncan said: "People can see from the outside that something really special is beginning to take shape on this site. "I am delighted that Kengo Kuma can see how much has been achieved here in the space of a year. "We are delighted with the attention that this project is focusing on our city." Pre-cast panels will be installed in 2017 to the exterior to give the building its unique slatted, multi-layered appearance. BAM's construction manager Malcolm Boyd said: "We are relishing meeting the unique technical and construction challenges and working with all our partners to deliver a building that will inspire Dundonians and attract worldwide recognition ."	The architect of Dundee's V&A museum said he was "very happy" with its progress one year after the £80.1m construction project began.
Their nationalities are not known. The incident occurred early on Wednesday in Helmand province. Soldiers returned fire killing the attackers, a coalition spokesperson said. There have been dozens of "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghan security personnel have targeted their Western allies since 2007. No group has said it carried out the latest attack. Insider attacks - on international and Afghan forces - have became one of the gravest security threats of the later phase of the conflict in Afghanistan, although the rate of such incidents has dropped in recent years. More than 100 foreign soldiers have been killed. Nato has adopted special security measures to offset the threat. The alliance ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December, withdrawing most of its troops apart from a 13,000-strong residual force used for training and counter-terrorism operations. One of the worst insider attacks took place last August when a US general was killed in an attack by an Afghan soldier at a British-run military academy near Kabul. US Major General Harold Greene was the most senior American military officer to die in action overseas since the Vietnam War. Many insider attacks are blamed on Taliban infiltration or arguments between foreign and local soldiers getting out of hand. In some cases such attacks are carried out by an individual - or individuals - acting on their own initiative rather than organised insurgency violence. The Taliban have stepped up their summer offensive despite an acrimonious leadership dispute following the death of their long-time leader Mullah Omar.	Two people in Afghan military uniforms opened fire on a vehicle killing two Nato soldiers at a military base in the south, alliance officials say.
Seventy staff at Ferguson Shipbuilder, Port Glasgow, were laid off last August when it went into administration. Entrepreneur Jim McColl, who took over the business, said it now employed 140 staff - and he hoped for a near 10-fold increase in that number by 2020. He plans to invest up to Â£65m in the yard, which was the last in Britain fully equipped to build merchant ships. The firm, renamed Ferguson Marine, is currently building a hybrid electric/diesel ferry for Caledonian MacBrayne. A bid has also been lodged to build two large Hebridean ferries, with an announcement due soon. At the same time, much of the yard is being demolished as part of a Â£12m rebuild. Mr McColl, who made his fortune building up the engineering firm Clyde Blowers, said he was attracted to Fergusons for "sentimental reasons" but there were also sound business opportunities underpinning the buyout. "We look at the market they're in and try to assess the demand for the kind of products that they do," he said. "We saw a huge demand. Most people who are looking for boats of any kind in the UK have to go overseas for it. Many of them don't want to. "They want the work done here. They want repairs and upgrades done here but the facilities aren't there any more. "Most of the yards around the UK have been turned into executive apartments and wine bars alongside the river side." He said part of the deal in re-employing the laid-off workers was that they would need to work flexibly. They also received a 5% pay rise. Mr McColl is looking at the market for refitting luxury yachts for the "super rich". He is also working with a Formula 1 team, trying to get better performance out of marine batteries. "We've got a five-year plan. One scenario which is an optimistic one, we could have 1,300 employees here. That's ten times what we have got just now. "There's a fairly buoyant market for the kind of work we're looking to do. There are very few facilities in the UK that can do it. "By May next year we will have a completely new fabrication facility and shipyard here and by August next year we'll have the new office up as well. "So in a year's time this will be a 21st Century shipyard that's very efficient, able to compete with anywhere in the world."	Plans are being developed to employ up to 1,300 workers at a Clyde shipyard which went bust a year ago.
John Porter's brother Mike, 66, died at the scene after the men were knocked to the ground by cows in Wiltshire. After an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death, he said he hoped more could be done to prevent a further tragedy. The jury noted that there had been previous attacks in the same fields. And jurors noted a lack of separation between cattle and public, in a narrative accompanying their verdict. Mr Porter, 74, from Monkton Combe, near Bath, told the BBC: "Accidents will always happen, sadly. But I do think that we do need to look at ways in which we can make our footpaths safer." His brother was visiting from Edinburgh in May 2013 when they walked dogs on leads across a public footpath through Elbow Field, Turleigh. They were knocked to the ground by two cows and stamped on. Mike died at the scene of internal bleeding. The inquest heard that Simon Dark, Bleddyn Griffiths and David Billington had also suffered injuries after being trampled in the fields in 2008 and 2011 - although it was not possible to say whether the same cows were involved. The farmer Brian Godwin, 81, had been visited by the Health and Safety Executive after Mr Billington was injured. He had put in place some safety measures, including signs and some electric fencing. He has since sold the cattle and is trying to establish a new herd. The lawyers representing Mike Porter's partner Adrienne Sillar and their two sons said there was a "clear issue" about whether Elbow Field should remain a public right of way and "whether cows should share the enclosure".	A man who survived a cow trampling attack in which his brother was killed has told the BBC public footpaths need to be made safer.
As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room. Once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009. We had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain. But Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case. But put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin? At our first meeting - without a television camera  - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation. We challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an "audit" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin.  We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself. He talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the "lefty" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig "Satoshi"  just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel. What he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - "that would be telling" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a "nice big house and a nice fast car" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches. The second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better. At first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye. "I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone," he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff. It seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin. Throughout the demonstrations he showed us he kept on stressing the complexity of the process - "obviously everyone said I have no idea about this stuff so I'm going to do it in the most convoluted way possible". We were then supplied with a series of documents providing evidence that Dr Craig Stephen Wright was a Master of Statistics, IT Management, and Law, and a long list of peer-reviewed articles. Now he says he intends to continue his research into improving the technology behind Bitcoin, and plans to publish several papers over the coming months. With the community around the currency in some turmoil right now over how it develops, you might think that Craig Wright could provide some leadership. After all, he could be said to be to Bitcoin what Tim Berners-Lee is to the web. But he bridled at my suggestion that he could be a figurehead for the currency, making clear that this was the first and last television interview he would do. Having emerged from the shadows, Craig Satoshi Wright now wants to return to them as quickly as possible.	It was in a conference room above a coffee shop a fifteen minute walk from BBC Broadcasting House that we first met the man who says he is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
It had aimed to raise £10m of investments in the club from small-scale retail buyers of shares. There was already a commitment to the major part of the share offer, with rich individuals and institutional investors signing up to at least £17m. The club announced on Tuesday evening that it had raised a total of £22.2m. On Wednesday morning, the shares in Rangers International Football Club plc will start trading on London's Alternative Investments Market (AIM). It is part of the London Stock Exchange, on which shares in Celtic Football Club are also traded. The deadline for fans to buy new shares in the club passed on Tuesday afternoon. A statement from Rangers said: "A total of £22.2 million has been raised from professional and institutional investors and supporters which will be used to take the club forward, strengthen the squad when appropriate and improve facilities." Chief executive Charles Green said: "This is an exciting time for everyone associated with this 140-year-old institution but we are just at the start of the journey. "We are rebuilding and Rangers will rise again and we will do so with the help of our fans and the institutional investors who are on board." Mr Green was listed as the club's main shareholder in the share prospectus with a stake of almost 15%, which will now be diluted. He had not planned to add to his shares. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was the third largest shareholder with 9% before the issue of extra shares, behind a consortium called Blue Pitch Holdings. Meanwhile, Green took to the Ibrox pitch to address the crowd ahead of the 3-0 win over Annan Athletic to announce how much been raised through a share issue. However, while his speech was taking place, a section of the support staged a protest against potential plans to sell the stadium naming rights. After his side's 3-0 win, Rangers manager Ally McCoist described it as "a great day off the park". "The fact that it's in the region of £22m, and for the fans to chip in with roughly £5m, I think is absolutely staggering," he said. "They've only had the opportunity to do that in the last week or so. "In the lead-up to Christmas, when finances are tight at the best of times, in a recession, for our supporters to go into their pockets and come up with that money is another incredible show of support for this football club. "I think the best way I can put it is, the one thing the investors and, certainly, the fans deserve is for their money to be used wisely. "And I would certainly hope to have an opportunity to use some of that money wisely."	Rangers Football Club has raised half its target investment from fans, following the deadline for its share offer.
It features the vast Cuajone copper mine in the Andes, where some 170,000 tonnes of metal are taken from the ground each year. Built by Europe's Airbus group and launched on 16 September, PerúSAT-1 can see features as small as 70cm. Its pictures will have myriad uses - from agriculture and urban planning to border control and disaster relief. The satellite is being operated by the Peruvian space agency, CONIDA, at a height of 695km.	Peru's first national satellite, PerúSAT-1, has returned its maiden image of the country.
It has been a great experience for me to be involved with Melbourne and winning the Australian Women's Grand Final against Perth Glory is another career highlight. We made history by being the first team to retain their title and that is phenomenal. To fly away from home and win it 2-0 truly was one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. The big difference for me this year is being involved as a player-manager, rather than just a midfielder. Is it a hard adjustment to make? Absolutely. It's very hard to deal with. It's very mentally and physically draining, but it's equally very rewarding in different ways. When the final whistle went at the weekend it made every second of the season worthwhile. The juice was definitely worth the squeeze. Being a manager is a very difficult thing to do and you have to have a very good group of players and coaches for it to work. Thankfully and luckily we did have that. I have thought about getting into coaching, but the way this came about was more to do with circumstances than anything else. Our head coach (Jo Montemurro) went into our men's side as an assistant and I stepped up. It was a natural thing, really. We were so far into the season that it was probably going to be the least disruptive for everyone involved. I didn't think twice about it when the (Melbourne) City group asked me to do the job. Equally I knew that it would be OK with the group that we had, because we have a very, very good group of girls. For me, at the stage of my career, this is the best of both worlds. I want to learn how to coach and how to develop as a coach and I believe I'm in the best place for that. But I'm not anywhere near retiring right now so I'm still playing and loving my football. I believe coaching educates me as a player as much as me learning as a coach pushes me out of my comfort zone. After an absolutely amazing experience in Melbourne, I head home soon to meet up with Wales ahead of the Cyprus Cup. I'm going to stay with Wales for another campaign after briefly considering international retirement and am really excited to get back to prepare for our World Cup campaign that will start later this year. My experiences with Melbourne can stand me in really good stead for Wales and my American club side Seattle Reign. I just go as a player to those camps, but I do have experience in leading groups and being a good person who helps when they're in a bit of trouble or being successful. The experience of this whole campaign I've just had with City is probably one of a kind. I certainly want to continue in football beyond playing, but who knows if the opportunity will ever be there to coach in the men's game. I think it'll be a lot easier for women to go into the male game in the future, in the right environment, as I had in Melbourne. At Melbourne, everyone believes in and supports each other and the crossover between male and female is very similar and even. In that environment I can't see it being a problem. But that environment is not replicated all over the world. Some clubs would be very receptive to a female coach, other clubs less so. But luckily, that is not something I have to worry about for a good few years yet!	I have certainly had worse 24 hours in my life than winning the Grand Final with Melbourne City and then being named in the Wales squad for the Cyprus Cup.
His comments come amid the expenses scandal that has embroiled the government for the past three weeks. Mr Abbott said on Friday the woman at the centre of the scandal, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop, was "deeply remorseful" about her use of taxpayers' funds to travel to friends' weddings and Liberal party functions. The prime minister has himself had to pay back money spent on travel in the past. The scandal began when it became public that Ms Bishop had spent A$5,000 ($3,647; Â£2,339) of public funds on a helicopter flight to a Liberal Party function that could have easily been reached by road. She has also claimed expenses for travel to several weddings of her Liberal Party colleagues. Australia's rules about travel entitlements for politicians are hazy but Ms Bishop's spending set social media on fire and she soon became the speaker who sparked a thousand memes. The Facebook page Bronwyn Bishop Memes gained more than 13,000 followers in just a week, as users poked fun at her chopper ride. Memes have adopted the helicopter as their main tool to mock the speaker, with Ms Bishop using chopper flights for everything from taking extreme holidays and dropping the kids at the local swimming pool to going for a jog - via chopper. The public have also had fun at her expense with cultural references ranging from Australian TV soap operas to movies such as 101 Dalmatians and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Social media taunts even included sly hints towards other expenses scandals, such as the misuse of living away from home allowances for politicians. Ms Bishop has apologised and is paying back the helicopter costs but she is resisting calls, from independent senators and reportedly even from some members of the government, to resign. "I love this country very much and it does sadden me that I have let [the public] down," Ms Bishop told reporters. "I won't resign from the position but I will be working very hard," she said.	Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reminded Australian politicians they cannot "get away with exploiting the rules" on expenses.
Notts slumped to 73-7 before Luke Wood (65 not out) Steven Mullaney (63) shared an eighth-wicket stand of 92. Onions took 5-56 as the hosts were dismissed for 204 in 54 overs, which meant Yorkshire were crowned county champions for the second year in a row. Durham closed 30 runs behind on 174-2, with Mark Stoneman making 62 and Scott Borthwick unbeaten on 56 The visitors won the toss and invited Notts to bat on an overcast day and Jake Libby, playing in his first game of the season after recovering from a cruciate ligament injury, fell to Chris Rushworth (2-15) in the first over for a second-ball duck. Onions got rid of Brendan Taylor and Michael Lumb, both for one, with the hosts slipping to 7-3 in the sixth over and Riki Wessels (13) then became a first wicket for 22-year-old Durham debutant Barry McCarthy (2-51). McCarthy dropped Mullaney, who was on 41 at the time, in the deep, but later trapped the former Lancashire player leg before. Wickets continued to fall and it was only the partnership of Mullaney and Wood - who passed fifty for the third time this season - which pushed Notts past 200 and earned a single batting bonus point. Durham started at pace in their reply with Stoneman and Jack Burnham putting on 78 for the first wicket in 15.5 overs. Stoneman, who was caught by Mullaney off Jake Ball, and Borthwick, who reached his ninth half-century of the season, then put on a second-wicket partnership of 53 as the hosts reached the close in a strong position. It meant Notts wicketkeeper Chris Read still requires two dismissals to become the 26th player in history to reach 1,000.	Graham Onions claimed a five-wicket haul to help Durham have the better of day one against Nottinghamshire.
The 22-year-old Australian will act as cover at Allianz Park during the Rugby World Cup, which takes place between 18 September and 31 October. Sarries could potentially lose Jamie George and Schalk Brits to England and South Africa duty at the tournament. "We felt we that we needed some more depth in the hooking position," Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall said. "Alongside Scott Spurling and Jared Saunders, Dave will provide us with more options. "He has been training with us since we've returned to pre-season and has fitted into the club very well." Porecki has had a spell with Super Rugby outfit Waratahs and has been playing for Sydney side Manly Marlins. Saracens will begin the defence of their Premiership title at home to Sale Sharks on Saturday, 17 October.	Premiership champions Saracens have signed hooker Dave Porecki on a short-term contract.
The unmanned cargo ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday, but contact was lost with it soon afterwards. Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin. It cannot reach the ISS and is likely to break up on re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The craft carried on to a higher orbit after contact was lost. Igor Komarov, the head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said: "The craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible." Two astronauts spending a year on the ISS, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, told the Associated Press news agency that flight controllers had given up hope of controlling Progress again. Progress is likely to re-enter Earth's atmosphere some time between 5 and 7 May. Other capsules - including one Progress craft last year - have burned up and disintegrated on re-entering Earth's atmosphere without posing a threat to the planet's population. Cathleen Lewis, a specialist in Russian space programmes at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said it was not yet known where debris will fall - but that it was highly unlikely to hit urban areas. "I always remind people that two-thirds of Earth's surface is water," she said. "The likelihood of it coming down and hitting someone is so remote as to be minuscule." The problem with the loss of the Progress is that it puts further pressure on the volume of stores held on the space station. ISS managers like to keep a good six months' supply of food, water, fuel and other resources in reserve at all times. Currently, however, this volume is somewhat depleted - in part because of the explosion on launch last year of the American Cygnus freighter. The responsibility for keeping the stores topped up leans heavily on Progress and the second American freighter, Dragon. The latter is due to make its next supply run in June. As long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned. If, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved. Progress was to deliver food, water, fuel, oxygen and clothing to the crew of six people on the space station that orbits about 420km (250 miles) above Earth. Even after Progress' loss, the astronauts have enough supplies to keep them going until the next expected delivery on 19 June. A Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters that the loss was valued at 2.59 billion roubles ($50.7m, Â£32.9m).	A Russian spacecraft delivering supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) is out of control and will fall back to Earth, officials say.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.	The party of Nigeria's incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party's dominance.
Hatton made eight birdies and three bogeys in his five-under-par 67, while Fitzpatrick carded a level-par 72. They are tied with Australia's Marc Leishman (71) at Bay Hill, three shots behind American leaders Charlie Hoffman (71) and Kevin Kisner (68). Rory McIlroy moved up to a tie for eighth after a seven-under-par 65. World number three McIlroy scored the joint-lowest round of the day, along with American Rickie Fowler - who moved into a tie for 11th. The 27-year-old Northern Irishman started the round 11 shots behind overnight leader Hoffman, but five birdies on the back nine moved him up the leaderboard. "I just played better, held some putts, which was nice to see. I just had to put it all together and I did," McIlroy told the PGA Tour. "Hopefully I can be in with a shout and then if I get off to a fast start tomorrow, I can be right in there."	England's Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick are both three shots off the lead going into the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Camden Glass, part of the Camden Group, has started a 30-day consultation with staff on the closure of its factory in Benburb, according to Unite. The firm produces and supplies PVCu window and door products. Camden Group has told Unite it will be creating 50 new jobs at a new plant in Antrim. Unite's representative Joanne McWilliams said Camden Group's investment in the Antrim plant was "cold comfort to the workforce in Benburb". "Many workers in Benburb have longstanding service at the plant - one of our members has worked there for 43 years," she said. "Many of the workers facing redundancy have built the company's success long before the current management took over. "To compound [the] decision, management have offered the workforce only the bare minimum, statutory redundancy. "Camden Group must live up to their social responsibilities and fully compensate their workforce for a decision driven by corporate priorities."	Sixty-five workers at a County Tyrone manufacturing company are set to lose their jobs, a trade union has said.
Groups who use the hall in Llanwinio said they would hand in their keys after the rent tripled and they were asked to sign up to a 25-year lease. Peter Walton, from the association that runs the hall, described the changes as "unreasonable and unfair". But the Diocese of St Davids said as a charity it was "obliged by law" to charge market-value rent. Rent costs charged to the Community Association of Volunteers are set to increase from £250 to £750 a year and it will also have to meet the costs of the insurance for the first time. The St Davids Diocesan Board of Finance (DBF) said: "A proper valuation of [the rental value] was undertaken and the rental charge increased in line with that. "The rental goes to the parish, not the DBF, hence keeping it within the local community." But Mr Walton from the Community Association of Volunteers told Newyddion 9 the finance board was behaving in an "unfair, unreasonable and unjust manner". He added: "It's not just the money... we will be taking all of our belongings out of this building on Saturday 27 February and we'll be handing the keys back unless there's a change of heart."	A row has broken out between community groups and a Carmarthenshire diocese over the cost of using a church hall.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told a BBC Radio Wales election phone-in he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests, but still wanted him to become prime minister. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not," he said. "The alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want." Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Gething rejected listeners' suggestions that Welsh Labour was failing to support the party's UK leader. "I want a Labour prime minister - and that means Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister," he said. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not - it matters whether I think he can do the job in running the country. "It matters whether I think this country will be better off having a Labour prime minister than a Tory." Mr Gething admitted he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two Labour leadership contests, but accepted the party had voted "decisively" for him to be its leader and candidate for prime minister. He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs "being returned from Wales in large numbers". "We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales," he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. "I don't think we will be wiped out here," he said. "We've got a good record in government ... we're directly engaged in our local communities," he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was "appalled" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the "triple lock" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a "more open relationship" with the EU than a "hard" Brexit, calling for "full and unfettered" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was "economically beneficial". "There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment," he said. "I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: "A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves."	Labour figures in Wales are not trying to distance themselves from party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Welsh Government minister has insisted.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
The decision to call off the match was taken at 12:35 GMT following an inspection at Sportsdirect.com Park where part of the League One club's pitch was still frozen. The Latics are 22nd in the table and in the relegation places with Posh in sixth place. There has been no announcement as to when the fixture will be rearranged.	Oldham Athletic's League One fixture against Peterborough United has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.
Rory Gallagher's side have recovered from the disappointment of their heavy Ulster semi-final defeat to Tyrone with narrow wins over Longford and Meath. Galway enter into Round 4A of the qualifier series after surrendering their Connacht title to Roscommon. Cian Mulligan is the only injury concern for Donegal with a quad strain. Following their nine point loss to Tyrone in the Ulster championship, Donegal returned to winning ways with a hard-fought victory over Longford and then came out on top of a thrilling shoot-out against Meath earlier this month. 2012 Footballer of the Year Karl Lacey will equal Christy Toye's record of 65 championship appearances for Donegal if he features on Saturday. Galway had a strong start to their season when they beat Kildare to finish top of Division Two of the National League and earned promotion to Division One for next season. Kevin McStay's side beat arch-rivals Mayo in their Connacht championship semi-final but they will be disappointed with the way they lost their provincial title after a heavy nine-point loss to Roscommon in the Connacht final.	Donegal are hoping the momentum they have gained through the qualifier series can carry them through to the All Ireland quarter-finals.
Barker, 33, who captained Derby under Clough, has not played competitively since dislocating his knee and rupturing ligaments in March 2012. He is set to start training with Burton after undergoing minor knee surgery. "If we have room budget-wise and he is OK, then it is a no-brainer for us," Clough said. "He is just a good post influence to have around with Championship experience. He is a good person to have around the football club. "His treatment is going well and he is close to joining back in, so he is one that we haven't ruled out at all." After taking nearly three years to recover from his horrific knee injury, Barker returned to play for Derby's under-21 side in February 2015, only to be released by the Rams later that year. He has since been granted a testimonial year by the Championship club and has repeatedly expressed a desire to return to play professionally. Clough says Barker is still capable of making an impact as a player. "You want him to contribute on the pitch, but he has a lot more to offer than just on the pitch," Clough said. "He wants to get out and play. There will be plenty of times this season with five or 10 minutes to go when we will need someone to come on and head the ball in our box. "I cant think anyone better than him."	Former Derby County defender Shaun Barker will be offered a deal at Burton Albion if he can prove his fitness, says manager Nigel Clough.
Darya Klishina, 25, initially escaped a blanket ban on Russia's athletes for doping by governing body the IAAF, but her eligibility was revoked following new, but unspecified, information. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has overturned that decision. Qualifying for the long jump takes place on Tuesday. "I can thankfully focus my time and attention on competing tomorrow night and enjoying my Olympic experience, which I have dreamed of since I first began long jumping as a young girl," said Klishina on Facebook. Russian track and field athletes were banned from the Olympics following claims the country ran a state-sponsored doping programme. Klishina, 10th in the 2015 World Championships, had been cleared to compete in her first Olympics as her drugs-testing record was established in the United States, where she is based, rather than in Russia. In upholding Klishina's appeal, Cas said that her permanent residence outside Russia still applied despite the IAAF's additional information. "We instigated a review process following new evidence presented to us," said the IAAF in response. "The outcome we reached to revoke Darya Klishina's exceptional eligibility was not upheld by Cas despite the information received and she is therefore eligible to compete in Rio."

The only Russian due to compete in the athletics at Rio 2016 has been cleared to contest the women's long jump after successfully appealing against a ban.
The 28 EU interior ministers will hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on 14 September. July was a record month, with more than 100,000 reaching the EU's borders. But it is proving difficult to get agreement on joint action, as migration pressure varies from country to country. What are the biggest obstacles to a solution? Free movement arguments The EU core principle of free movement - embodied in the passport-free Schengen area - is in dispute. UK Home Secretary Theresa May called the EU migration system "broken", saying the Schengen system had "exacerbated" the problem of large-scale irregular migration. The UK and Ireland are not in Schengen, but nearly all of their EU partners are, as well as some non-EU countries. Nationalists across Europe, such as the National Front (FN) in France and Italy's Northern League, also blame Schengen for the ease with which many migrants have travelled from southern to northern Europe. But the governments in France and Germany are among those who value Schengen for its contribution to the European economy. Schengen makes it easier for firms to hire workers from other EU countries, or to post workers abroad. The principle of free movement also has huge symbolic value for the EU. East Europeans embraced it eagerly after decades of communism, when travel to the West was impossible for most ordinary citizens. But Schengen members can re-impose border controls temporarily for national security reasons, for example if they face an extraordinary surge of migrants. There is pressure in the EU now to give authorities more discretion to do that. Why do Europe's political leaders seem unable to act? Arguments over barriers Hungary, which is in the Schengen zone, has built a 175km (110-mile) razor-wire fence 4m (13ft) high along its border with Serbia, which is outside the area. The barrier will be strengthened in the coming weeks, but it is highly controversial. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised it, in remarks rejected by the Hungarian government as "shocking and groundless". In the first quarter of 2015 Hungary became a new migration hotspot, as thousands of asylum seekers saw it as an easier gateway to northern Europe. Of the 32,810 asylum applicants in Hungary in that period 70% were from Kosovo. Most Kosovans are fleeing dire poverty, rather than political or religious persecution, so in most cases their asylum claims are rejected. But now, many of those reaching the fence have fled the war in Syria and have legitimate asylum claims. Trainloads of migrants are heading for Austria and Germany from Budapest - and Hungary's neighbours worry that it has merely shifted the problem on to them. Bulgaria - not in Schengen - has also put up a razor-wire fence on its border with Turkey, to keep migrants out. Spain's small territories of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa are similarly fenced off. The UK's investment in extra border security at Calais, in northern France, is less controversial, as the UK is not in Schengen and migrants have been risking their lives jumping on to lorries and trains. But it suggests a growing "fortress Europe" attitude in the EU, contradicting the liberal values on which the EU was founded. Many Europeans cherish their hard-won democratic freedoms, and oppose the creation of new border fences. Many also argue that, instead of erecting barriers, the EU should do more to tackle the people-traffickers who make huge profits from migrants' misery. Quota disagreements EU ministers have rejected binding quotas for the distribution of refugees, despite the difficulties faced by Greece, Italy and Hungary. They are the main entry points for migrants crossing the Mediterranean and the Balkans. The European Commission urged EU governments to accept a mandatory "distribution key" to resettle 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean refugees. Instead, they agreed to accept 32,500 on a voluntary basis. The UK has opted out of any quota system, amid a widespread hardening of attitudes towards immigration. There are tensions in the EU over the whole European asylum policy, because of the disproportionate burden faced by some countries. The EU is trying to adapt the rules to deal with the crisis, but politicians want to see rapid progress, not just long-term plans. The controversial Dublin Regulation is under review, and Germany has stopped abiding by it. Under Dublin, the EU country where an asylum seeker first arrives has a duty to process their claim. So if that migrant moves elsewhere in the EU he/she can be sent back to where they first arrived. Extra EU help has been promised for the countries most in need. Of the €2.4bn (£1.7bn; $2.7bn) approved for the next six years, Italy is to get nearly €560m and Greece €473m. The UK, France and Germany have called for migrants to be fingerprinted and registered when they arrive in Italy and Greece. But the migration hotspots need more EU help, as their reception centres are overcrowded. Burden-sharing is a divisive topic. Germany accepted by far the largest number of asylum claims last year and expects to see as many as 800,000 this year. Sweden had the second-highest number, yet it has a far smaller population than the UK, which accepted fewer asylum seekers. There are calls for eastern European countries to take in more asylum seekers. Slovakia argues that most migrants will still move to richer countries, where wages and welfare are better. Arguments over conflict zones Many Europeans are calling for much greater EU efforts to end the conflicts in Syria, Libya, the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan that are fuelling the exodus of refugees. The UK government is among those arguing that the EU aid budget can help stem the flow of poor and desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The UK says it is contributing generously to refugee welfare in countries bordering on Syria, which are housing far more Syrian refugees than the EU. Most refugees, it is argued, want to go home as soon as peace and stability are restored. And projects to ease poverty in sub-Saharan Africa can help to stem the considerable exodus from there. But critics of the UK stance say those are longer-term goals, whereas the crisis demands urgent action and co-operation among all 28 member states. Improving the economic prospects of young people in the Western Balkans - still recovering from war - could help stem the migrant surge from there. Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama says the EU should do much more to raise living standards in poor Balkan countries, which are negotiating to join the EU. Albania, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo are all experiencing an outflow of frustrated citizens seeking a better life in the EU. But EU countries cannot agree on the amount of aid those countries should get. There are fears that corruption could undermine aid projects - something that has bedevilled Kosovo. Nationalist arguments Nationalist parties and movements have played a big role in hardening attitudes towards immigration. Far-right Jobbik won 20% of the vote in Hungary's 2014 parliamentary elections, making it the most successful anti-immigration party in Europe. But even in the powerful, long-standing EU member states many mainstream politicians have taken a tough stance towards migrants. The UK Conservatives are urging new EU rules to limit migrants' access to welfare benefits. The UK Independence Party, demanding strict border controls and exit from the EU, also has a strong following. France's National Front has wooed many voters away from right and left. Meanwhile, ruling coalitions have done deals with the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) in the Netherlands and the Danish People's Party (DPP) in Denmark. In Finland, the nationalist Finns have entered government. In neighbouring Sweden, which has an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees, support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats has soared to almost 20%. Even in Germany - seen as profoundly loyal to EU values - nationalists and Eurosceptics have staged anti-immigrant marches, under the banner of Pegida, and have been elected to regional assemblies. Insecurity about migrants is widespread in a Europe blighted by unemployment and welfare cuts. So politicians are anxious not to appear "soft" on immigration. It means less hospitality towards migrants, even genuine refugees.	Europe is struggling with its biggest migration crisis since World War Two, with unprecedented numbers of refugees and other migrants seeking asylum in the EU.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
Davies, 26, followed up sealing her World Championship place in the 20km by setting two new British bests in the mile and 5km event. The Cardiff walker won the 5km at the British Championships in Birmingham. "It's been a very good week, all the hard work has paid off," said Davies. Davies competed in three events in seven days which began with achieving the London 2017 qualification time when she finished in a Welsh record 93:04 behind Gemma Bridge. Davies will be joined by Bridge and Tom Bosworth and Callum Wilkinson at the World Championships next month in London (August 4-13). "It is unbelievable," said Davies. "I probably when I was younger never expected to get to this level of sport. "It hasn't sunk in yet and when I get there I will probably have to take a few moments. "It's absolutely fantastic to be on the same stage as such big names. "This will be the biggest competition I have ever been to and it will be a big step up." Davies will now take part in a three-week altitude camp in Livigno, Italy and St. Moritz, Switzerland and attend a British Athletics holding camp in Paris before her event on 13 August on the Mall. Media playback is not supported on this device "It will mean so much because the first chance I saw race walking was at London 2012," said Davies. "To go from a spectator to the start line alongside the girls who have inspired me and are now my friends and rivals will be amazing. "It is going be a home event where all my friends and family will be watching. "Growing up, the thing I remember was watching the London Marathon finishing on the Mall. "To be there and doing my sport at the highest level is going to be amazing." Davies believes walking is receiving a higher public profile. "From when I started it (walking) has grown," said Davies. "We are getting more attention which has been helped by Tom Bosworth coming sixth in the Olympics last year which has raised the sport's profile. "Race walking is a really good way to get people drawn into athletics."	Welsh walker Bethan Davies says the hard work has paid off after qualifying for the World Championships in London and setting new three personal bests in a week.
Seamus McCollum, 56, died at Maine private nursing home in Randalstown in September of last year. However, the death was not treated as murder until April of this year, following the results of an autopsy. Mr McCollum had cerebral palsy and had lived at the care home for nine years. Police said the woman was being questioned at Antrim PSNI station.	A 61-year-old woman arrested by police investigating the murder of a man at a County Antrim nursing home has been released unconditionally.
Christian Englander will now face trial, with jury selection scheduled for 23 September, Assistant District Attorney Anastasia Martin said. Each charge carries a maximum jail term of six months and a possible $500 fine. Police said Englander had acknowledged throwing the peel after he was offended by jokes Chappelle made about a friend. "If I can, I would like to avoid a trial," Englander said on Monday, following a brief hearing before Judge Donita Sena in the magistrates' court. "I'm not afraid of the end result, but it's a waste of human resources." There are "real criminals out there that they can try. If there is a plea offering, I'll take it," Englander added. The case has attracted attention after Chappelle said throwing a banana peel was a racist act. On Monday, Englander, who is white, said that after the police apprehended him on 30 March, Chappelle came to the police station to speak to him. According to Englander, Chappelle asked him: "Don't you know bananas are racist?" Englander said he told Chappelle, 41, that he did not agree. Lieutenant Andrea Dobyns of the Santa Fe Police Department confirmed that Chappelle attended the police station that night to talk to Englander.	The man accused of throwing a banana peel at comedian Dave Chappelle during a New Mexico show has been charged with disturbing the peace and battery.
Defender Elphick, 28, first sustained the injury during the 4-3 win against West Ham in August. The former Brighton player last appeared for the Cherries in their 3-1 defeat at Norwich last month. "Tommy has had surgery on his ankle and could face 10 weeks out. It could be shorter," said manager Eddie Howe. Elphick was ever-present in the league last season as he captained the Cherries to the Championship title. Howe also confirmed striker Callum Wilson has had an operation after he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee against Stoke. Wilson, 23, faces up to six months out. Winger Ryan Fraser, currently on a season-long loan at Ipswich, will receive treatment at Bournemouth as he also recovers from medial ligament damage. The 21-year-old sustained the injury while training with Scotland Under-21s and is set to miss the next two months.	Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick has been ruled out until the new year following an operation on an ankle injury, the club has confirmed.
Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights. The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid. In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout. It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division. He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux. On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests. "This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight. "I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago. "Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me. "We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight. "I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion. "I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."	Carl Frampton's world featherweight title bout with defending champion Leo Santa Cruz will take place on 30 July in New York.
Over 100 shops in the coastal town of Cumana were hit and at least one person died according to local media. Venezuela has one of the world's highest inflation rates at 180% and people can queue for hours for subsidised food. Opposition politicians blame government mismanagement for the shortages. But the government says the shortages are part of an economic war being waged to drive President Nicolas Maduro from office. Most of the shops were looted for food according to opposition congresswoman Milagros Paz. She is quoted in Venezuelan newspaper El Universal as saying that the authorities "have not admitted the food distribution emergency". But according to the socialist governor of Sucre state, Luis Acuna, it was off licenses, opticians and clothes shops that were targeted in the looting, reports El Nacional. Food and medicine are in short supply and street protests have become increasingly agitated. More than 10 attempts of looting happen every day, according to the non-governmental organisation Venezuelan Violence Observatory. Diosdado Cabello, a lawmaker from Mr Maduro's PSUV party, blamed the opposition for inciting violent protest. "These are fascist groups which are generating unrest," he said. "Don't come to me with this fairy tale that these are spontaneous protests," he said on his television programme.	At least 400 people have been arrested in Venezuela after rioting and looting over food shortages.
Crews were called to the blaze at a building in Stewartville Street, in Partick, at about 12:15. The fire broke out in a communal area of the block. Four people were treated at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation. The blaze triggered a large response from the emergency services. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: "On arrival crews found a well-developed fire on the third floor of a six-storey residential block of flats with residents unable to leave the building. "Firefighters quickly brought the fire under control, whilst at the same time rescuing 17 people from the property, some of whom were suffering from slight smoke inhalation and minor injuries." Crews worked through the night to deal with any fire spread and make the scene safe. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "About 25 to 30 persons were evacuated." The Scottish Ambulance Service sent four resources from their special operations response team, two A&E ambulances and an ambulance car. A spokesman said: "We did not transport anyone to hospital. We dealt with smoke inhalation."	Firefighters have rescued 17 people from a six-storey block of flats in Glasgow's west end after a serious fire left them trapped in the building.
The Northern Irishman, twice a winner of the European Tour's season-finale, stumbled to a three-over-par 75 to lie joint 55th in a 60-man field. McIlroy, 27, has never finished worse than 11th in his seven appearances at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai. Westwood, meanwhile, carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66. The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week. Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood. Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan. "I'm disappointed not to be playing," said Westwood. "I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything." The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit. Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament. Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai. Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field. McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field. It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard. Westwood's former Ryder Cup partner Nicolas Colsaerts and France's Julien Quesne share second place on five under, with Sergio Garcia, Francesco Molinari and Joost Luiten a shot further back.	World number two Rory McIlroy had his worst ever round in the DP World Tour Championship to lie nine shots behind first-round leader Lee Westwood.
Mr de Mistura said the agenda would include the formation of a transitional administration and elections. But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm. On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting. Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding "by and large" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned. The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the "preparatory" phase, with both sides blaming each other. It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo. The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front. At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as "a sustained reduction of violence". "Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers," he added. "The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian." Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday. He added that they would once again be indirect "proximity" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week. "We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go onâ€¦ for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can." The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda. The UN has set up two taskforces to deal with those issues, and clearly wants the opposition and government representatives to concentrate on a political settlement, our correspondent adds. UN aid agencies say good progress has been made getting supplies to besieged areas, with almost 240,000 people reached, most of whom received nothing in the last year. But our correspondent says it remains unclear exactly who will arrive in Geneva on Monday, with some opposition leaders suggesting they have not yet decided whether to attend. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein told the BBC that the international system had failed Syria. "We've seen in this conflict... almost every conceivable war crime allegedly being committed, in addition to crimes against humanity," he said. "What does it say to us? It says... that the international system is incapable of addressing this sort of conflict. So future 'Syrias' - we have no algorithm, no formula, for how we address these conflicts. And it doesn't bode well for the 21st Century, of course," he added.	The UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, expects "substantive, deeper" talks between the government and opposition to begin on Monday.
Inflation is among the highest in the world, there are long queues for basic goods and the atmosphere on the streets is becoming increasingly agitated. Meanwhile politicians on both sides are so hostile to each other, a political solution remains remote. For years, the opposition in Venezuela has claimed the country was "becoming another Cuba" but such claims were rarely given much credence, or dismissed as hyperbole. But the BBC's Will Grant, who has lived in both countries, says there are growing parallels to a specific point in Cuba's past. Etched into Cuba's collective memory is its infamous Special Period. A reference to the years just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is a time forever synonymous with suffering, austerity and hunger on the communist island. Without its wealthier benefactors in Eastern Europe, Cuba struggled to provide enough food for its people. The stories from those days are legion. People remember selling family heirlooms to buy food and even stray cats ending up in the cooking pot. Whether the tales are apocryphal or not, Cuba was certainly on its knees economically, and largely remained that way until a leftist former soldier took power in Venezuela. Once Hugo Chavez became the president of Venezuela, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, things quickly started to look up for Cuba. Mr Chavez aligned closely with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and began to fill the gap that the Soviets had left behind. These days, though, Venezuela is the more troubled of the two socialist allies. What's gone wrong in Venezuela? Having lived in Venezuela at the height of Mr Chavez's power, when oil was worth more than $130 a barrel, and having last visited Caracas in April 2013 when Nicolas Maduro was elected president, it was quite a shock to see for myself how quickly things have deteriorated. While the place was always chaotic, run by a sort of live-television ad-hoc form of policy making, I have never seen it quite like this. We encountered the first queue, snaking back for over a block, almost as soon as we emerged into the west of the capital from the airport. It did not take long to see lots more. As in Cuba, the government subsidises and controls the prices of certain basic goods. Now, with inflation spiralling, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans spend their days waiting outside stores for bread, flour, baby milk, cooking oil, nappies and toilet paper. Worse still, many join those queues based on rumour alone, in the forlorn hope of finding those products on the shelves only to be turned away empty handed after hours in the blistering sun. Needless to say, in such circumstances, tempers can easily fray. "We don't sell the subsidised goods," explains Sonia, a 40-year-old storeowner who provided us a little refuge from the pushing and shoving unfolding in the street outside her shop. As we stand on her roof terrace, a healthy distance away from the soldiers who had tried to stop us from recording and to confiscate our equipment, Sonia explains how she and her husband were initially disappointed that they had not been granted the concession to sell government-regulated products a few years ago. But now, she says, it has saved them from the madness that their competitors on the other side of the road are dealing with on a daily basis - desperate crowds and armed troops at the door, the spectre of looting constantly hanging over them. "People can end up killing each other in these situations," she comments, tears forming in her eyes. "It's sad, so sad to live like this. We have young daughters and at times, even we have to resort to buying from the black market." As we watch the troops corralling the queue into order, Sonia points out people she says are "bachaqueros", price speculators and black marketeers who wait in line to purchase food not for their families but to sell on at a huge profit. The black market for basic goods has been thriving in Cuba for decades. It now looks set to become a common feature in Venezuela too. "Venezuelans are good people", she says. "We really don't deserve any of this." Meanwhile, President Maduro came to a regional summit in Cuba to drum up support in his war of words with Luis Almagro, the head of regional body the Organization of American States. The latter recently said the Venezuelan president was in danger of becoming just another "petty dictator in Latin America" and proposed invoking the organisation's democratic charter against him. Cue some pretty earthy language from President Maduro:  "I suggest you put this democratic charter in a very thin tube and find a better use for it, Mr Almagro. You can shove that democratic charter wherever it fits." Of course, back when Cuba was battling through its darkest economic days, Venezuela was very cosy with Washington. President George Bush Snr visited Caracas in 1990, Bill Clinton seven years later. As Nicolas Maduro left Cuba, an island which first formed his socialist ideals, the irony cannot have escaped him - one country recently entertaining the US president as a friend, the other on the brink of economic collapse.

Djokovic won 6-3 7-5 in a largely commanding performance. The 29-year-old, who has now won seven titles this year, has beaten the Japanese on nine successive occasions. Djokovic, who was beaten in the third round at Wimbledon by Sam Querrey, will represent Serbia at the Rio Olympics. "I don't need to explain that every athlete dreams of being a part of the Olympic Games," he said. "I'm competing in singles and doubles. "Hopefully I'll get at least one medal."	World number one Novak Djokovic won his first title since his surprise exit from Wimbledon with a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto.
Giovanni Dixon, 17, of Norwood, stabbed James Hunter in the heart after the 18-year-old tried to protect his friend. The Old Bailey heard Dixon and his friends had set upon Ezekiel Andrews with knives last May and Mr Hunter stepped in to protect him. Dixon was found guilty of murder and wounding and was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. The court heard Mr Andrews, 18, who was described as a "tall and somewhat awkward boy", was punched to the ground, kicked and stabbed three times in the buttocks, following a perceived slight to the gang's friend Jacob Ayoade in the weeks before. Mr Hunter, 18, suggested they fight "one on one" but Dixon rejected that idea and instead stabbed him in the heart on Wells Park Road. The court heard Dixon "jovially" described what he had done as he made his getaway on a bus with his friends Jerome Catterall, 18, Jason Odumusi, 17, and Benedict Leka, 16. Judge Rebecca Poulet QC said the boys' behaviour demonstrated a "preoccupation almost bordering on obsession with knives". Catterall, of Sydenham and Odumusi, from Catford, were cleared of murder but convicted of wounding and sentenced to four and a half years each while Leka, from Forest Hill, who was 15 at the time, received four years for the same offence. Ayoade, from Forest Hill, was sentenced to three years for encouraging the offence and possessing a knife. Judge Poulet lifted a ban on naming all the defendants in light of their convictions.	A teenager "obsessed" with knives who bragged about stabbing a boy in south-east London has been jailed for life.
Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks "resilience". South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have increased by 16% in the last year. It claimed staff shortages contributed to problems in answering calls. In a risk assessment report published by OCCG, it said: "Patient safety in the 111 service will be compromised due to performance issues caused by a lack of resilience to peaks in demand." OCCG has ranked the phone line as a "red risk", the highest category for risks to patient safety. It comes after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph in June recorded a worker at SCAS's 111 call centre in Bicester, Oxfordshire, saying all staff had "killed someone indirectly". After the report prompted an investigation in January, the Care Quality Commission said the service was "safe and effective". The ambulance trust said that a 16% increase in call volume meant phone handlers could not answer calls "as quickly as we would like". In January alone, the service received 173,563 calls on both their 999 and 111 phone lines. SCAS has also said that a recruitment shortfall has contributed to issues in responding to calls. A spokesperson added: "We are working hard to improve our response to the patients who require our assistance. "We are continuing to recruit staff to the NHS 111 service across our area." SCAS provides ambulance services for Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire.	The safety of patients using the 111 service in Oxfordshire could be "compromised", according to the county's leading health body.
Kent closed on 288-5, a lead of 437, opting not to set Essex a target. Essex earlier were bowled out for 292, avoiding the follow-on by one run. Kent were reduced to 40-4 but Northeast shared an unbroken 185 with Will Gidman (63 not out) as runners-up Kent batted through the remainder of the day. The hosts had already secured the six points that guaranteed second place, a promotion spot in any other season. In reality, the prospects of a result were slim as soon as David Masters and Matt Dixon scored the three runs Essex needed to avoid the follow-on, with Dixon then out from the very next ball. Even when Kent slipped to 40-4 and 103-5, it never seemed likely that Essex would be able to force victory without the aid of a declaration. Northeast, an immovable figure, ensured as much, the only excitement coming when he took 30 off one Kishen Velani over - three fours and three sixes. The final over was bowled by retiring Essex seamer David Masters, the 38-year-old ending his first-class career with 672 wickets from 202 matches. He was given a guard of honour that included England Test captain Alastair Cook as he left the field.	Sam Northeast made 178 not out as his Kent side batted out a tame draw against County Championship Division Two champions Essex on the final day of the season at Canterbury.
During his emotional testimony he said Ms Steenkamp died before the ambulance arrived while he was holding her. He said he tried to help her breathe and stem the bleeding from her hip. The athlete denies deliberately shooting dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year, arguing he mistook her for an intruder. Prosecutors contend he intentionally killed her in the toilet of his bathroom after a row. The 27-year-old Olympic and Paralympic sprinter, who is a double amputee, faces life imprisonment if convicted of murder. On Tuesday, he broke down in tears whilst describing the events leading up to the shooting and the actual event. If acquitted, South African law stipulates that the court must consider the separate, lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, for which he could receive between six and 15 years in prison. Mr Pistorius also faces charges of illegally firing a gun in public and of illegally possessing ammunition, both of which he denies. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. On his third day on the stand, Mr Pistorius described the moments after paramedics had arrived at the scene. "They asked for some space to work so I stood up. Reeva had already died whilst I was holding her before the ambulance arrived. So, I knew there was nothing they could do for her," he told the court. He also described his distress as police and other officials arrived at the house. "I asked a policeman if I could wash my hands because the smell of the blood was making me throw up," he said. His lawyer Barry Roux also asked him to demonstrate how he would swing a cricket bat. Mr Pistorius said he was on his prosthetic legs when he used the cricket bat to break down the toilet door. He said the three sounds heard by witnesses at 03:17 local time was the cricket bat hitting the door - about five minutes after he shot at the toilet door. He said he was on his stumps, when he shot at the door. "I can barely stand on my stumps," he said. During his questioning, Mr Roux also mentioned statements from close neighbours who were listed by the state but not called by the prosecution. He said the statement from Kenny Motshoane's house described hearing "crying" and not "a woman screaming", as mentioned by other witnesses. Another woman living nearby also says she heard "loud crying" and not a woman screaming, Mr Roux said. Before Mr Roux ended his questioning he asked Mr Pistorius if he had intentionally killed Ms Steenkamp. "I did not intend to kill Reeva  or anybody else for that matter," he replied. On Tuesday, the athlete described how the couple had spent a quiet evening together on 13 February, Ms Steenkamp doing some yoga as he spoke to his cousin on the phone. He had then watched TV in bed with his head resting on her stomach and she would occasionally show him photos of cars she was looking at on her phone, he said. He said that they had bought Valentine's Day gifts for each other. Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV celebrity and law graduate, was hit by at least three bullets while in the toilet cubicle of Mr Pistorius's home in Pretoria. 1 2 5 4 6 3 Mr Pistorius said in his statement at the start of the trial that he woke in the early hours and  walked on his stumps to the balcony, pulled in two fans, closed the sliding door and drew curtains. He said that shortly before he had spoken to Reeva, who was in bed beside him. He said he rejected prosecution claims that a witness heard arguing coming from the house before the shooting. Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars. "Unbeknown to me, Reeva must have gone to the toilet in the bathroom at the time I brought in the fans," he said. Mr Pistorius said he approached the bathroom armed with his firearm, to defend himself and his girlfriend, believing Ms Steenkamp was still in bed. Both sides agree four bullets were fired. Ms Steenkamp was hit three times. Mr Pistorius said he fired his weapon after hearing a noise in the toilet which he thought was the intruder coming out of the toilet to attack him and Ms Steenkamp. He said he was in a fearful state, knowing he was on his stumps and unable to run away or properly defend himself. Mr Pistorius said he rejected claims that he was on his prostheses when he shot at the door. A witness told the trial she woke to hear a woman screaming and a man shouting for help. She said that after the screams she heard four shots. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva. Lifting himself up onto the bed, he felt over to the right hand side of it and noticed Ms Steenkamp was not there. Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bathroom but the toilet was locked, so he returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs, turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat. Forensics expert Johannes Vermeulen told the court that the height of the marks on the door caused by the cricket bat suggest Mr Pistorius was on his stumps at the time. Mr Pistorius's defence team say he then called security at the gated housing complex and a private paramedic service before carrying Ms Steenkamp downstairs. A security guard claimed it was the other way round, and he had called Mr Pistorius first after reports of gunfire. However, phone records shown to the court revealed Mr Pistorius called the estate manager at 3:19am, a minute later he called the ambulance service and at 3:21am he called estate security. A minute later he received an incoming call - estate security calling him back. According to police phone expert Francois Moller, Mr Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris a short time later and just after 4:00am he called his brother Carl.	South African athlete Oscar Pistorius is back in court in Pretoria describing events after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home.
At a fringe meeting about which political party best spoke for the working class, Tim Aker said the 2005 ban had upped levels of hidden drinking by forcing people "to retreat inwards". It was evidence of a "bankrupt" Labour telling people "what to do and think". Senior UKIP figures have also targeted new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. UKIP made big inroads into traditional Labour heartlands in May's election - coming second to the party in a host of seats in the north of England - but it has been suggested that Mr Corbyn's election could halt this momentum. But Mr Aker, who lost to Labour by 800 votes in Thurrock in May, said Labour had "ceased to exist" as a party of working people, choosing to "lecture rather than represent them". Citing the smoking ban as an example of a policy that had hit C1 and C2 workers, he said: "They (Labour) say all the time, despite ignoring the facts, that it was the pit closures that destroyed all the communities. "But I put it to you that the smoking ban has destroyed more communities than any any pit closure has done because when people don't have a place to meet, a place to socialise, they retreat in. "What sort of outcome is it to say 'we don't want you drinking and smoking, take it out of the licensed area', and it goes all the way back to the homes where people are drinking and smoking more in front of their children." In contrast to Labour, he said, UKIP would stand up for working people by giving them more power over their lives. "We are the ones that embrace the one concept that has helped working class voters more than the minimum wage, more than anything else - the greatest thing for the working class is democracy." Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Aker said the closure of pubs in many communities meant "there was no community left". He insisted he did not mean to "belittle the hardships of those who lost their jobs in the pits" but sought to "draw a parallel between their closures and the closure of pubs". Speaking at the same meeting, former vice-chairman Suzanne Evans said Mr Corbyn was an "unreconstructed communist and like all communists it is the poorest who will suffer (under him)". And speaking in the hall, deputy leader Paul Nuttall said Mr Corbyn was a "trendy lefty" rather than a working class hero and suggested that working people would not warm to a man "who says nice things about the IRA, wants to give the Falklands back to the Argentinians and, above all, won't sing the national anthem". More than ever before, he suggested, UKIP was poised to become the alternative to Labour in the Midlands and the north of England and to the Tories in the south of England. But it would only continue to make inroads in the traditional Labour vote if it was "bold and told it like it is". He added: "We must not tone down our language. We must not change. If we change and sound like all the rest, we are finished." Meanwhile, Matthew Goodwin - professor of politics at the University of Kent and the author of a book on UKIP's rise - has cast doubt on whether Mr Corbyn's election will stop the leaching of Labour votes to UKIP. Mr Goodwin told the fringe meeting that past assumptions that UKIP voters were "exiled Tories who liked to wear tweed and corduroy and spend most of their time playing golf" had been scotched by its performance in May - when it attracted 29% of working class votes, compared with Labour's 27%. "Labour is in real trouble among these groups and it is not a problem that is going to be fixed by Jeremy Corbyn," he said. But he warned that UKIP, as well as other parties, risked losing working class voters to "political apathy".	A UKIP MEP has told the party's conference the ban on smoking in public places in England has "damaged more communities than the pit closures did".
Dean Melnyk, 20, of Lockerbie, was found guilty by a jury of murdering Kevin MacKay in Ecclefechan. Co-accused Andrew Brown, 23, of Ecclefechan, had previously admitted the attack in August last year. Judge Lord Armstrong deferred sentence until June when he will determine how long they have to serve before being eligible to apply for parole. The pair believed their 39-year-old victim had supplied the drugs which had killed their teenage friend Jamie Abba - nicknamed Jabba. The High Court in Glasgow heard the attack on Mr MacKay took place just hours after the 19-year-old's funeral. Melnyk told jurors that he was "drunk and angry" when he and Brown went to Peacock Place in Ecclefechan on 22 August last year and attacked Mr MacKay - known as Kesty. During his trial he denied murdering Mr MacKay, but admitted culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility. However, the jury rejected the suggestion that he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the killing. Melnyk said he was devastated when Mr Abba died and suffered nightmares and flashbacks in which his friend appeared to him and said: "Help me." The court heard that at the teenager's wake Melnyk had become increasingly angry  and at one point Brown - known as Buster - came over and spoke to him. "Buster said 'We'll go and give Kesty a kicking' to try and cheer me up," Melnyk said. He told the court that the two got a lift to Ecclefechan and, after going into another house in the village, Brown led him to where Mr MacKay was staying. He added: "We both had a knife each - I saw Buster stabbing Kesty. "Kesty was on his feet and Buster was stabbing him. "I was in shock - Buster was turning the furniture over and shouting: 'You killed Jabba, Kesty.'" Melnyk said Mr MacKay had spotted he had a knife and had grabbed his leg. "I couldn't get him off me, he was much bigger," he told the court. "Buster kicked him off and I began stabbing Kesty - I don't know how many times. "The handle broke off the knife." The court heard that after the killing, Melnyk made his way to a friend's house in Lockerbie and told him: "I think I've killed Kesty." Brown, a fisherman, told police that Mr MacKay had been attacked by two men wearing balaclavas and he had tried to help fight them off. A charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice against Jennifer Melnyk, 60, was dropped during the trial. Police in Dumfries and Galloway said they hoped the village could "start to move forward" after the convictions. Ch Insp Steven Lowther said: "The village and community of Ecclefechan have gone through a traumatic time recently. "The death of Jamie Abba and the murder of Kevin MacKay have left two families devastated. "These events have clearly affected the wider community as well." He said police would work hard with residents to "help bring some sort of normality back to the village". "Of course we understand that there are still tensions in and around the village," he added. "However, we want to make it quite clear that, as in the past, tensions which boil over into acts which break the law will be dealt with firmly and robustly."	Two men are facing life sentences for stabbing a man they blamed for the drugs death of a friend.
The A&E unit at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital could be downgraded, leaving the Royal Shrewsbury as the only hospital in the county to offer emergency and critical care. Women and children's services would also be moved to Shrewsbury, despite a Â£28m centre opening in Telford in 2014. The proposals have been made by the NHS 'Future Fit' board. More updates on this and other stories in Shropshire Urgent care centres would be based at both sites, which Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said would attend to the majority of patients who are currently seen at A&E. These "preferred options" will be considered by Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Shropshire CCG, who will formally decide if a public consultation can begin. The board is also recommending three other options be put forward for public consultation. No formal decisions will be made until at least Summer 2017, Telford and Wrekin CCG said. The NHS Future Fit programme was launched in 2014 to review the health system across Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and mid-Wales and is set to finish in spring 2017. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford: Royal Shrewsbury Hospital: There has been criticism of the plans to move women's and children's services from Telford. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, described the announcement as "a total farce that is being railroaded through" and said he opposed the idea of downgrading Telford's A&E department. "If there is to be only one, then it makes sense from a financial and clinical perspective to locate it at Princess Royal Hospital; in the area where there is a growing population."	Shropshire could have one emergency and trauma department under recommendations being put forward by NHS bosses.
The event represents the final opportunity for GB to attain a maximum of two berths (one male and one female) for August's Rio Olympics. The UK Sport-funded GB women's team will need to rank in the top six from nations who have not already qualified. "We'll give it our all to qualify for the Olympics in Rio this summer," Smith told BBC Sport. "It's going to be a tough competition but I'm confident in my preparations." Commonwealth champion Smith is the lead candidate to represent Team GB should the GB women claim a berth, but rising star Rebekah Tiler is expected to rival her. Ex-England lifter Hannah Powell - who now aims to represent Wales - will line up at her first major international since the 2011 World Championships. The unfunded British men's team need a top-seven place at the European Championships in Forde, which run from 10 to 16 April. They are boosted by Welsh lifter Darius Jokarzadeh's first appearance in the sport since finishing fourth at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The US-based athlete, who wants to be an American footballer, is joined by Olympian Gareth Evans and British champion Sonny Webster in the squad. "Qualification for this summer's Olympic Games remains extremely competitive," British Weight Lifting performance director Tommy Yule said. "Our elite lifters have proven themselves more than up to the challenge, however, and have a terrific opportunity in Norway to seal Olympic qualification." Should GB attain a place or places at the Rio Olympics then athletes will bid to represent Team GB through performances at the British Championships in June.	London Olympian Zoe Smith will lead a 14-strong British team at April's European Championships in Norway.
Robert Kerr, 39, inflicted 76 wounds on 39-year-old Xin Xin Liu at their home in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire. The Crown accepted his plea to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility after it emerged he suffered "an abnormality of the mind". Kerr will remain at the State Hospital under an interim compulsion order. At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Boyd imposed the interim compulsion order for Kerr to remain at Carstairs and the case was adjourned until November. The court heard that Xin Xin had moved to Scotland from China around 15 years ago to study law at Aberdeen University. It was there she met Kerr, who was completing a computer course. They were married in 2003. Kerr was latterly a lecturer at West College Scotland in Paisley, while Xin Xin was training to be a translator. They were described as a "quiet and private couple" with family not aware of any problems between them. In April this year - weeks before the killing - Kerr had contacted his GP complaining of stress in respect of "work and personal issues". He added he was suffering from anxiety, insomnia and spoke about "paranoid feelings". Four days before the attack, Kerr spoke to a nurse and said he had been feeling much better and appeared to be sounding "chirpier". The court heard that on 26 April, however, Kerr attacked Xin Xin as their two sons slept upstairs. Just before midnight, he dialled 999 and admitted: "I have just killed my wife. I murdered her in a stabbing frenzy." He went on to state there was "blood all over the place". Police discovered Xin Xin lying on the kitchen floor with a knife still in her body. After being held, Kerr then told officers: "I found out tonight they were not mine." Prosecutor Jane Farquharson said he had "suspicions" that a friend was the father of his children. Ms Farquharson told the court: "A paternity test recently carried out...has since confirmed that Robert Kerr is the biological father." A number of blood-stained items were found at the couple's house, including a milk carton. The advocate depute said: "Kerr has since admitted that he had made himself a hot drink after this incident." A post mortem later revealed Xin Xin had suffered a total of 76 wounds. The court heard that Kerr had since been receiving treatment at the State Hospital at Carstairs. One doctor concluded that his "ability to control his conduct" that night was "substantially impaired by reason of abnormality of mind". He was said to be suffering from a "delusional disorder" including his belief about the paternity of his children.	A college lecturer has admitting killing his wife in "a stabbing frenzy" after wrongly believing he was not the father of their two children.
A small crowd cheered and applauded as the skyline went dark. The Opera House was lit in a deep shade of green to symbolise renewable energy. The annual event is organised by WWF, the global environment campaign. It encourages cities and individuals to switch off non-essential lights for an hour at 20:30 local time. Critics have dismissed the campaign, now into its seventh year, as a gimmick of little or no practical benefit. This year, Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking part for the first time. The Kremlin due to switch off its lights at 16:30 GMT along with 90 other landmark buildings in Moscow. Sydney cut its lights at 09:30 GMT. "It's really exciting," local resident Jessica Bellamy told AFP news agency. "It's been a very inspiring night because it's all about hope and change." One person wrote on Twitter: "Sydney Harbour bridge is in darkness for Earth Hour. You can even see the stars!"	Australia's biggest city, Sydney, has switched off its lights for an hour as the Earth Day climate change protest gets under way across the globe.
Both 48-hour and 24-hour strikes have already been held on seven Shell-operated platforms. Further action was planned but was put on hold for fresh talks. Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions said in a statement they had held two full days of constructive discussions which would continue next week. The statement said: "These collaborative discussions have demonstrated a clear, shared understanding of the issues being raised by all parties, plus the challenges facing the North Sea. "We remain focused on reaching a mutually-acceptable outcome, which demonstrates collective leadership in shaping the future of the North Sea." The initial 24-hour strike on 26 July was the first industrial action of its kind in the North Sea in nearly 30 years and was followed by a 48-hour stoppage the following week. The platforms involved are the Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie, Nelson, Gannet and Shearwater. Aberdeen-based Wood Group provides maintenance and construction to Shell and signed a three-year extension to its contract earlier this year.	"Constructive" talks have been held between unions and the Wood Group in an ongoing dispute involving offshore workers.
About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with the French consulate in London. Marie Brousseau-Navarro, the Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, said messages of support had been touching. She said: "We are united in shock and united in sorrow... And united with all the people who have marched across the world." Saleem Kidwai, chairman of the Muslim Council of Wales was applauded by the crowd as he told them to "stand together shoulder to shoulder". "My condemnation is absolute," he said. "We will eventually win and truth wins over falsehood and light over darkness." First Minister Carwyn Jones was among the many to hold up a candle for the silence, while others held up pencils. The silence was marked at the end by an applause. Earlier, he said: "The vigil in Cardiff Bay tonight is an opportunity for the people of Wales to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the truly abhorrent attack in Paris. "It is also a chance to show solidarity with the people of France and all those who believe in upholding our democratic values and freedoms that are threatened by such senseless acts of terror." Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted earlier: "Standing with the French community in Wales and in support of freedom of speech everywhere. 6pm this eve. Senedd, Cardiff. #CharlieHebdo" In a show of unity, London landmarks have been lit in the colours of the French national flag. And world leaders have gathered in Paris for a huge unity march involving over one million people, dwarfing Saturday's marches that saw 700,000 take to the streets. On Saturday, Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis dedicated his side's goal in the 1-1 draw with West Ham to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Wales' police forces and media organisations held a minute's silence to support those attacked in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris on Wednesday. A police officer was killed on Thursday and French forces stormed two separate hostage sites in and around Paris, killing three hostage takers, on Friday. "We have been really moved by the hundreds of messages of support and condolences," said Ms Brousseau-Navarro. "Most of all we appreciate the support and solidarity."	A vigil has taken place in Cardiff Bay for French citizens and others following terror acts in Paris which left 17 people dead in three days.
Lancaster left the role on Wednesday after England's World Cup failure. Gatland's Wales beat England at Twickenham to help the hosts' demise and he has been linked with a move. New Zealander Gatland is contracted to Wales until 2019 and Thomas believes "he'll see his time out with Wales and probably go back to New Zealand". Gatland has said he intends to step down from the Wales role after the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Thomas also believes Gatland will have "one eye on coaching New Zealand after a successful run with Wales and with the British and Irish Lions". However, former Lion Thomas says he understands why the English Rugby Football Union might want to have Gatland in charge - even if Wales' record against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa has not matched their Six Nations efforts under him. "I'm sure England would want to make a move for someone like him after seeing what he's done for Wales," said Gatland. "Since he's been in charge, Wales have been an amazingly successful - unfortunately not against the mights of the southern hemisphere as much as he would like. "But we are such a force now in world rugby and are feared and respected, and that's due to the players, yes, but also due to him and the structure he's given the players. "So I'm sure they'd want him and if anybody could afford him, the RFU, I'm sure, could." South Africa's 2007 World Cup-winning coach Jake White "is interested" in the England job.	Former Wales captain Gareth Thomas doubts head coach Warren Gatland could be tempted to succeed Stuart Lancaster as England boss.
Kirsty Blackman, SNP MP for Aberdeen North, found a toy rabbit at the Carriage Gates entrance last July. She tried to trace the owner on social media but no-one came forward for months. After turning to Mumsnet, a user got in touch at Hogmanay, saying the toy belonged to her six-year-old daughter. The woman said she worked near Westminster at the time and her daughter was "gutted" when the bunny went missing as they had been "inseparable since birth". She reclaimed the toy on a visit to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Ms Blackman updated followers on the toy's time at Westminster, including pictures of her and the Jellycat Bashful Bunny with Big Ben behind them and at Prime Minister's Questions. She also drafted an Early Day Motion stating the House of Commons is "saddened by the discovery of the abandoned bashful bunny by the gates of the Palace of Westminster" which was not submitted to parliament but was signed by several SNP colleagues. Ms Blackman said previously: "I have two young children, so I know the devastation that can be caused when a toy is lost."	An MP who issued a social medial appeal after discovering a soft toy abandoned outside the House of Commons has reunited it with its young owner.
Hutchinson is involved in metal design and manufacturing and laser cutting. The jobs will be recruited over the next three years. A further 40 new jobs have been filled in the past nine months at the company. The jobs consist of manufacturing roles, business development and sales and marketing. It is part of a Â£4.1m investment supported by Invest Northern Ireland. The investment includes the expansion of the company's Kilrea site and further investment in laser technology with the addition of two new lasers.	Forty jobs are being created in Kilrea, County Londonderry, and in Antrim town, by manufacturing company the Hutchinson Group.
Royal Mail said the rise of delivery firm Whistl could wipe £200m off sales. It also said competition was endangering its government-mandated Universal Service, which guarantees a single price postal service that delivers to all UK addresses. The caution came as Royal Mail reported a small fall in pre-tax profits. They dropped to £218m for the six months to 28 September, from £233m in the same period last year. In its financial statement, Royal Mail named Whistl, formerly known as TNT, as a direct threat to future profits. The company also said it faced increased parcel competition and that Amazon's recently-launched delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as 2%, in the short term. In the past six months, Royal Mail's UK parcel delivery division saw revenues fall by 1%. However the firm's international parcel delivery service, GLS, fared well, with revenue up 7%, helping the company's overall revenue to rise by just £5m to slightly above £4.52bn. Royal Mail's letter business saw volumes drop by 3%, although this was not as steep a fall as had been expected. The slower decline was due to election pamphleteering, particularly relating to the Scottish Referendum, for which Royal Mail delivered seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene told the BBC that increased competition was threatening the company's ability to deliver letters to all parts of the UK - a service mandated by law. She added that the "cherry-picking" of urban mail routes by competitors "undermines the economics" of its nationwide delivery service. Royal Mail has long called for the regulator, Ofcom, to consider expanding the Universal Service mandate - which ensures mail is delivered across the UK, six days a week, at one fixed price - so that it includes rivals such as Whistl. That may include forcing competitors to also deliver letters to rural areas at an affordable price - a service for which companies can make little or no profit. "We believe the current regulatory framework does not fully address the problem posed by unfettered direct delivery competition," Royal Mail said. "We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future." In response, a spokesman for Ofcom said the regulator's own evidence "clearly shows that the service is not currently under threat". "We would assess any emerging threat to the service quickly, in the interests of postal users," he added. Royal Mail has been under increased public scrutiny since it was privatised in October 2013. In July, a group of MPs voiced concerns that the taxpayer may have lost out by about £1bn after Royal Mail shares were "undervalued". After an initial pricing of 330p, Royal Mail shares rose above 600p in the months after its flotation, but have been steadily declining since the early summer, to 430p. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor Lurking on page 8 of today's numbers is the real story in Royal Mail's results - that the business is warning of a "material risk" to the Universal Service obligation. Some may dismiss this as special pleading from a company that does not much like competition. But I have just spoken to the Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, and she is clear - if action isn't taken now, Royal Mail's ability to fund the six day letter delivery service across the UK will come under possibly unmanageable strain. "The threat is now," she told me.	Shares in Royal Mail closed down 8.3% after the firm warned that rivals - including Amazon - were eating into its parcel delivery business.
Scottish Hydro-Electric Transmission Ltd, a division of energy giant SSE, submitted the "needs case" as part of the planning process for the cable. After assessing the case, energy regulator Ofgem has asked for further details to be submitted. The project has been hit by delays and a rise in costs to an estimated Â£780m. Islands local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has said major renewable energy projects planned for the isles cannot go ahead without the cable. The interconnector would export electricity to the mainland for distribution. It would stretch to about 50 miles (80km) from Gravir on Lewis to Ullapool on the north-west coast of mainland Scotland. The Scottish government has been involved in talks on the project. A spokesperson said: "This is a matter for SSE and Ofgem, but we would encourage the company and regulator to move swiftly to resolve this issue. "Improved grid connections will enable the huge renewable energy resources of Scotland's islands to create jobs - up to 3,500 jobs in the Western Isles, almost 2,900 in the Shetlands and over 4,500 in the Orkney Islands by 2030. The spokesperson added: "SSE put a business case for the Western Isles link to the electricity regulator Ofgem on 14 June, and today Ofgem have responded by setting out the detailed further information they require."	Ofgem has asked for more information on why a subsea cable is needed to carry electricity generated on the Western Isles to the mainland.
Mike Welch, chief executive of Blackcircles.com, can expect to gain a third of that sale price, while staying with the company. He started selling tyres aged 16 before joining Kwik-Fit. Aged 21, he set up Black Circles, basing it in Peebles, where it employs 50 people. Welch, now aged 36, built it up to annual sales in 2013 of £28m, with annual growth of around 20% per year since 2008.  The first three months of this year have seen revenue rise by 34% on the same period last year. The company developed a "click and fit" business model. Customers choose their tyres online, they are then delivered directly from manufacturers to one of 1,350 independent garages, where the customer then books in a tyre-fitting session. According to the chief executive, prices undercut conventional sales by 20%-to-40%. In March, the company announced that it was looking at ways to extend its growth, including a float on a stock exchange, private equity investment, or a sale. It recruited former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy onto the board, to use his expertise in retail. There is also a trial of a Blackcircles fitting service at some Tesco superstores. The Michelin deal opens up expertise and a much wider distribution network, without limiting Blackcircles.com to the parent company's brand products. Michelin already owns the conventional tyre distributor ATS Euromaster, and the French firm hopes there will be synergies between the two distributors, although Blackcircles.com will continue to operate independently within the Michelin group. "I'm delighted to have found in Michelin a partner who shares our passion for customer service, innovation and technology," said Mr Welch. "The strength of the Michelin Group will allow us to underpin the multi-brand offering that we deploy in each garage, on every street corner. "I am convinced that our teams, our customers, our garages and our suppliers will rapidly start to see the benefits of this partnership." Jean-Dominique Senard, chief executive of the Michelin Group, commented: "Our strategy illustrates our ambition: to be ever more innovative, efficient and proactive for our customers by offering them products and services suited to individual needs, and by simplifying the entire purchase process, from choosing their tyres to having them fitted by professionals." Michelin has 68 production plants in 17 countries, and employs 117,000 people. An interview with Mike Welch can be heard on Business Scotland this weekend - at 06:00 on Saturday and 07:30 on Sunday - on BBC Radio Scotland.	One of Scotland's most successful entrepreneurs has sold his tyre-fitting business for £50m to Michelin.
Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates. But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable. Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty. The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13. In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels. But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments. SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was "gravely concerned" by the developments. She said: "The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises." She added: "I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here." Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management  about the need to protect jobs. She said: "It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way." Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty. "There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards," he said. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed. She said: "He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year. "That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number." A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: "Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow. "We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process. Our focus is to deliver the capability the Royal Navy needs, while ensuring the best value for UK taxpayers."	First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for "cast iron assurances" jobs will not be lost at Clyde shipyards because of contract delays.
La Gommeuse achieved the top price of $67.5m (£45m) at Sotheby's, as part of their Impressionist & Modern Art sale on Thursday. And Van Gogh's atmospheric landscape, Paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (£36m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (£203m). Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it "a small sale that packed a real punch". He added: "Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper." La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (£202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (£182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (£244.5m). This total brings Sotheby's sales of Impressionist & Modern Art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (£381m), Earlier this year, Picasso's Women of Algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, going for $160m (£102.6m) at Christie's in New York.	A new record for a blue period Picasso has been set at auction in New York.
The study says girls as young as 10 are forced to marry much older men in countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Somalia. Save the Children says early marriage can trigger a cycle of disadvantage across every part of a girl's life. Conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are seen as major factors that leave girls exposed to child marriage. "Child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children," said Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt. "Girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to STIs (sexually transmitted infections) including HIV." The girl who said no to child marriage Europe struggles with migrant child brides Gambia and Tanzania ban child marriages Big money for Niger's child brides The report, called Every Last Girl, ranks countries based on the hardest place to be a girl based on schooling, child marriage, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and the number of women in parliament. Chad, Niger, Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia were ranked at the bottom of the index. The report says girls affected by conflict are more likely to become child brides. It says many refugee families marry off their daughters as a way to protect them against poverty or sexual exploitation. The charity used the example of a 13-year-old Syrian refugee in Lebanon it called Sahar - not her real name - who was married to a 20-year-old man. Now 14, she is two months pregnant. "The wedding day, I was imagining it would be a great day but it wasn't. It was all misery. It was full of sadness," Save the Children quoted her as saying. "I feel really blessed that I am having a baby. But I am a child raising a child." The report says girls also suffer during humanitarian crises such as the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone where the shutting down of schools led to an estimated 14,000 teen pregnancies. The UN children's agency, Unicef, estimates that the number of women married in childhood will grow from 700 million today to around 950 million by 2030. The Save the Children's report coincides with International Day of the Girl on Tuesday.	One girl under the age of 15 is married every seven seconds, according to a new report by Save the Children.
East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust serves a population of more than 750,000 people across five different hospitals. Experts from health regulator Monitor also identified issues with safety, leadership and "a culture of bullying". The trust said it would "work to make improvements to the services". It was deemed inadequate by the independent watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, in August. The trust runs the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford; the Kent and Canterbury in Canterbury; the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (QEQM) in Margate; the Buckland in Dover; and the Royal Victoria in Folkestone. Concerns were raised about a culture of bullying at the organisation and inspectors identified staff shortages in A&E, children's care and at night. They found risks to patients and incidents involving patient safety were not always identified. The inspection team also noticed that in a number of areas around the trust, buildings and equipment were "poorly maintained". Monitor said it would be appointing an improvement director at the trust to provide support and to ensure it is making progress. "The trust needs to urgently improve the safety of care for patients, and strengthen its management to better support frontline staff," said Paul Streat, regional director at Monitor. "By putting the trust into special measures we can ensure they turn things around quickly. "Senior leaders need to listen to and work with all staff to understand and tackle problems on their wards," he said. Patients visiting the Kent and Canterbury Hospital on Tuesday said they had no confidence in the management. Former cancer patient Ken Rogers, who quit in July as a governor, said: "I've argued with the trust over some of the performance results of what they've been doing to patients and they haven't listened." Robert Watts, who was at the hospital with his wife and baby son, said: "You want the best. You want to be told the right things and hope that they do the best job they can. "Sometimes they don't, they miss it. I just don't think that this hospital can do that." The trust's chief executive, Stuart Bain, said: "We want to work with our regulator Monitor, our staff and our health partners to make improvements to the services we provide to the people of east Kent." He said areas for improvement had already been recognised including the investment of an additional Â£2.9m to recruit 69 nurses where shortages existed. An additional four general surgeons had also been recently appointed and a further three would be recruited shortly, Mr Bain added. "In addition we identified the need to improve our appointment system some time ago and have just completed a public consultation on our outpatient services that will allow us to make improvements to the services we offer patients. "New appointment booking systems, more flexible appointments, and an investment of Â£28m in improved facilities including a new hospital in Dover will start to address these issues," he said. "The trust is committed to working with staff and health partners to produce an action plan to address the issues raised by the CQC and Monitor and to see us removed from special measures as soon as possible."	One of the largest hospital trusts in England is to be put into special measures because of "serious failures" in patient safety.
Scott Carson was at full stretch to tip a header from Brentford's John Egan behind, while Tom Ince saw his free-kick turned over by visiting keeper Daniel Bentley. The visitors almost scored when Scott Hogan rounded Carson, but he could only find the side netting. Derby, who have just seven goals in 13 games, are three points off relegation. Johnny Russell and Ince had the Rams' best second-half chances, while Romaine Sawyers had a penalty shout waved away for Brentford. Despite the lack of goals, Steve McClaren's Derby side are now on a four-game unbeaten run, conceding just once in the process. Their lack of attacking impetus was compounded by James Wilson's knee injury in training, and they also lost Will Hughes, who limped off midway through the first half. Brentford, winless in three games, are just a point outside the top six and rarely looked in trouble against their hosts. The clean sheet was their first against Derby in 11 attempts, going back to 1953, and they have not won an away game against the Rams since 1939. Derby County manager Steve McClaren:  "The first half was too slow, no tempo and a little too safe. "But we've got to play football with these players, they are football players, we can't play long ball. "At times they are making mistakes but that will progress and will get better and I had no faults apart from in the final third where we needed that bit of magic. "A draw was probably a fair result, we huffed and puffed without blowing the house down." Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I don't know if we deserved to win but we certainly deserved a penalty. "It was a double whammy and how it's not given I don't know. I think their bench was embarrassed it wasn't given as well. "I thought our performance was very good, very disciplined and the intensity of pressing in our half was very good.

Aker Solutions said employees had been told about 650 positions, mainly in the UK, Norway and India, may be affected. A more specific breakdown for Aberdeen and London jobs has not been announced. A spokesperson said: "The adjustments are being made because of the continued market slowdown and as part of a global reorganization that will strengthen the company's competitiveness." Aker employs about 15,000 people, of which more than 2,000 are in the UK, the majority of them in Aberdeen and offshore.	Hundreds of jobs are set to go at oil services firm Aker Solutions with about 100 at risk in Aberdeen and London.
Operation Anagram was formed by Strathclyde Police in 2006 after Tobin raped and murdered 23-year-old Polish student Angelika Kluk in Glasgow. It also helped convict him of the murders of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol and 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton. Police said that while the operation was being scaled back it would never end. Det Sup David Swindle, who formed the operation, said anyone with information regarding Peter Tobin would still be able to contact the Anagram incident room via e-mail which would be monitored daily. "Since Operation Anagram was formed in 2006, I could never have believed the momentum and magnitude it would have developed into," he said. "The public response and assistance from the media has been unbelievable. "The long-running investigation has brought some solace to the families of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol in knowing what happened to their loved ones." Det Sup Swindle said that although Anagram had not uncovered other murder victims of Tobin to date, he was "proud" of its "success in bringing closure" to some bereaved families. He added: "I leave Strathclyde Police after 34 years in the knowledge that we have tried our best to find out the truth of what Tobin has done and also with confidence that the Anagram processes built up over the last four and a half years ensures a life long awareness of this cowardly, vicious serial killer Tobin. "Any new information coming to light will continue to be researched which may bring similar closure to other families. "The search for the truth about what Peter Tobin has done will continue." Tobin is serving three life sentences for the murders of Vicky Hamilton, Dinah McNicol and Angelika Kluk. Ms Kluk was raped and murdered at a church in Glasgow in 2006. The bodies of Ms McNicol, from Essex, and Ms Hamilton, from Redding in Falkirk, were found the following year in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent. Operation Anagram has helped piece together a timeline of Tobin's movements and relationships over decades in a bid to determine whether he is responsible for other unsolved crimes.	A dedicated police operation set up to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin is to be wound down.
The three-month tests of 137 island homes, 73 in Guernsey and 64 in Jersey, measured the level of gas in the walls. Radon occurs naturally in areas with a large amount of granite and 99 of the homes tested were below target levels. Fourteen island homes were above the target level and owners have been told to ensure there is good ventilation. The survey was carried by the islands' authorities with the UK Health Protection Agency. The 137 properties were selected to cover a range of geological conditions and population areas. The aim was to find out more about radon and its distribution. Val Cameron, the Channel Islands strategic lead for environmental health, said: "The recent survey updates and confirms the information from previous surveys; this is that radon is associated with the granite geology of the island, and not the construction material of an individual building." International research has found exposure to radon gas can increase the chances of contracting lung cancer for people who smoke. Dr Susan Turnbull, medical officer of health for Jersey, said: "To help put the main risk factors for the commonest form of lung cancer into perspective, for every 100 cases of lung cancer around 95 will have been caused by smoking alone, about four will be due to the combined effects of smoking and radon exposure. "Only one will be due to radon exposure alone. So it is a real risk, albeit a low one. The most sensible thing anyone can do to reduce their risk of getting lung cancer is to stop smoking." Mrs Cameron said: "Of the homes surveyed, some were identified as being above the action level. Advice has been given to those householders about measures to remedy the problem." Previously radon surveys were carried out in Jersey in 1987, 1992 and 1997, and in Guernsey in 1985. In 2012, tests were also carried out in Herm, Alderney and Sark. In 1984 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the International Commission on Radiological Protection reported on the need for a reduction of radon exposures in homes.	The amount of radon gas found in the Channel Islands is associated with the geology of the island and not construction materials, a survey finds.
He is one of 249 men suing the Catholic Church over alleged historical sexual abuse at St William's residential school in Market Weighton. Only one man out of five initial cases heard at the High Court in Leeds has been awarded compensation. In December, a judge ruled in favour of one claimant and ordered the church to pay Â£14,000 in damages. At the same hearing, His Honour Judge Gosnell dismissed three other claims. More on this and other East Yorkshire stories In January 2016 the former head of St William's James Carragher was jailed for the third time after he was found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Carragher, 75, had already been sentenced to 21 years in prison for sexually abusing boys and was jailed for a further nine years in January. He was jailed for seven years in 1993 and a further 14 years in 2004 for offences he committed at St William's, which closed in 1992. Co-defendant Anthony McCallen, 69, a former chaplain at St William's, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of historical sex offences. He was acquitted of eight other charges at the same trial. The De La Salle Brothers, a Christian order of lay teachers, which ran the school in conjunction with the Diocese of Middlesbrough, has apologised "unreservedly" for the abuse. Another set of compensation claims is expected to be heard in late 2017.	A man who claimed he was abused at an East Yorkshire Catholic school has lost a legal action for compensation.
About 14m birds are bred for the table a year. Processing companies are big employers and the industry sustains thousands of jobs on farms and in factories. But poultry has a problem - how to deal with the waste it generates. At the moment, the millions of birds reared in Northern Ireland create 260,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year. The litter is a mix of bedding and droppings and if the industry expands, it could generate 400,000 tonnes of waste annually. For the moment, much of the waste is spread as fertiliser on fields. But it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can run off into rivers and lakes and damage them - a process known as eutrophication. European Union regulations are in place to stop that. To show it is making progress, Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste. The Northern Ireland Executive has set up a £15-20m fund to try to find an answer and soon it will be spending some of that cash. It will be lent to companies who will use it to part fund at least two "demonstrator" plants to test new technology. They would be expected to deal with at least 20,000 tonnes of waste a year. Six applications have been assessed by the business development agency, Invest NI. Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said at Christmas that schemes based on anaerobic digestion (AD) were furthest advanced in the selection process. Anaerobic digestion uses micro-organisms to break down organic matter inside a sealed and heated system. That gives off a biogas which can be burned to produce heat and power, but there is a problem with using AD technology for this. Unless expensive stripping processes are included, the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorous going into the system in the poultry litter, will be present in the byproduct, or digestate, when it comes out. If you want to spread the digestate on land, you will face the same potential problems with eutrophication. That is why, in 2014, a report commissioned by the agriculture minister said anaerobic digestion was not the answer to the poultry litter problem. However, it seems officials are determined to overcome this issue with the AD projects being assessed for funding. The Department of Agriculture has said that, in those projects, the digestate would either be exported for field spreading or further refined to separate out the nutrients in pellet form. The first loan agreement with Invest NI was expected to be signed by the end of last year. The minister said that once the finance was in place, she expected the first plants could be operational by late 2016 or early 2017.	Poultry meat is big business in Northern Ireland - worth £205m in 2014.
After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the "two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship". Although there was some "common ground" on Syria, "broad differences" remained. Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome "time-bomb issues" inherited from Barack Obama's administration. Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead. The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response. Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators. It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria. Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank. Mr Tillerson said: "I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries." He added: "We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us." It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: "We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia." Mr Trump said "it would be a fantastic thing" if the nations improved ties, but warned "it may be just the opposite". Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the "irritants that piled up under the Obama administration". Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack. But it was obvious there were many differences. Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack "was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces". He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as "an animal" was "a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself". Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed. There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success. Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had "a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington". Afterwards he said "we understand each other better" and there were "many prospects for co-operation with the US". He said there were "certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well". Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria. Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: "Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now." He later called Mr Assad a "butcher". Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile. He said: "Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any." Referring to the US air strike, he said: "But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact." And despite hopes that US-Russia ties would improve under a Trump presidency, Mr Putin said: "One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated."	US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve.
Supporters and colleagues gathered outside the Alvorada Palace to bid her farewell, some handing her flowers. Ms Rousseff was dismissed last week after the Senate found her guilty of manipulating the budget. She denies wrongdoing and has dismissed her impeachment as a "coup d'etat". Brazilian television showed Ms Rousseff walking out of the presidential residence surrounded by former ministers and Congressmen from her Workers' Party. How will history look back on impeachment? Profile: Dilma Rousseff Supporter Cecilia Monteir, 56, said she was "very, very sad, feeling like the country will be left a bit orphaned". More supporters awaited Ms Rousseff as she arrived at an airport to board a plane to the southern city of Porto Alegre, her adopted hometown. On her arrival she was greeted by more well-wishers. Hours after the impeachment vote, Ms Rousseff's vice-president Michel Temer, was sworn in, ending 13 years in power for the left-wing Workers' Party. He will serve out Ms Rousseff's term until 1 January 2019. Ms Rousseff has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the Senate's decision but correspondents say it has very little chance of succeeding.	Former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has left her official residence in the capital Brasilia for the last time following her impeachment and removal from office.
After three wickets fell in the morning, Lloyd made 102 not out, with a six and 14 fours, supported by Aneurin Donald (44) and Jacques Rudolph (38). Stu Whittingham (1-58) and Danny Briggs (2-62) were the pick of the Sussex attack on a placid pitch. The teams shook hands on a draw at 17:20 BST when Lloyd reached three figures. Sussex looked in with a strong chance when Will Bragg was run out just before lunch for 33, after nightwatchman Owen Morgan (36) had earlier been bowled by Briggs. But they took just one wicket in the afternoon, and Lloyd was dropped at slip on 66 off Whittingham when the home side took the second new ball. Sussex remain in the lower half of the table despite remaining unbeaten, with one win and seven draws. Glamorgan have been unable to win a Championship game in the first half of their season, but do have a successful limited-overs campaigns to focus on - and they will meet Sussex again, in the T20 Blast, in Cardiff on Thursday. Sussex captain Luke Wright told BBC Sussex: "It was a tough four days but I am really chuffed for the guys, particularly with the way we batted. We've not scored enough big runs, and to see the guys get big hundreds is exactly what we are looking for. "It was always going to be difficult. The wicket didn't really turn, we kept flying in and tried everything, but credit to Glamorgan for holding on tight." Glamorgan top scorer David Lloyd told BBC Wales Sport: "It was a big challenge, we lost an early wicket but the way the boys turned up today and occupied the crease was really good, so to come away with a draw is excellent. "I tried to bat time but also to bat positively as well so as not to die in a hole - the way Aneurin [Donald] played his shots, it rubbed off on myself as well so we just had to make sure it was the right ball to put away. "I didn't have a choice [about staying on for his hundred], I thought by the field that Sussex set, I had  one over to get it so that's what I tried to do. "We've had a good start in both white-ball formats and the T20 is the one we're really trying to target after the start we've had, so hopefully we can keep it going at home."	Sussex's victory bid was frustrated as David Lloyd's unbeaten hundred enabled Glamorgan to bat out the final day.
Defeats by Munster, Edinburgh and Ulster were followed by a run of nine wins in 11 Pro12 and European games, including a win against Toulon. Ospreys beat Scarlets 19-9 on Tuesday. "Hopefully it's just a glitch. We'll see next week if it's a huge step back," Owens told BBC Radio Wales. "We've bounced back well, we didn't have a great start [losing first three games] but we've built momentum. "We've got some great performances in during the international period and over the last couple of weeks." Scarlets are fifth in the Pro12 following the Ospreys defeat but Owens is optimistic about their progress this season after a poor start to their league campaign. "You can't win every game in the season and, as long as we turn up with a huge win against the Blues, then we'll be back in that winning groove again," Owens continued. "You can't go all season winning every game, it's not going to happen, so we will put ourselves in a position now from the start we had." Scott Williams says Ospreys' kicking game proved vital in the defeat and says they need to look at themselves closely before facing Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day. "We knew it was going to be close but there were too many mistakes and too many penalties," Williams said. "Our defence has been pretty good the last couple of weeks but you can't be giving penalties away when they've got boys like Dan Biggar and Sam Davies in their team. "We'll be tough on ourselves now. We've got another derby in four days so we've got to get our heads on for that and make sure we turn up."	Scarlets captain Ken Owens says they can bounce back from their derby defeat by west Wales rivals Ospreys - just like they recovered from losing their first three games of the season.

People currently get antiretroviral therapy only when their white blood cell levels drop. But a US-led study has now been cut short as early treatment was so beneficial for patients. The United Nations Aids agency has called for everyone to get immediate access to the drugs. Around 35 million people are living with HIV and more than 2 million start antiretroviral therapy each year. The discovery of drugs to attack the virus has profoundly changed the way the disease is treated. But there has been fierce debate about when treatment should start. World Health Organization guidelines say treatment should start when there are fewer than 500 white blood cells in every cubic millimetre of blood. The trial on 4,685 people in 35 countries, organised by the US National Institutes of Health, compared this approach with immediate treatment. The trial started in 2011 and was due to run until the end of 2016. But an interim analysis of the data showed that cases of Aids, deaths and complications, such as kidney or liver disease, had already been halved by early treatment. All patients on the trial are now being offered antiretroviral drugs. The director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, said: "We now have clear-cut proof that it is of significantly greater health benefit to an HIV-infected person to start antiretroviral therapy sooner rather than later. "Moreover, early therapy conveys a double benefit, not only improving the health of individuals but at the same time, by lowering their viral load, reducing the risk they will transmit HIV to others. "These findings have global implications for the treatment of HIV." Michel Sidibe, executive director of at UNAids, argued: "Every person living with HIV should have immediate access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy. "Delaying access to HIV treatment under any pretext is denying the right to health." Dr Steve Taylor, the lead HIV Consultant at the Birmingham Heartlands HIV Service, told the BBC the trial was hugely important. "Not least that they will they will change the way HIV treatment is prescribed in the UK and around the world. "Based on this study, people will be able to access treatment much earlier than currently, which is good for their own health and will reduce HIV transmission." Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "These exciting results should dramatically change the approach to treatment for people living with HIV, both in the UK and internationally."	HIV drugs should be given at the moment of diagnosis, according to a major trial that could change the way millions of people are treated.
He was a surprise choice to lead the Fifa investigation, and ruffled feathers at football's governing body. On one occasion, he turned up unannounced to interview members of the senior executive committee who had cast votes in the World Cup bids. Even before he dismissed Fifa's report as "erroneous", there were signs that he was not afraid to pick a fight with his employers. In an interview last year he said his authority was to investigate "any official, top down, for misconduct... no-one is above the ethics code". He acknowledged that he took on the investigation as an outsider. "I come into this case with no history or experience of what might have happened," he said. "I will look at the facts and my jurisdiction and make decisions on whether the ethics code was violated." In a recent talk to lawyers in London about ethics in sport, Mr Garcia said Fifa's ethic's code needed transparency and leadership - a comment seen as a thinly veiled critique of Fifa boss Sepp Blatter. He eventually quit Fifa in December 2014, saying that a "lack of leadership" at the organisation had led to his decision. Mr Garcia made his name in his native New York, serving as a federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York from 1992 to 2001 and working on a series of high-profile cases. These included the prosecution of four defendants for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, and the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He once told his daughter that his goal was "to punish people who do bad things and break the law". In March 2003 President George W Bush appointed Mr Garcia, a Republican, as assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement. The post put him in charge of more than 20,000 staff and a budget of more than $4bn. Later he moved back to New York's Southern District, serving as a US attorney from 2005-2008. There he supervised investigations into securities fraud, bringing a series of insider trading prosecutions. An investigation he led ultimately forced the resignation of Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer over a prostitution scandal. But he also took on some major international corruption and fraud cases, including the oil-for-food programme in Iraq and alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the Norwegian energy firm Statoil. He is currently a partner at private US law firm Kirkland and Ellis, and it was from here that he was chosen by Fifa in 2012 to lead the investigation into the bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. A year later he was among 18 Americans barred from entering Russia in Moscow's response to the Magnitsky List, which banned Russian officials from the US. Married to an FBI agent, he has kept largely out of the media spotlight and has not run for public office, despite speculation that he could be in a strong position to do so.	Michael Garcia, the American lawyer hired by Fifa to investigate the World Cup bidding process before criticising the organisation's summary of his own report and eventually resigning, is a former prosecutor with a history of launching corruption probes.
Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a "By Order hearing" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was "wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said "for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: "Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. "The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement." Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was "irrelevant" and "bound to fail". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the "details of the account are not correct". The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding.	A legal challenge to Alistair Carmichael's election as MP for Orkney and Shetland is to proceed.
No-one is absolutely certain it will happen, but most people I've spoken to assume it's coming. In reality, the Americans will just tell everyone what they want and when they want it. I'm told that European governments don't get much say in the matter or much notice of any changes - in fact they're watching the media and Twitter just in case it's sprung on them. Any ban would hit Heathrow the hardest. Three-quarters of UK flights to the US go from Heathrow. That's 761 planes a week, by far the most from any European airport. However, there is widespread concern that by tackling one threat, terrorism, the Americans could be fuelling another, even more serious problem. Fire. If lithium-ion batteries are damaged or short-circuited they make a hell of a bang. It could even be enough to bring down a plane. Captain John Cox is as knowledgeable as anyone you will meet when it comes to plane fires. The former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society has studied them for more than a decade and now travels the world advising operators, manufacturers and regulators. "Bunching lots of electronic devices together into the same secure box in the hold is the worst possible thing you could do," he told me. "Devices collected together will dramatically increase the ferocity of any fire." Aircraft holds do have fire extinguishers and limited oxygen, but that doesn't help when it comes to lithium battery fires. "The cargo hold extinguisher will put out the open flame but it will reignite. Lithium battery fires produce their own oxygen as a by-product of thermal runaway, and that keeps the fire going," says Mr Cox. Thermal runaway is the process whereby the fire spreads from one battery cell to the next. Once it gets going it's impossible to stop. And the more cells you have bunched together, the bigger the fire. Catching the fire early and stopping thermal runaway is critical. The best device for doing that remains an old fashioned, well-trained human being. Airline staff practise what to do: you put the battery into water if you can. Or wet towels. No-one can do that if it's in the hold. Steve Landells is the safety expert at the British Airline Pilots Association, "Given the risk of fire from these devices when they are damaged or they short circuit, an incident in the cabin would be spotted earlier and this would enable the crew to react quickly before any fire becomes uncontainable," he says. "If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports." Mr Cox says that balancing the different risks is complex and needs a thorough assessment from a range of experts. But along with many others in the industry, he's not confident that will happen. The feeling is that the people at the US Department for Homeland Security will take their decision in isolation from the safety people at the US Federation Aviation Administration. That's what happened when the current laptop ban on some flights from the Middle East was brought in. Passengers will no doubt support a ban if they are convinced it'll keep them safer. But the experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous.	Airports, airlines and the government are bracing themselves for a ban on laptops, tablets, cameras and e-readers going as hand luggage on flights between Europe and America.
Six members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg blocked the entrance to the building at Llandudno Junction at about 06:30 GMT. North Wales Police were called to the protest, which ended at midday. The Welsh government said it was taking action to promote the language. The protestors said the action was part of a general Cymdeithas campaign to put pressure on the Labour administration in Wales to act urgently for the Welsh language. They want the Welsh government to adopt six basic policy changes, including making Welsh-medium education available for all and what they call "fair funding" for the language. Robin Farrar, chairman of the society, said: "We're here to speak out for the present generation, and those to come, who should be able to live in Welsh. "There's a real crisis facing the language, but the Welsh government is not acting seriously. "We're certain that our unique national language can thrive over the years to come with positive campaigning and political will." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are very disappointed that Cymdeithas yr Iaith has decided to take this course of action, especially as we've held regular, and constructive, dialogue with the group. "Over the past year we have taken positive action to promote the Welsh language, including significant measures such as publishing proposed standards to improve Welsh language services to citizens."	Welsh language campaigners have chained themselves to the gates of Welsh government offices in a protest at a "lack of response" to the decline in the number of Welsh speakers.
With a population of fewer than 5,000, nearly one in 10 people in South Cave expressed opposition to the plans by Gladman Developments. The developer wants to build on land off Little Wold Lane. South Cave Parish Council has also objected to the proposal, saying it would cause "landscape harm" in the picturesque village. A local campaign group, Save Our Valley, is co-ordinating opposition to the development. Villagers claim the new housing would run parallel to the Wolds Way, a national walking trail, "seriously impacting" on views across the valley. Concerns have also been raised about increased flooding risk and congestion. Gladman said the development would "provide a choice of housing to meet the needs of the area, whilst respecting and enhancing the site's environmental and cultural assets". The development would include access roads and landscaping, together with a play area. The standard consultation on the proposals finishes on 7 April.	More than 600 people in an East Yorkshire village have objected to plans for 119 new homes.
Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves," he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery," Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "We only use data obtained by people we trust and know," Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the "genocide" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is "We won't forgive or forget", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: "Joseph Biden is the fascists' master." Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists "war criminals" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as "Humpty Dumpty". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Throughout the bitter violence of the Ukrainian conflict, another hidden war has been waged, involving several groups of computer hackers.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit." The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved. England: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63). France: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72). Not Used: Heymans.	England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
Paul McMullen got them underway when he finished a Billy King cross, and shortly after it was 2-0 when King scored with a long-range shot. Mark Durnan volleyed in a third to give the visitors a commanding half-time lead against the Highland League side. The result was marred with United striker James Keatings carried off. The result at Victoria Park gives Ray McKinnon's men six points out of six following the 2-0 win on Saturday over Raith Rovers.	Three first-half goals moved Dundee United three points clear at the top of Scottish League Cup Group C as they eased past Buckie Thistle.
He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be "allowed or dismissed". An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing. On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court. In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing. The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS. But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action. Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had "occasional sexual encounters" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009. They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a "three-way" with AB's partner, CD. Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter. In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story. That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication. But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales. Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban. They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter. PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now "so widespread" that confidentiality had "probably been lost", they said. The man's solicitors had been "assiduous" in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a "hopeless task".	A celebrity who wants an injunction to keep an extra-marital relationship out of the media will put his case at the Supreme Court on Thursday.
Many MPs are spending a lot of time in their constituencies preparing to contest the most closely-fought and unpredictable election in decades. As early as last year Labour taunted the government that this was a "zombie" Parliament, as much of the legislation in the coalition's programme from 2010 had already been passed. The opposition has repeated the allegation many times since. MPs on the government side have hit back with claims that Labour has given up scrutinising bills properly. But as MPs look to the final few weeks before the dissolution of the Parliament elected in 2010, there are still a few bills left to deal with. A bill to improve and strengthen the service complaints system and enable payments to be made to charities and other organisations that support the Armed Forces across the UK. The bill began in the the Lords and has passed all stages in the upper house. It is awaiting its Commons report stage at a date to be confirmed. It is likely that the third reading will also be taken on the same day. As the bill is not particularly controversial it is likely to see royal assent before Parliament is dissolved. A bill overhauling consumer rights law, covering contracts for goods, services, digital content and the law relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts. Consideration of Commons amendments in the Lords was on 24 February, so this will make it to the statute book. A bill to devolve powers to set the rate of corporation tax to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was due to have its remaining Commons stages - report stage and third reading - on 4 March. The devolution of powers to set the corporation tax rate was a key demand of political leaders ahead of the Stormont House Agreement finalised in Belfast last month. It is still to go through the Lords but the government aims to pass the law before May's general election and Labour has not opposed it. The bill makes a number of changes which would affect business generally and in particular areas including decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee. All Commons stages are complete, while its third reading in the Lords is due on 4 March. However, peers defeated the government during report stage, voting for there to be no move to decriminalise non-payment of the fee before 2017. It remains to be seen if MPs will overturn this amendment and another game of ping pong will ensue. First reading - the bill's formal introduction, in which the name of the bill is read out but no debate takes place. Second reading - a debate on the general principles of a bill. Committee stage - detailed scrutiny of the bill, either in a committee of the whole House or in a public bill committee. Report stage - consideration of the report of the bill committee and a further chance for MPs or peers to table amendments. Third reading - final consideration of the amended bill as a whole. In the House of Lords, there is a final chance to table amendments. Ping pong - if one House rejects the other's amendments, the bill goes back and forth between the lower and upper Houses until agreement is reached. A bill concerning the membership and functions of the House of Commons Commission, which is responsible for the administration and services of the House of Commons. This bill was fast-tracked through the Commons, with all stages on one day - 24 February. After that, it will need the approval of peers. This is a private members' bill, which would put into legislation a target of spending at least 0.7% of national income on aid. It has passed its Commons stages and had its report stage in the Lords on 27 February. Unlike most private members' bills, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore's bill stands a good chance of becoming law. The bill to allow women Church of England bishops to sit in the House of Lords had its committee stage in the upper House on 26 February. It sailed through its Commons stages and its second reading in the Lords. Basically, its passage is guaranteed. The first woman bishop has already been consecrated. The Right Reverend Libby Lane became Bishop of Stockport in January. The bill to give people greater flexibility in accessing their pension benefits and to help them make informed decisions about what to do with benefits is at the ping pong stage. MPs considered Lords amendments on 24 February. The bill provides for a recall petition to be triggered if an MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House for at least 21 sitting days. It is due to have its third reading in the Lords on 2 March, having passed all stages in the Commons. This bill started in the Lords and had its Commons report stage and third reading on 23 February, with the Lords due to consider any amendments made by MPs in March. This bill aims to improve access to finance for businesses and individuals and also concerns public procurement and the regulatory provisions relating to business and certain voluntary and community bodies. It has passed all stages in the Commons and has its Lords report stage on 3 March. This private bill, which applies to Transport for London and its subsidiaries, started in the House of Lords and had its Commons report stage on 26 February. Private bills are usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, rather than the government. They are distinct from private members' bills which are promoted by individual MPs or peers. And spare a thought for those that are likely to fall by the wayside. A bill which would confer powers to acquire land and to construct and operate phase one of HS2 - a high speed rail line from London to Birmingham. This is a hybrid bill, which features aspects of a public bill and a private bill. This means it is of general application but it contains provisions which have a different legal effect on the private interests of particular persons. The hybrid bill procedure gives those persons who are directly and specially affected an opportunity to petition against the bill and be heard in select committee. Following the bill's second reading it was sent to a select committee and has remained there ever since. The government has admitted that the legislation will not be passed before the general election. This is private members' bill sponsored by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi. It has passed all stages in the Lords and had its Commons second reading scheduled for 27 February, although it was too low down the day's schedule for MPs to even begin debating it. Even if the bill manages a second reading, it might struggle to progress further in the time left before Parliament dissolves. It has also faced some passionate opposition from other MPs and peers. Conservative MP Jonathan Evans' private members' bill has already completed its journey through the House of Lords and has its Commons report stage on 6 March. However, it is likely that no time will be left for a third reading.	The election is approaching fast and both Houses of Parliament have put in some short days recently.
Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed "Big Loz", said: "He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win." The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. "I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me," he said. "There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event." Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads "as many times as possible" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. "My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me," he said. "I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good."	Game of Thrones star "The Mountain" has been beaten to Europe's Strongest Man title by a man from Swindon.
The FTSE 100 index rose 77 points, or 1.1%, to 6,911.4, with similar rises seen elsewhere in Europe. Most analysts had expected the Fed to hold rates on Wednesday, although the US central bank indicated rates could rise before the end of the year. The dollar fell after US rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up. That led to rises in shares of mining companies, as the price of copper hit a one-month high and other metal prices increased. Shares in Glencore and Fresnillo led the FTSE 100 higher, with both seeing rises of more than 5%. "Given the rise across the spectrum for commodities, it comes as no surprise that the FTSE leaderboard is headed by some of the biggest names in mining," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. In the FTSE 250, shares in Kier Group rose 1.3% after the construction group reported a 45% increase in underlying full-year pre-tax profits to Â£125m. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.55% against the dollar to $1.3104, but was little changed against the euro at â‚¬1.166.	(Close): UK shares joined in the global rally triggered by the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged.
The Taiwanese firm, also known as Foxconn Technology, posted a net profit of NT$37bn ($1.2bn; Â£814m) in the October to December quarter. It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue. In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. "In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage," said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. "They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China," he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.	Hon Hai Precision Industry, a major assembler of Apple products, has posted record quarterly profits helped by growing demand for iPhones and iPads.
Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five. Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play when a throw-in found James Hurst who squared to Jake Lawlor to stroke into an empty net. Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break. The hosts, who started the second half well, levelled on 62 minutes when a slip by half-time substitute Derek Asamoah let York curl sweetly into the top-right corner from the edge of the box. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1. Second Half ends, Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1. Substitution, Guiseley. Michael Rankine replaces Jordan Preston.

Pink Mist also took the Roland Mathias poetry award. Francesca Rhydderch won the fiction prize with The Rice Paper Diaries and Meic Stephens took the creative factual award for Rhys Davies: A Writer's Life. In Welsh, Ioan Kidd won the book prize and people's choice award with his work, Dewis. Literature Wales chief executive Lleucu Siencyn said: "This is a book-loving town and local support has ensured the success of this evening. "From Japan to New Quay, Afghanistan to Bristol, Fitzrovia to Blaenclydach the 2014 winners have guided readers to near and distant lands. "Many congratulations to Meic Stephens, Francesca Rhydderch and, of course, to second time winner Owen Sheers." Sheers won the book of the year title in 2005 for his work The Dust Diaries. This year's winning book Pink Mist is about three young soldiers from Bristol who are deployed to Afghanistan. The poem looks at the effect of war on the men and those closest to them when they return from service. Sheers told BBC Radio Wales it was a "fantastic surprise" to win. "It's a book that started with around 30 interviews I did with recently wounded service personnel and their families," he said. "I actually did those interviews for a stage project called The Two Worlds of Charlie F, but when that finished I found that I still had so much more that I wanted to say and there were so many stories I hadn't been able to tell on stage, so that's when Pink Mist was born. "It was Radio 4 that approached me about writing a verse drama - sort of, I suppose, a play for voices if you like - and I asked them if I could go back to this same territory." The theme of war continued in the fiction category where Rhydderch's winning novel is set both in wartime Hong Kong and in west Wales. Stephens won the creative non-fiction category with the first full biography of one of Wales' most prolific writers, Rhys Davies. In Welsh, Kidd enjoyed a successful night with his novel Dewis, which looks at the trials and tribulations of contemporary family life. Each category winner was awarded Â£2,000, and the main award winner in each language received an additional Â£6,000.	Poet Owen Sheers has won Wales Book of the Year at a ceremony in Caernarfon for his work about three young soldiers.
Media playback is not supported on this device Bottom side United's first win in Perth in four years, and Kilmarnock's draw away to Partick Thistle, means the gap between them is down to five points. "It was a wonderful effort. With 10 men, that spirit and character was there again," said the Finn. "I can't praise the boys enough. They've got real mental toughness." Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Dow had put United into a deserved lead midway through the first half. However, Saints came back into the match and when Coll Donaldson was sent off for denying Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the visiting fans may have feared another damaging day in their bid to avoid automatic relegation. St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson hit the crossbar as the home side pressed for an equaliser but United held firm. "We still have a long way to go but that was a small step towards it," continued Paatelainen. "The mood is positive. Killie will pick up points so we need to be strong. They have a quality manager, they have fantastic players in every department, but days like this will help our chances of survival and that's what we hang on to. "I'm really pleased with everybody's effort." Saints manager Tommy Wright was frustrated at his team's lack of bite in the first quarter of the match. "Up until they scored we didn't compete well enough, didn't make enough tackles, didn't win enough first headers or second headers," he lamented. "I thought we got a slap in the face with the goal and we were much better after that. Probably they've defended well enough overall to win the game. "When you give a team something to hold on to, even with 10 men, it makes it really difficult." Alan Mannus had made two impressive saves prior to the United goal but he will have been disappointed to have allowed Dow's shot past him. "I think in the build-up to the goal we should have done better," said Wright. "We dropped too deep and we should have dealt with the cross better. He got a free contact inside the box. "Because Alan was on the move, it hit the underside of his body and squirmed over the line."	Mixu Paatelainen praised his Dundee United players' resolve as they beat St Johnstone 1-0, despite being reduced to 10 men for the last 30 minutes.
Patrick Bauer and Nathan Byrne helped Karl Robinson's men complete a perfect smash and grab, cancelling out Zach Clough's free-kick. A victory which furthers the Addicks' own play-off ambitions was made all the more impressive considering that they were a man short from the 12th minute onwards following Lewis Page's red card. After Page was sent off for a professional foul on Josh Vela, Clough then made the punishment count double with a brilliant free-kick, his ninth goal of the season. But Robinson's side refused to lie down, equalising on 23 minutes when Jake Forster-Caskey's free-kick was turned in at the far post by defender Bauer. The Addicks then grabbed a shock lead in first-half stoppage time when Forster-Caskey led an impressive counter, feeding Byrne to slot the ball under the advancing Ben Alnwick. Bolton, now without a win in their last five games in all competitions, threw all they had at Charlton after that and struck the woodwork when Andrew Taylor's cross deflected off Chris Solly. They failed to seriously test goalkeeper Declan Rudd in the second half, however, as they slipped to a second consecutive 2-1 defeat in front of their own fans. Charlton, unbeaten since Christmas, have now picked up 11 points from their last five matches to climb to 11th, just six points off a play-off place. Report supplied by the Press Association.	Charlton Athletic came from behind with 10 men to deliver a blow to Bolton Wanderers' League One promotion hopes  at the Macron Stadium.
The Tennis Integrity Unit said Lindahl plotted to throw a match at a minor Australian tournament in 2013. Two other Australian players, Brandon Walkin and Isaac Frost, were also disciplined over the incident. It comes days after Australian Open junior champion Oliver Anderson was charged with match-fixing. Last year, a joint BBC/Buzzfeed investigation alleged the TIU failed to act on suspicions that 16 top-50 ranked players have been involved in match-fixing. Lindahl, 28, achieved a career-high ranking of 187 in singles before retiring in 2013. The TIU, which is responsible for policing tennis, said the offence happened at the Australian F6 Tournament in Toowoomba, Queensland. "He was found guilty of charges of contriving or attempting to contrive the outcome of an event, and failing to co-operate with a TIU investigation," it said in a statement. The penalty means Lindahl will not be able to resume his international playing career or attend official tennis events for seven years, the TIU said. He had already been fined A$1,000 by a court in New South Wales last year. Walkin, 22, was handed a six-month suspension for "passing a corrupt proposal to another party" on behalf of Lindahl. But the 1,066-ranked player is free to compete after his penalty was suspended for six months, subject to further breaches. Frost, 28 and ranked 1,515, refused to hand over his mobile phone during the investigation. He will not be further penalised after serving a provisional suspension between October 2013 and September 2014.	Australian former tennis player Nick Lindahl has been banned for seven years and fined $35,000 (Â£28,000; A$47,700) for match-fixing.
Homeowners hit by the flooding in December can apply for up to Â£5,000 from the government's Future Flood Prevention Funding scheme. Figures seen by the BBC show that only 13 people have applied for the money. Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, said she had received complaints about accessing the fund. "The form filling is incredibly complicated and that's where people have been struggling," she said. "It's putting off a lot on people." Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded in the city after the Rivers Foss and Ouse burst their banks. The scheme is administered by City of York Council and requires a survey to be carried out on the flooded property before funding can be applied for. The council said that 360 private homes were eligible for the grant. The authority added: "We very much welcome grant applications but know that this can take time while people wait for quotes and loss adjustor reports. "We're appointing a case worker to help residents and businesses through the application process."	York residents are being put off applying for flood protection grants as the process is "incredibly complicated", a local MP has claimed.
PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses. Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey. The company said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties. Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain. A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: "The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability." Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had "responded speedily and positively" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions. He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's "world class facilities and workforce". Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries. That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe. Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable. PSA said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall. A spokesman said: "Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK. "This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities." David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward. "I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit," he said. "So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain. "And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."	Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed to meet the head of France's PSA Group to discuss its planned takeover of Vauxhall in the UK.
The train firm said it would refund the difference in cost between mainline and high speed fares - to compensate for the loss of direct high speed trains. Southeastern will also give season ticket-holders from five stations a backdated 20% refund on mainline fares. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, said the line still needed repairing quickly. He said it had been a difficult time for rail users and it was right passengers should be compensated after the problems were caused when cracks appeared in the sea wall. Mr Elphicke said an emergency peak-time high-speed rail service between Dover and St Pancras to help commuters had made a difference. "We now need Network Rail to confirm how long it will take to repair the sea wall," he said. Steve Kilby, from Network Rail, said the team was working hard to get a final design in place for repairs. But, he said: "This week has been very stormy on the beach and our guys have been working through tough conditions." He said 15,000 tonnes of rock had been placed on the shingle to protect the railway from heavy seas and eventually more than 70,000 tonnes would be in place. The stations where passengers will be compensated are Sandwich, Deal, Walmer, Martin Mill and Dover Priory. Compensation claim forms are available for people at the station.	Passengers affected by the collapse of a railway line during storms in Dover are to be compensated, rail operator Southeastern has said.
The FBI has ordered Apple to disable the security software on a dead murderer's iPhone but the tech giant has refused. Mark Zuckerberg said he did not believe the authorities should have backdoors to bypass encryption protection. However, a lawyer representing some of the gunman's victims has backed the federal bureau. Stephen Larson, a former judge, said he intended to file legal paperwork next month telling Apple to co-operate. "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," he added. He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee. Mr Zuckerberg made his comments at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. "I don't think that requiring back doors to encryption is either going to be an effective thing to increase security or is really the right thing to do," he said. "We are pretty sympathetic to Tim [Cook] and Apple." He added that Facebook was committed to doing all it could to prevent terrorism but his company was in favour of encryption. The social network had previously issued a statement saying that the court order could create a "chilling precedent". Leaders at Google and Twitter also voiced support for Apple last week. Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in California last December. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the FBI's order as "dangerous" and "unprecedented". He has said the firm would have to build a new operating system in order to comply. "We strongly believe the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it," the firm stated in a Q&A on the Apple website. In a statement published on Sunday, the FBI Director James Comey said the demand was "about the victims and justice". "We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly," the FBI director wrote. "That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land. "Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead." Last week anti-virus creator John McAfee offered to unlock the iPhone for the FBI. "It will take us three weeks," he told Business Insider, adding that he would eat his shoe on television if his team failed.	Facebook's chief executive has said he is sympathetic to Apple's position in its clash with the FBI.
Archaeologists are racing against changing tides to record and excavate the find in peat at Borth, which gives a snapshot of a time when the shore lay further west. The team believes the footprints could be 3,000 to 4,000 years old. Staff and students from the University of Wales Trinity St David are carrying out the work. As well as the footprints, a line of post holes has been found, which could have been a causeway. They lie across an area that would have been salt marsh when the footprints were made. The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments is providing survey support, mapping the extent of the peat and other exposed features. Submerged forests have been found further north on the beach and nearby in the past. Dr Martin Bates is one of the archaeologists leading the excavation team, and it was his father, retired geologist Denis Bates, who discovered the footprints last month. Dr Bates told BBC Wales' news website: "My father has had an interest in submerged forests for many years. "He was down in February as this part of the beach was very clear. "For various reasons the patterns of sand movement have been temporarily altered and it means this area of beach has been stripped of sand. "He noticed the marks and told me they didn't look natural." He estimates they have a window of a few months to log the discoveries and take samples away for environmental testing before the sands shift again and cover the footprints up. "In the context of Ceredigion and west Wales, it's the first time we have found this type of evidence. "The submerged forests [nearby] are probably the most significant in the UK. "What we have never had before is documented evidence of human habitation." 'Quite special' Dr Bates added that there were a range of footprints discovered, including cattle, sheep or goat and possibly a bear. However the one which resonates with him is a print which belonged to a young child. "We have got a footprint of a four-year-old's foot where we can see the toes and everything. "I can stand where this child was standing about 4,000 years ago and even though we would have been seeing different things, the intimacy of that is quite special." Work in previous years on submerged forests found on the area to the north has established that a forest was growing in the area between 3000 and 2500 BC. The area was gradually waterlogged with peat growth. A number of finds in the area included a Mesolithic composite tool of antler, two flints, an auroch (extinct ox) skeleton and a piece of antler.	Human and animal fossilised footprints that may be from the Bronze Age have been exposed on a Ceredigion beach.
The 34-year-old has been absent from the club since a training-ground row after the 5-1 Scottish Premiership loss at Celtic on 10 September. Alongside agent Eddy Jennings, he attended a meeting with club officials last week. Barton, who joined from Burnley in May, has repeatedly said he wants to return and fight for his Rangers place. "Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," read a statement on Rangers' website. "The Auchenhowie [training base] management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player. "Neither the club, nor the player, will comment further." Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules. He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player, who has one England cap, left Burnley under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year contract at Ibrox. He has made eight appearances for Mark Warburton's side, who are second in the Premiership. Barton was not available for comment but said earlier on Wednesday on Twitter that it was "a lovely day for a @Iceman_Hof session and a run!" in reference to Dutch ice bath training guru Wim Hof. BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson The fact that Joey Barton is returning to full-time training does not necessarily mean the resumption of his Rangers career. Under Fifa rules, a player under contract at a club must be provided with training facilities. The fact that the player was suspended reflects the view of the management team about the serious nature of a training-ground row in September. Any return to the first-team squad would need to be handled in such a way as to not disrupt the mood and unity among the players. Rangers' statement does not say that Barton is returning to the first-team squad, or will be available for selection, and only the management team at their Auchinhowie training base is mentioned, rather than first-team manager Mark Warburton. Either the player does eventually return to the first-team squad, or his Rangers career effectively remains over and what happens in the January transfer window will be significant.	Rangers say midfielder Joey Barton "will return to full-time training" following a club-imposed suspension.
Aged 19, Jack Evans is working in one of the country's oldest and most nostalgic industries - the steam railway. "It's always different, the weather's always different, you're always on with different people," he said. "I'm interested in engineering, I'm studying engineering at university at the moment and being here, it just ticks all the boxes for what I want to do later on." He works alongside Jac Smith, who recently passed his steam engine driving test on his 21st birthday - making him one of the youngest in the job in the UK. Although the Vale of Rheidol line no longer carries lead ore from the mines, as it did between 1902 and the 1930s, it does carry tourists from the seaside town of Aberystwyth to nearby Devil's Bridge. Its workshop, near Aberystwyth railway station, restores locomotives for museums and railways across the UK - and has recently been commissioned to create new wheels for the town's cliff railway which takes visitors up Constitution Hill. "These are the sort of things you can't learn in college, you have to learn on the job," Will Smith, operations and safety officer, said. "So you'll find the railway itself is operated by quite a young staff, so it bucks the trend for the tourist railways and safeguards it for the next generation. "It's an interesting place to work, no two days are the same. You get to meet thousands of interesting visitors and everybody's here to have a good day out." Mr Smith said since 1902 the railway, which has always included a passenger service, had only stopped operating once - during World War Two. "Pretty much everything in the country shut down," he said. "As part of the war effort it stopped operation, but I'm told the day the war ended they steamed the engine up and blew the whistle all the way down the line. "Someone said that was their first memory of the railway." Simon Cowan, carriage and locomotive painter, is trained as a fireman and a driver. "The main thing is to make things from scratch, to replace items which are no longer made," he said. "So we copy them faithfully and make them all in the old fashioned way and then I pass these skills on to other people, it's a bit like a big museum. "It's the older people, I'm one of them, who have grown up in that specialist knowledge, that area, passing those skills on - because I will get to the point where I can't do this any more. "I show people how to paint, it's a lovely way of seeing people develop, so when I go on holiday I'm not thinking 'gosh what are they doing to my paint shop'. "We also put them out on the trains as firemen and guards, and we teach them as much as we can. "Carriages are painted with 24 carat gold leaf and they go 'wow that must be so expensive', well no it's so wafer thin. "We show them how to make a tracing of a word and get the typeface correct and show them how to apply the lettering on to a piece of wood, and then we'll use this varnish and paint that on to there, and when the varnish is sticky put the gold leaf on and peel it off and 'wow, that's great'. "Then I'll say 'give us your thumb' and put a bit of varnish on, just let that dry, and gold leaf their thumb and they think it's hilarious - but then they've learnt how to do it. It's really fun." Mr Cowan added because the carriages dated back to the 1920s and 30s, work had been going into improving disability access - with a new platform planned. And a great deal of work has to go into maintaining the locomotives and the 12 miles of track. Mr Smith said: "With steam railways, the equipment we use is very bespoke. "You can't get the parts off the shelf, so you make them yourself... it's very specialist and it's good to keep the skills in the local area. "The last few years we've built a really renowned workshop and that allows us not only to do our own work but also take on work for other businesses, other railways." He added: "In the far end of the workshop there's a cattle van which is coming together which was supplied new to us in the 1920s. "There were stories of livestock going up to Devil's Bridge in wagons, so they decided to build two cattle vans but unfortunately it was a bit too late for the demand - most livestock was going by road by then. "So they became redundant and the vehicle went to another railway and more recently it's come back to us and our job is to restore it back to how it would have been."	"When I tell people I'm a fireman, they think I put out fires and I've got to tell them I make them instead!"
The owner was forced to open the crocodile farm's gates on Sunday to prevent a storm surge, the local Beeld newspaper says. Many of the crocodiles have been recaptured, but more than half are still on the loose, it says. The floods have killed at least 10 people in Limpopo province. The crocodiles escaped from the Rakwena Crocodile Farm, a tourist site about 15km (nine miles) from the small town of Pontdrif, which borders Botswana. Zane Langman, the son-in-law of the farm's owner, told the newspaper that many of the crocodiles had escaped into dense bush and the Limpopo River, the second biggest in South Africa. "There used to be only a few crocodiles in the Limpopo River. Now there are a lot. We go to catch them as soon as farmers call us to inform us about crocodiles," said Mr Langman. "I heard there were crocodiles in Musina [about 120km away] on the school's rugby field." Mr Langman said he went to rescue friends in a flooded house in the area by boat on Sunday. "When we reached them, the crocodiles were swimming around them. Praise the Lord, they were all alive," he is quoted as saying. The South African Air Force is being used to rescue people affected by the flooding in remote settlements, some of which are cut off from the outside world. The floods have also affected neighbouring Mozambique, where tens of  thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes.	About 15,000 crocodiles have reportedly escaped from a farm in South Africa's far north amid heavy rains and flooding.
Englishwoman Evans, 29, is a 10-time ladies' champion. Doherty, 45, won the tournament in 1997, but the world number 43 has not reached the third round since 2006. The winner must make it through two more qualifying rounds to reach the main draw, which starts on 18 April. The tournament has increased this year from 128 to 144 players. The top 16 seeds automatically qualify for the first round, with all non-seeded players starting in the first of three qualifying rounds which run from 8-15 April. Evans received an invitation to the qualifying draw from snooker's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Six-time world champion Steve Davis is also attempting to qualify. He faces Jamie Cope in the first round of qualifying. Jimmy White, six times a runner-up at the Crucible, meets Thailand's James Wattana, while 2006 world champion Graeme Dott has been drawn against Mark Owens. Defending champion Mark Selby is the top seed, with five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan seeded second - the two met in last year's final.	Reanne Evans will face former world champion Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying as she bids to become the first woman to appear in the main stages of the World Championship.
Blair Turgott got on the end of a good passing move to secure victory in the dying minutes at Grange Lane. The Villagers' problem this season has not been creating chances but taking them, as when Steve Brogan curled in a shot from long range that clipped the bar. After the break, Reece Thompson eventually put the home side ahead with a great finish from Kyle Wootton's cross. However, Bromley substitute George Porter equalised swiftly from close range with his first touch of the match. Turgott's late winner left the bottom club quizzical about when their wretched luck will turn. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, North Ferriby United 1, Bromley 2.

The search giant's all-important advertising revenue was also up 11%, to $16bn. In a statement Google's finance chief Ruth Porat highlighted ad growth on mobile and YouTube. Google's shares jumped 7.5% in after-market trading as traders welcomed the better-than-expected results. The share price had already risen 3.5% during normal trading hours. Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of their ads. "Cost per click", or the average price of online ads, fell in the quarter, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes. Google's ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose advertising rates tend to be lower. Google's share price rise "is reflecting the fact that they've effectively just beat earnings for the first time in several quarters," said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital.	Google's net income rose 17% to $3.93bn in the three months to June from the quarter last year, boosted by an 11% rise in revenues to $17.7bn.
The Care Inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland looked at services provided by NHS Western Isles and local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. The watchdogs said there were "weaknesses" and "crucial areas for improvement" in the services. They acknowledged that care provision was "performing well in some aspects". The comhairle and health board provide the services as a partnership. A new report on the inspection carried out in April and June last year includes 12 recommendations for improvements. The inspectors said in the report that too many older people were subject to delayed discharge from hospital, and were having to wait too long for care-at-home support or a care home placement. They also identified "very limited" development of intermediate care services and said there was a need for "timely diagnosis" of dementia. Inspectors also flagged up where the health board and council have been working well. Front line health and social work staff were "well motivated and worked well together", said the report. There was also a "strong sense of community spirit" among staff and patients. Karen Reid, chief executive of the Care Inspectorate, said: "This report has highlighted important weaknesses in services provided for older people across the Western Isles, and we have clearly laid out our recommendations as to how these should be addressed. "In particular, effective and consistent leadership is needed to ensure that services deliver better outcomes for older people who access them, and for their families and carers. "We require significant improvement to ensure high-quality care is provided to older people in a way which reflects their needs and promotes their rights. "The Care Inspectorate will now work with Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Scottish government's chief social work adviser to directly support improvement in the partnership." Robbie Pearson, acting chief executive of Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: "In this joint inspection we found that most of the older people and carers that we met were generally happy with the services provided to them in the Western Isles. "They felt that the services contributed to better outcomes in respect of their health and wellbeing. We also saw good examples of older people being supported to remain in their own homes. "However, we found a number of important weaknesses that need to be addressed. A significant proportion of older people were subject to delayed discharges from hospital - this issue was raised in a previous inspection for the care of older people by Healthcare Improvement Scotland." He added: "We are confident that the recommendations set out in this report will result in significant improvements in the care that older people receive."	A joint inspection of the delivery of services for older people in the Western Isles has identified the need for improvement.
The fire raged across the city from 2 to 5 September 1666, destroying more than 13,000 houses and 87 churches. The stamps are designed by comic book artist John Higgins, who has used a graphic novel style of illustration. They feature scenes from the start, spread and aftermath of the Great Fire, using a street map design. Higgins has contributed to titles such as Judge Dredd and 2000 AD. Philip Parker, from Royal Mail, said: "Despite the terrible devastation caused by the Great Fire, it provided the opportunity for the regeneration of large swathes of the city and shaped the London we know today. "It was the catalyst of the building of iconic landmarks such as St Paul's Cathedral and dozens of parish churches. "It is fitting that we mark the anniversary of the fire with an innovative set of stamps that re-imagine the events."	The 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London is being commemorated with a set of six new stamps.
Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time. United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was sent off in 55 minutes after collecting a second yellow card. Rudi Skacel struck the bar for Raith but neither side could find the net. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon is desperate to add more of a goal threat to his team and Dutch trialist striker Felitciano Zschusschen watched from the stands. The Tangerines struggled to make clear cut chances but with 15 minutes to go Scott Fraser went down in the box as he tried to go between Jean Yves M'Voto and Kyle Benedictus. Cuthbert produced an impressive save to deny Norwich City's on-loan striker Andreu to ensure the points were shared. Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "It was a great save from Kevin but he shouldn't have had to make it. It was a poor decision. "I'm not one that likes to go about these things as the referees have got a hard job and it's not something I want to talk about too much but it was a soft, soft decision. "It was great that he saved it though as we wouldn't have deserved to get beat in that game." Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I'm so proud of the players today as I thought we were the better team for the entire 90 minutes and even when we were down to ten men we were excellent. "We created a few chances but there will be twists and turns in this league all season and we have lots of positives to take forward. "To get a point against a tough team like Raith with just ten men was absolutely outstanding and if you had said to us three months ago we would be up at the top of the league we would have taken that." Match ends, Raith Rovers 0, Dundee United 0. Second Half ends, Raith Rovers 0, Dundee United 0. Attempt missed.

"The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country," said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would exercise congressional functions. The charge stems from alleged electoral irregularities by three opposition lawmakers in elections in 2015. The head of the OAS Luis Almagro accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of carrying out what he described as a coup against itself. Brazil's foreign ministry said the court's decision violated the country's separation of powers. Several other Latin American countries expressed concern too. Peru recalled its ambassador to Caracas, saying there had been a rupture of democracy. The United States also condemned Venezuela's government. "This rupture of democratic and constitutional norms greatly damages Venezuela's democratic institutions," said a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner. Venezuela's opposition had earlier said President Maduro was becoming a dictator. Venezuela's foreign ministry accused critics of the government of forming a right-wing regional pact against President Maduro. He says the OAS is a pawn of US "imperialism".	There has been growing criticism of Venezuela's government after the Supreme Court took over legislative powers from the National Assembly.
Media playback is not supported on this device And this isn't a sentence from the early 1980s. At Swansea there's a new Toshack in town these days. Cameron, son of former boss John, helps coach an under-23 side having an impressive season. On Tuesday night they played in the quarter finals of the Checkatrade Trophy but were beaten on penalties by Coventry City. The Checkatrade Trophy is tournament much-maligned this season, but Swansea's youngsters beat three league sides to get so far and were the only Premier League academy side to reach the quarter finals. But there are still three sides they could win this season and Cameron hopes it's just the start of another successful Toshack career. "The next step for me would be to work in a first team environment," he told BBC Wales Sport. "Hopefully that's not too far away." Few can claim to have had the same success at home and abroad as John Toshack. His managerial CV includes Swansea, Wales, Real Madrid and even a league title in Morocco last year. Toshack Jr worked alongside his father when he coached in Macedonia five years ago, but now he's ready to make his own reputation. "It can be a help and a hindrance (being John Toshack's son)," he admits. "Obviously I'm very proud of what my father has achieved over the years. He's one of the most successful British managers ever. "It's great for me to have that experience on the end of a phone. I speak to him regularly and he watches the progress of our team. "But I'm not looking to emulate or be somebody else. I'm Cameron Toshack and I'm my own man." Aside from the name, there aren't too many similarities. Toshack Senior was a disciplinarian who didn't suffer fools. In his own words, his son is much more analytical. "He's a learned type - a little bit too much for me," he jokes. "All this analysis that goes into the game is now is a bit beyond me. But he's very, very conscientious and always looking to learn. "Hopefully the Swans will get the benefit of it." Of course transferring success with a youth team to success as a head coach is easier said than done. But Cameron Toshack only has to look at Swansea's new head coach for inspiration. Paul Clement started his career as a coach in Chelsea's academy, before his promotion to assistant manager under Carlo Ancelotti. Toshack is working towards his Pro Licence and is the first person at Swansea to complete the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme. He feels he's almost ready to make the step up. "Without getting ahead of myself, I'd like to eventually be in and around the first team here - and if it's not here maybe at another club somewhere in Europe," he says. "I'd like to follow in my father's footsteps in that respect. I'm not averse to moving to other countries to learn my trade and be a success."	Toshack's Swansea side have won 16 out of their last 19 and are top of their division with a chance in the cup.
HS2 Action Alliance says a paper by HS2 Ltd shows engineering work will mean closing parts of some passenger lines for 133 weekends, and some freight lines for 50 weekends. It would also mean 19 weekend closures at Euston station, the group said. HS2 said any closures would be carefully planned. On the Derby to Birmingham lines for example, the document says 32 weekends will be hit between 2017 and 2022, 13 of them for just a day and 19 for the entire weekend.  The CrossCountry rail firm and freight services would both be affected. For the Coventry to Leamington Spa route, it says four whole weekends will be lost in 2018, with passengers asked to catch a replacement bus instead. Part of the busy West Coast Mainline will close for 31 weekends in 2018-19, as they build a new flyover junction in the Handsacre area, with trains diverted via Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Richard Houghton from HS2 Action Alliance said: "It is clear that once again HS2 is being less than honest with the travelling public. It is planning a huge number of weekend closures which will impact the travelling public. "Combined with this its arrogance continues. It is planning to issue Â£7bn of supplier contracts before the Hybrid Bill passes through Parliament and now we discover it will start closing Euston before they have the legal go-ahead for the new line." The document does say that the number and length of the closures are just estimates at the moment, and that work will be tied in with everyday engineering projects wherever possible, to minimise disruption. But it does warn that "HS2 phase one will need to recognise the cumulative effect on passengers and operators of disruption". Train operators could also be compensated for the impact on their services. HS2 Ltd spokesman David Meechan said: "Our railways are becoming increasingly crowded.  Britain desperately needs this new high speed rail network to boost rail capacity and improve links between our biggest cities. "There will be times when construction impacts on the current railway, but this will be carefully planned with Network Rail and the train operators. "HS2 Ltd will do all it can to minimise disruption to passengers.  Compensation to the train operators for any such disruption will be drawn from the existing budget for the HS2 project." Two years ago a government commissioned report said that the alternative to building HS2, basically beefing up what is already there, would cause 14 years worth of weekend problems across the network.	Building the proposed new High Speed Two (HS2) rail line will mean years of weekend "misery" for rail passengers, according to a campaign group.
Craig Nelson, who was also known as Craig Preston, was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire at 11:00 BST on Monday. A post-mortem found the 34-year-old from Wath-Upon-Dearn in Rotherham died as a result of head injuries. A man, 41, and a woman, 23, were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police and remain in custody.	Police have arrested two people on suspicion of murder after a man's body was found on moorland.

Work was due to begin this week on demolishing Prestatyn Community Hospital which closed two years ago. But now National Resources Wales has ruled that because seagulls are nesting on the roof, the demolition must be put on hold until the chicks have  flown. Developers Pure Residential and Commercial have bought the site and lodged plans for apartments and houses.	Seagulls have come to the aid of campaigners fighting to save a former hospital from immediate demolition.
Premier had suspended its shares on 13 January after agreeing to buy E.On's North Sea assets for a net $120m (Â£84m) plus working capital adjustments. The deal was amended during the suspension so that it no longer constituted a reverse takeover. By close of trading, Premier's share price was up by nearly 90% to 36p. London-based Premier said the cost of the deal would now come to $135m, including completion adjustments. Premier added that this was a result of an increase of the dividend paid to E.On before completion of the deal. In a statement, it said: "On the basis of this lower aggregate consideration, the acquisition has been classified as a Class 1 transaction." The proposed acquisition is still subject to approval by Premier's shareholders and lenders. The assets Premier is buying are located in the Central North Sea, West of Shetlands and the Southern Gas Basin. E.On's UK oil and gas upstream portfolio includes stakes in 40 licenses, including a 5.2% interest in the Elgin-Franklin field, a 47% interest in the Babbage field and a 50% stake in the Tolmount discovery. The deal will add about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to Premier's production totals in 2016, according to the company.	Premier Oil's shares nearly doubled in value on Monday after trading was restarted following a suspension triggered by a major North Sea deal.
He had an initial spell with the Vikings between 2008 and 2013 and was named one of its 50 greatest players. Defensive end Allen, 34, last played for the Carolina Panthers in 2015 and also had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago Bears. "We are proud to have Jared retire as a member of the Vikings franchise," said Vikings owner Zygi Wilf.	Jared Allen will retire as a Minnesota Vikings player after he signed a one-day deal with the NFL team on Thursday.
Old hands at the book club game are husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan and Oprah. Their clubs began on TV but the new breed has, from the off, been virtual - online and on apps. And the main players are almost exclusively female, including Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Florence Welch, Zoella and Sarah Jessica Parker, as are the clubs' members. It would be easy to be cynical about this new trend but it has its merits, says Claire Armitstead, associate editor for culture at the Guardian. "These celebrities want to show they are intelligent people and not just celebrities, that's perhaps their motive for it. "But what they bring is their brand. There are so many books in the world that any kind of 'sorting hat', to use a Harry Potter term, is a good thing for reading." Debut writer Caz Frear knows the benefit of star endorsement. This week she sees her first novel, crime thriller Sweet Little Lies, hit the shelves after winning Richard and Judy's second Search for a Bestseller competition.  She says it was the couple's name that encouraged her to enter. "It was the possibility of their validation, they are huge names in the literary world. You think, if they like it then I must have something. There were other competitions that weren't small fry but I wanted to put myself in the strongest position." The Richard and Judy club has grown into a polished brand  in collaboration with high-street chain WH Smith since starting on the couple's Channel 4 chat show in the early 2000s. Now only online (and in stores), it is more successful, says Madeley. "I knew it would be fine, we are a brand and, in fact, we're selling more books than before... the internet is king. Books are submitted for consideration by publishers, which inevitably leads to recurring well-known names. But the final selections - issued three times a year - are made on quality alone, says Madelely. "We choose a lot of established names, yes, but it's entirely on merit. We love finding new talent like Caz... you need fresh blood all the time... books are the stuff of life." If he and Finnigan keep an eye on the new celebrity clubs, it's from an interested, not competitive, stance. "We're all out there to get people reading," says Madeley. A recent survey by The Reading Agency showed two thirds of people would like to read more but are too busy. Yet, the agency's chief executive supports Armitstead's "sorting hat" theory: "Most people also said they struggled to find a book they liked. Recommendations are the most likely thing to convince people to read more literature... however they are signposted to books, it can only be a good thing," says Sue Wilkinson. Harry Potter star Emma Watson points her followers towards powerful feminist literature through her club Our Shared Shelf (OSS) on the Good Reads website. She is also active on Instagram. Watson launched OSS in 2016 following her appointment as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and her HeForShe speech. Every two months she selects a book for her 193,000-plus members to absorb and discuss. Selections have included Gloria Steinem's My Life on the Road and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale - now enjoying renewed interest possibly due to a heady combination of a Channel 4 dramatisation, Watson's endorsement and the topicality of its issues. Watson's enterprise is clearly serious and she's left books for others to find on the London and New York undergrounds. "Emma Watson with her feminist classics is placing herself as a young thinking woman but doing it through her position as a UN ambassador is quite structured," says Armitstead. "Similarly, if someone wants to project themselves as a fun person they are going to choose fun books. "Emma Watson will have people advising her, probably in order to push the kind of books the organisation thinks people should be reading. "It is a good thing for a woman to read Gloria Steinem but has Emma Watson?" Relaxed and seemingly without agenda is Florence Welch's Between Two Books on Twitter.  Her fan website also promotes the club. It was established by Welch enthusiasts in dedication of her love of reading, demonstrated in her regular online posts about books. She got involved at their invitation. Welch suggests a wide range of literature, from Eimear McBride's The Lesser Bohemian to the poetry of Ted Hughes. She also involves her music mates, so that Nick Cave and Bat for Lashes have flagged up choices. Welch dips in and out of the 11,000-plus members' discussions and even offers the chance to meet her, authors and each other at book events such as the Borris Festival. Unlike some other clubs which are more inclined towards just showcasing the star's reading, Watson and Welch's are clubs in the traditional sense. They allow like-minded people "to get together" (literally in Welch's case) and talk. And the fans love it. "The club (Between Two Books) is for fans and managed by fans, ordinary, lovely and like-minded people," says one ardent fan, Kawanna Pena Cepeda, from the Dominican Republic. "It makes it more approachable and grounded. It doesn't have any 'agenda'... other than share amazing literature that our queen, Florence, loves. "It's an amazing way to connect with other Flo fans other than by her music. It's exciting to think the book you are currently reading, Florence is reading as well... it feels like we are connected." Similarly, Maritza Jimenez in Chicago, Illinois says she joined OSS "because I really admire Emma Watson". "To have that instant connection (however small) feels really good. Then, I put some serious thought into what she's trying to do... open up a discussion on women's issues... it's a complex topic to tackle because it is a very human issue." Authors and the book industry are also reaping benefits from this endorsement. "Steinem's My Life on the Road, Emma Watson's first title, had a 200% boost week on week in the UK for the second week of January 2016, from 138 copies to 415," says Lisa Campbell of the Bookseller. And a true powerhouse in driving author interest, and sales is Reese Witherspoon.  The actress has become "a champion of female fiction writers", says Isabelle Broom, book reviews editor at Heat magazine. Her book club is on Instagram, with 71,000-plus followers. She also talks books on Twitter. And, she has an eye for a story which is prime for movie adaptation and is quick to buy the rights through her production company, such as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Broom describes the actress as a "positive force of good" and authors are effusive too, among them Jessica Knoll, writer of Luckiest Girl Alive. "[Witherspoon's] support has immensely boosted Luckiest Girl Alive's visibility and sales," says Knoll. "It was featured in a lot of traditional media and that definitely had a cumulative impact, but when Reese featured my book... I noticed an immediate and enormous uptick in my Amazon ranking. The Zoella Book Club, also supported by WH Smith and just relaunched for 2017, has also had industry impact - and on teenage girls. With a recent National Literacy Trust study suggesting reading for pleasure falls after primary school years, the club helmed by 27-year-old Zoe Sugg - the fashion and beauty YouTube vlogger known as Zoella - is arguably a good thing. Author Alex Bell's Frozen Charlotte was chosen for Zoella's 2016 crop of reads and she says "it meant the book was able to reach a much wider audience than it would otherwise". "Zoella's book club is particularly worthwhile because it helps get teenagers excited about books and reading for pleasure, which is a wonderful thing," she adds. Zoella and the other female star book-clubbers demonstrate the trend for reading groups in the real world to be mostly (90%) made up of women, according to Sue Wilkinson at the Reading Agency. Heat's Isabelle Broom suggests this is because "women like to feel part of something, and lots of us like to feel validated, too... Plus, us girls LOVE to chat". But, while the reason needs further investigation, says Wilkinson, what is clear is that "real" book clubs - in libraries, homes and pubs - are still a big deal, and the agency has more than 4,000 in its reading groups network. And what of the future of the virtual celebrity club? "They have a shelf-life and people like Emma Watson will get bored and start looking for the next new thing," says Claire Armitstead. "But someone else will come along. There's no end of people who want to hitch their wagon to the star of reading." Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The Commons Public Accounts Committee said whistleblowers had often been subjected to bullying and harassment. Its report called for whistleblowers to be offered legal and counselling help and for "swift sanctions" to be imposed on staff who victimised them. The government said it was acting to ensure people felt free to speak out. The report highlighted the "important" role whistleblowers had played in uncovering details about the Hillsborough disaster and the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust scandal. The committee said whistleblowing was a "crucial source of intelligence to help government identify wrongdoing". However, it found there had been a "startling disconnect" between policies encouraging whistleblowers in theory and what happened in practice. The report said it had "heard of too many cases of appalling treatment of whistleblowers by their colleagues". Officials who tried to raise concerns often had to show "remarkable courage" in coming forward. The report highlighted whistleblowing in relation to the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final lost their lives. Prime Minister David Cameron later apologised for the "double injustice" of the disaster, after an independent report published in 2012 showed police and emergency services had attempted to deflect the blame. It also highlighted the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal, where staff at Stafford Hospital had blown the whistle on "appalling care" between 2005 and 2008. The committee heard from Kay Sheldon, a member of the board of the Care Quality Commission who, the report said, had been "victimised" by senior officials after she tried to raise concerns about the way it had been operating. The report said no-one had faced any form of sanction over her treatment. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, said whistleblowing was "crucial" and must be taken seriously by all chief executives of major companies and public sector organisations. She said protection for whistleblowers was still not adequate, citing the example of Osita Mba - a former lawyer at Revenue and Customs who drew attention to what he claimed were "sweetheart deals" between the tax authorities and Goldman Sachs. She said Mr Mba was a "really brave guy" but it had become "impossible for him" to remain with the organisation after his disclosures and he had had "to start his life again elsewhere". "The way you support whistleblowers is hugely important," she added. "I think it is really important that there are proper sanctions in place in an organisation so if someone does blow the whistle, they are properly supported and if anyone dares bully or harass them, they are not only reprimanded but punished." Legal protections for whistleblowers The 1998 Public Disclosure Act protects workers who disclose information about potential criminal behaviour and other malpractice at their workplace, or former workplace, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on the nature of information disclosed and who it is confided to, a whistleblower is legally protected from suffering from any detriment as a result. If these conditions are not met, a disclosure may constitute a breach of the worker's duty of confidence to his employer. The laws apply to direct employees and agency workers but not those working for the security services, and campaign group Public Concern at Work says other individuals - such as volunteers and interns - are also excluded. The law was amended last year to include a specific public interest test, whereby whistleblowers have to "reasonably believe" that their actions are in the public interest to be protected. Workers who raise concerns about bullying and harassment by work colleagues are also protected. Colleagues who victimise them are personally liable for their actions while their employers are  "vicariously liable". The Taxpayers' Alliance said the report suggested there was a "culture of secrecy" in much of the public sector and whistleblowing must be encouraged. "Though the practice often asks tough questions, it is a crucial tool to increase the accountability of those in charge and to ensure our public services work as well as possible for the people who need them," the campaign group's chief executive Jonathan Isaby said. A government spokeswoman said: "All civil servants must be able to raise concerns so that poor services and inefficient operations can be identified and acted upon. "That is why this government is ensuring people feel free to speak out. Awareness of how to raise a complaint has risen by 20% and two-thirds of civil servants feel that any complaint will be investigated properly. "In addition, we are ensuring that all departments have a clear whistleblowing policy." Labour said whistleblowing had led, in many cases, to major changes in policy. "There must be a clear standardised policy for handling whistleblowers working across all of our public services to ensure that there are no disparities in how people are dealt with, and that staff are protected from being victimised." said shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher.	The treatment of employees in public services who have raised concerns about wrongdoing has often been "shocking", a group of MPs has said.
Nine families have been resettled in Aberdeenshire in the past few weeks. Faith groups and the North East Scotland Credit Union (Nescu) have set up an account to allow people to donate money for essential items. Rev Stella Campbell, of Skene Parish Church, said: "We wanted to do what we can to help them settle in to their new life here in Scotland." The fund will be managed by representatives of the Church of Scotland, Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre (AMIC), and the Aberdeenshire Partner Refugee Group. More details are available via info@nescu.co.uk	An appeal to raise money for Syrian refugees who have arrived in the north east of Scotland has been launched.
Sanchez, 40, signed a contract extension in January to remain in charge until the end of next season. However, Deportivo won just two of their last 22 league games and were beaten 8-0 at home by Barcelona on 20 April as they finished 15th. Former Spain and Real Madrid midfielder Sanchez was in charge of Deportivo for 13 months.	Deportivo La Coruna have sacked boss Victor Sanchez after a disappointing end to their season in La Liga.
Barry Gray's side have taken maximum points from their last four matches, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. In the night's other two league games, Glenavon host Glentoran and Portadown travel to Ballinamallard United. Carrick Rangers play Amateur League side Crumlin Star in a rearranged Irish Cup sixth round tie at Seaview. The winners will have home advantage against Crusaders in the quarter-finals of the competition. "We are just glad to have regular games. There has been so much 'is it going to be on, is it not going to be on' since we have had the problems with the pitch at Taylor's Avenue," said Carrick manager Gary Haveron. Warrenpoint now lie just one point behind fellow strugglers Ballinamallard, Dungannon and Carrick at the foot of the table thanks to a seven-match unbeaten league run which stretches back two months. "We are in a position now where nobody wants to sit out games. All the players are eager to get started again so everyone will be ready to go on Monday night," said 'Point boss Barry Gray. "The players we brought in during January have brought a freshness to the changing room and competition for places. "They have brought quality too and the players around them have stepped up to the mark. "Whether it's enough given our poor start to the season, we'll have to wait a couple of months to find out." Glentoran will be out to avenge a 4-1 sixth round Irish Cup defeat by Glentoran at the Oval when the sides meet again at Mourneview Park. The Lurgan Blues must plan without striker Eoin Bradley, who was sent-off in the 1-1 draw with leaders Crusaders on Friday night. Portadown central defender Ken Oman is suspended for his side's trip to Ferney Park after being dismissed in the victory over Linfield but Ronnie McFall's side should have Garry Breen and Sean Mackle available again. Ports assistant manager Kieran Harding has hailed the impact made by ex-Linfield and Derry City midfielder Philip Lowry since his recent arrival at Shamrock Park. "Philip has outstanding energy and he covers the ground. If we had him from the start of the season, we may not be in the position we are in," argued Harding, whose side have moved up to seventh in the standings. Mallards boss Whitey Anderson lamented his team's performance in a 3-0 loss to Warrenpoint on Friday and has made clear that he expects more from his players. "You can try to play all the good football you want, but unless you can display heart and desire it counts for nothing. That's what I want to see," said Anderson.

A 12-week consultation on the scheme, worth up to £1,200 a child, has begun. Families with two working parents could be able to claim, and ministers said carers who look after disabled relatives and others would be included. Chancellor George Osborne said stay-at-home mothers, who had made a "lifestyle choice", would not be eligible. The government says the overall scheme - set to replace the existing system of employer-supported childcare vouchers - will help 2.5 million families. It is aimed at getting more people back into jobs. The UK has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, with many people with two or more children saying it does not make financial sense for both parents to work. The new system is expected be phased in from autumn 2015, with children under five helped in the first year. It will then build up over time to include all children under the age of 12. Families with two working parents on less than £150,000 each would be able to claim up to £1,200 a year per child. Critics have said the focus on work will penalise parents who stay at home to look after their children, or are unable to work because they act as full-time "carers" for other adults. However, extra details released by the government on Monday make it clear that parents who do not work because they are carers will also be eligible. Carers are defined as those spending at least 35 hours a week looking after someone such as a disabled relative. But the scheme will not be extended to those who stay at home to bring up their children. Lisa Frederiksen, from Epsom, Surrey, was "staggered" by childcare costs for her children Casper, four, and Elizabeth, two. She said: "As a career-orientated woman, when I had my first child at the age of 40 I was staggered at the cost of childcare. "My employer would not agree to a part-time role, so I was faced with childcare costs of £1,200 per month. "After my second child, it became  apparent that working was not going to pay. With two lots of childcare and the costs of commuting, it just wasn't worth working. "My Danish husband's family cannot comprehend the cost of childcare here. They pay £300 a month for care in well-equipped, carefully staffed nurseries. "This new scheme is a drop in the ocean, but we need a radical rethink." Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: "This is help for formal childcare. Obviously it's not for stay-at-home mothers. "I have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children. That's their lifestyle choice. I want to help those families too. I'm not trying to be exclusive. "We have a proposal on married couples' tax breaks which I'm going to introduce in the Autumn Statement later this year... that will help stay-at-home mothers." Lynne Burnham, secretary of Mothers at Home Matter, called for a "level playing field" for all families, with the introduction of a "family allowance" for all households with children under the age of 16. She added: "It should not be for this government to dictate how a family chooses to care for its children." Under the proposal, parents will be required to open an online voucher account with a voucher provider and have their payments topped up by the government. For every 80p families pay in, the government will put in 20p, up to the annual limit of £1,200. The vouchers will be valid for any Ofsted-regulated childcare in England and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Half of the funding for the new scheme will come from the abolition of the previous system of employer-supported childcare vouchers  - which is provided by only about 5% of employers - and in part by funding switched from elsewhere in Whitehall. A separate scheme will provide funding for parents who claim universal credit. It will see the state cover up to 85% of their childcare costs, up from 70% at present. For Labour, shadow children's minister Sharon Hodgson said: "Only David Cameron's government could be so out of touch that they expect families to be grateful for help with childcare in 2015 when they've already seen costs spiralling and support taken away."	The government says it wants to expand a planned childcare tax credit scheme to include parents who stay at home because they are full-time carers.
Daniel Braxton was driving through Towyn, Conwy county, with his 18-year-old daughter at 07:15 BST on Tuesday. She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did. Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached. "We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Wales. "I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head. "She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes." Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old. "To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical," he added. "So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done." Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has "stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery". Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward. Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: "We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward. "Alternatively, if anyone knows who the mother is or can provide any information which may assist in identifying her please contact North Wales Police. "We want to ensure that the mother is provided with the medical support she needs."	A man has described how he managed to revive a lifeless newborn baby which was found in a bus shelter.
The original game was postponed on 26 November because of a frozen pitch. The offer from the Latics is for both home and away supporters visiting SportsDirect.com Park. Oldham, who are next to bottom of the table, three points from safety, have just exited a transfer embargo and reappointed John Sheridan as manager. "We want as many supporters to welcome back the manager to the football club as he takes his place on the sidelines for the first time," said a club statement. Supporters are, however, being invited to make a donation to a local charity. Brentford were the first team to offer free entry for a league game in England when they played Peterborough in 2001.	Oldham Athletic have offered free entry to all fans for their rearranged League One fixture against Peterborough United on Tuesday, 24 January.
Simon Cope delivered the package on the last day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine, which Wiggins went on to win. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee has been by told by Team Sky chief Sir Dave Brailsford the package contained a legal decongestant. But MPs say they are "concerned" by some of the evidence they have heard. The doctor who received the package on behalf of Wiggins' Team Sky, Dr Richard Freeman, and head of UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) Nicole Sapstead have also been invited to give evidence on 22 February. Culture, Media and Sport select committee chairman Damian Collins MP said: "There is a considerable public interest in Ukad's investigation and it is also important to our inquiry into doping in sport to understand what they have been able to determine from their investigation. "The committee has been told by both British Cycling and Team Sky that they have supplied all the information they have relating to this investigation to Ukad. "However, we need to know if they have received documentary evidence which confirms what was in the package that was delivered by Simon Cope to Team Sky. "Without this evidence, I am concerned about how it is possible for the anti-doping rules to be policed in an appropriate manner, if it is not possible to review the records of medicines prescribed to riders by the team doctors." Team Sky have been under pressure to reveal the contents of the package following a Daily Mail allegation in October 2016. Cope, who was a women's coach for British Cycling, travelled from Manchester to Geneva on 12 June 2011 to hand a parcel to the Team Sky doctor Freeman on the final day of the Criterium. Cope claimed he did not know what it contained. In an interview with Cycling News, he said: "It was just an envelope, a Jiffy bag, a small Jiffy bag," he said. "As far as I know I could have been pedals in there." Brailsford gave evidence in December and stated the package contained Fluimucil, which is legal in sport and "administered on a regular basis".	The British Cycling coach who couriered a 'mystery' package for Sir Bradley Wiggins has been invited by MPs to give evidence at a doping inquiry.
It was supposed to be a moment that rocked the virtual world. Mr Modi, widely acknowledged as one of the world's most influential politicians on social media, enveloped a slightly stunned Mark Zuckerberg in a bear hug. But what was it that really happened in Menlo Park? Why did some people think Mr Modi wasn't acting in India's best digital interests when he hugged Mr Zuckerberg? India with an internet population of 354 million - which has already grown by 17% in the first six months of 2015 - is an obvious target for not only Facebook, but other Silicon Valley giants. And they have all been more than happy to pledge their support for digital India -  a recently launched government initiative  aimed at reinvigorating an $18bn (Â£11.6bn) campaign to strengthen India's digital infrastructure. Google offered to provide 500 railway stations with free WiFi and Microsoft pledged to connect 500,000 Indian villages with cheap broadband access. But this huge show of support and the increased interest in India has caused some concern within the country. "Is Digital India going to only make India a consumer of services offered by global tech companies in lieu of data? Personal data is the currency of the digital world. Are we going to give that away simply to become a giant market for a Facebook or a Google? Look at the way the tech world is skewed. Only China has been able to come up with companies that can take on these MNCs" Prabir Purkayasta, chairman of the Society for Knowledge Commons in India, told the BBC. "The British ruled the world because they controlled the seas," he said. "Is India going to be content to just be a digital consumer? To being colonised once again?" And in the aftermath of the Facebook townhall in particular, some talk has begun to surface about what Mr Zuckerberg's real India ambitions are. Soon after the townhall ended, both Mr Modi and Mr Zuckerberg declared their support for digital India by using a special Facebook filter to tint their profile pictures in the tri-colour of the Indian flag. Multitudes of Indians followed suit and timelines were awash with snazzy tinted profile pictures, all in support of "Digital India". But then a tech website released what it claimed to be a portion of Facebook's source code, which allegedly "proved" that the "Support Digital India" filter was actually a "Support Internet.Org" filter. Facebook quickly issued a denial, blaming the text in the code on an "engineer mistake" in choosing a shorthand name he used for part of the code. But the "mistake" which has been coupled with a huge advertising blitz for Internet.Org across television channels and newspapers has raised suspicion about Facebook's motives. A Facebook poll on Internet.Org that frequently appears on Indian user timelines has also been ridiculed for not giving users an option to say no. Instead the answer options to the poll question  "Do you want India to have free basic services?" are "Yes" and "Not now". Internet.org (now called free basics), aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers. Facebook's vice-president of infrastructure engineering, Jay Parikh has described the initiative as an "attempt to connect the two-thirds of the world who do not have access to the Internet" by trying to solve issues pertaining to affordability, infrastructure and access. When Facebook launched the initiative in India in February, it was criticised by Indian activists who expressed concerns that the project threatened freedom of expression, privacy and the principle of net neutrality. On the other end of the debate, Indian columnist Manu Joseph wrote in the Hindustan Times newspaper, hitting out at the "selfish" stand on net neutrality. He said concerns over the issue should be "subordinate to the fact that the poor have a right to some Internet". A massive campaign by India's Save the Internet Coalition exhorting Indians to speak out against initiatives threatening net neutrality caught public imagination and saw more than a million emails to India's regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), demanding a free and fair internet in the country. Internet.Org was one of the initiatives immediately affected. TRAI since released a draft policy on net neutrality, but a question that has been asked is whether it was appropriate for Mr Modi to visit Facebook given that the policy was still under consideration. Mr Purkayasta is of the opinion that it could have been avoided. "It was not the time or the place to go. Even if it was simply a publicity gimmick, it still sends a signal to officials involved in drafting the policy," he said. However, Sunil Abraham from the Centre for Internet and Society told the BBC he believed that while Facebook's intentions were suspect, Mr Modi's visit had the potential to safeguard net neutrality in India. "India is a hugely important market for Facebook, and the prime minister has the power to force positive changes to its policies," he said. "We gain nothing by shutting them out."

Brantano employs about 2,000 staff in 140 stores and 60 concessions across the UK. Administrators from PwC are now running the Leicestershire-based business, which they said would trade normally while they sought a buyer. PwC's Tony Barrell said the chain was a victim of changing consumer habits. "The continuing challenging conditions for 'bricks and mortar' retail stores are well documented. "Like many others, Brantano has been hit hard by the change in consumers' shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment." Brantano, along with Jones Bootmaker, was bought by retail investment firm Alteri Investors in October from Dutch-based Macintosh Retail Group. Jones is not affected by the administration. Brantano is one of the first sizeable retailers to fall into difficulty this year after the key make-or-break Christmas trading period. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said that Alteri specialise in turning around failing business, but "it appears that Brantano's trading position was worse than than expected. Christmas trading, I'm told, was also below expectations." She understands that a number of possible buyers have already approached PwC. Mr Barrell added: "The administrators are continuing to trade the businesses as normal whilst we assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks. "Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work during the administration."	Discount shoe retailer Brantano has gone into administration, about four months after the chain was bought by an investment firm.
Four-month-old Eli Cox was found at an address in Lapwing Close in Minster, Sheppey, on 13 April and died in hospital on 27 April, Kent Police said. Katherine Cox, 32, and Danny Shepherd, 25, both of Millfield Road, Faversham, appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Both were released on conditional bail. Ms Cox and Mr Shepherd are also accused of one count of causing or allowing serious injury to a child and one count of possession of a class B drug (amphetamine). They are due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 13 December.	A man and a woman have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing the death of a baby.
UK Anti-Doping figures reveal players from Wales make up 33% of all sportsmen and women serving drugs bans. An ex-player, who took drugs, told BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme he is surprised more have not been banned. But WRU chief Martyn Phillips is not "overly concerned" because the number tested is proportionately higher than in other rugby unions and sports. The player, who would not be named, said: "It's totally off-the-scale. I think people are probably blind to it and if the truth came out I think there would be probably a lot more players who are banned from playing." The numbers caught are a small percentage of the thousands that play rugby, however 17 Welsh rugby union and league players, from grassroots to semi-pro, are currently banned, with the majority found to have traces of anabolic steroids in their systems. Ten of those banned are from rugby union and form the majority of the 16 players banned from the sport across the UK. UK Anti-Doping said the other seven are among 14 players banned from rugby league. The programme questioned 100 players from grassroots rugby union clubs and found 15 admitted to using some form of performance enhancing drug. Only five of that 100 said they had been drug tested in the past three years. Anti-doping expert Prof Yannis Pitsiladis, from the University of Brighton, said: "They can be quite confident when they go into testing that they won't be caught because the current testing will not be able to detect those drugs, because they are no longer in the system." But he said improvements in anti-doping technology and the ability to now keep samples for up to 10 years means athletes currently cheating may be caught in the future. UK Anti-Doping's chief executive Nicole Sapstead admitted keeping up with drug cheats is a constant battle. "I think if people really want to cheat the system they'll find a way," she said. "In an ideal world we'd be testing all sports all the time but that's not a reality for any anti-doping organisation in the world." Last week Merthyr Rugby Club player Owen Morgan, 25, and Glynneath RFC's Greg Roberts, 28, were banned for four years and two years respectively. Mr Morgan tested positive for the anabolic steroid drostanolone and the stimulant benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine. Mr Roberts tested positive for tamoxifen, which can be used for cancer treatment. WRU's Mr Phillips said: "It's a problem in society to start with. "I wouldn't sit here and say that it's not an issue in rugby because the fact that one player getting banned is one too many as far as I'm concerned. "So the challenge for us, not just in rugby but in sport generally, is we've got to try and get it out of the game. I don't think that's going to be easy. "The fact that we've caught people suggests there's an issue. So my job now is to get closer to that and to make sure we just become the best we can be to try and remove the problem." Chris Thair, chief operating officer of Wales Rugby League, called the figures a "wake-up call". He said: "It's a spike in the figures compared to previous years and it's not a great situation for the sport to be in. "It's not just a rugby issue, it's a huge global issue for all sports, and it's a challenge for everybody and we've got to do more." Week In Week Out, Rugby: Dirty Steroid Secret? Tuesday, 24 November, at 22:35 GMT on BBC One Wales	Steroid abuse is "off-the-scale" in Welsh grassroots and semi-professional rugby, it has been claimed.
Institutions across the UK are likely to be affected by joint action by the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1% which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2008. The employers maintain the offer is a good outcome for staff. The unions say they are willing to meet for last minute talks but say they are not optimistic "as the employers had so far refused to engage in talks aimed at resolving the dispute". Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at UCU, said: "There is widespread anger over the pay cuts staff have had to endure in recent years and all the reports we are getting suggest that Thursday's strike will be very well supported. "We are amazed the employers are still refusing to sit down with us to try and resolve this without any need for disruption. There are precious few hours left now, but our offer of talks remains open." Unison's head of higher education Jon Richards accused university management of "sitting on record surpluses, splashing out on senior management pay but refusing to give a decent wage to the staff who have made UK universities some of the best in the world". The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted "a low level impact on students". The spokesman said that they had made their final pay offer in May and had been engaged in a dispute resolution process with the unions throughout the summer. "We have met repeatedly over the last six months and as recently as last week." The spokesman added that "salary costs in most HE institutions will actually rise by around 3% this year. "Many staff will also get generous incremental increases and contribution pay. These pay increases will be seen as generous by many looking into the sector." He added that the GMB union had agreed to accept the pay offer for its members employed by universities. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison said that of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU says its members last went on strike over pay in 2006.	University staff have offered to meet employers for eleventh hour talks to avert a one-day strike over pay, planned for Thursday.
The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. "I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football," Rae told BBC Scotland. "I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. "Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things." Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. "The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline," added Rae. "The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell]." "He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged." The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. "The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in," he said. "The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure." The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. "These boys know the personnel and also the division," explained Rae. "The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator. He gets his teams at it. I have played against his Huddersfield - excellent back in the day. He will bring a lot to the table."	Lee Clark is a name well known to fans in England but the new Kilmarnock boss is less familiar in Scotland.
The Scottish champions went out 4-3 on aggregate after a 2-0 defeat in Sweden. Deila said: "The hype about the Champions League is big, everybody wants it so badly. You have to deal with it but we looked very stressed. "We didn't look like we wanted to go out and play football. We have a lot of young players coming through but this was a hard lesson for us." The Norwegian was new to the Celtic manager's job when his team was knocked out in the play-off round last season by Slovenian side Maribor. But having reshaped the team on his way to winning the Scottish Premiership in his debut season and across this summer, he was confident he could guide them into the group stage of the Champions League at the expense of the Swedish champions. And with a 3-2 lead heading to Malmo's 20,000 capacity stadium his side were in a strong position to qualify. Malmo are fifth in the Swedish league, seven points off the leaders with only nine matches to play of their summer season. Media playback is not supported on this device But Celtic will now compete in the Europa League and find out their opponents in Friday's group stage draw. Among the teams in Europe's second-tier competition are Liverpool and Tottenham. "We looked very uncomfortable on the ball. We looked frightened and scared and that is very disappointing," he said in his media conference afterwards. "It was a team performance that was not at the level we should expect at these games. We have to learn from this, some very hard learning. "We knew if we were at our best we had a good chance to go through but we were not even close. "We have shown that the Europa League is the level we have to compete at and it is better than nothing. It is a good competition." Asked about the goal Nir Bitton had disallowed for a foul - replays showing that Bitton's marker, Kari Arnason, had handled the ball in the aerial challenge - Deila felt Serbian referee Milorad Mazic had made "a big mistake". "It could have changed the game - it is irritating that we lost that," he said.	Celtic were "scared and frightened" in their Champions League exit to Malmo, said boss Ronny Deila.
The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version by X Factor's Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week. Ronson thanked "boy wonder" Bruno Mars, who features on the track, "without whom there would be no jam". Ed Sheeran, who scores a 10th week at the top of the album charts, fell to number two in the singles chart, while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three. The physical release of Do They Know It's Christmas? saw the charity track climb nine places, but it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran. East, who is the favourite to win this year's X Factor, performed the Ronson track during the show's semi-final on Saturday 6 December. Her mentor Cowell, who chose the track after Ronson and Mars pulled out of performing the song themselves on the talent show, called it "one of the top three performances" in X Factor history. East later apologised to Ronson, calling it "an amazing song". "I don't think anyone expected my performance to be as popular as it was," she added. Speaking to the Official Charts company, Ronson refrained from mentioning East, but thanked "everyone who bought, downloaded or DJ'd Uptown Funk this past week." "It's pretty much the coolest thing ever," he added. Featuring  Mars on lead vocals, Uptown Funk is the first single from British producer Ronson's fourth album, Uptown Special. Inspired by the feel-good funk of the 70s and 80s, it was already available in several countries around the world. Two Ronson tracks - Stop Me and Valerie, a collaboration with Amy Winehouse - reached number two in previous years.	Mark Ronson has clinched his first UK number one with Uptown Funk.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (Â£11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of "black cash" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, ($65; Â£52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects "unscrupulous" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at 'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3% of Indians file tax returns. But the switch has caused chaos with tens of millions of Indians queuing for hours to exchange and withdraw cash. The government was ill-prepared for the ban which suddenly put 86% of the country's money supply out of circulation. Many businesses only accept cash and hundreds of millions of Indians do not have bank accounts and only use cash.	India is using indelible ink on fingers to ensure people get only one chance to change their big bank notes.
The song topped the UK singles charts in February 1969 and remained number one for four weeks. It was also number one in many other countries and won the Ivor Novello award for best song composition. He died peacefully after a six-year battle with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a family statement said. The statement said his closest family were "with him to the last" and that many people would miss his songs and his music. Where Do You Go To (My Lovely), a song about a girl born in poverty who becomes a member of the European jet-set, was replaced as number one by Marvin Gaye's I Heard it Through the Grapevine. It was included in the compilation programme One-Hit Wonders at the BBC, which was broadcast on BBC Four last year, although Sarstedt also reached number 10 in the charts with Frozen Orange Juice in June 1969. He wrote more than a dozen albums in a career that spanned more than 50 years, releasing his last, Restless Heart, in 2013 Born into a musical family in India, Sarstedt was one of three brothers who all enjoyed success in the UK singles chart. His older sibling, Richard Sarstedt, who performed under the stage name Eden Kane, also topped the charts with Well I ask You in 1961, while younger brother Clive, performing under the name Robin Sarstedt, reached number three in 1976 with My Resistance is Low. Sarstedt's music reached new audiences when Where Do You Go To (My Lovely) was included in the Wes Anderson films Hotel Chevalier and The Darjeeling Limited, which were both released in 2007. According to his website, he retired in 2010 because of his illness - a rare, progressive neurological condition.	Singer-songwriter Peter Sarstedt, best known for the song Where Do You Go To (My Lovely), has died at the age of 75, his family has said.
Alasdair McCrone, of Mull Theatre, and Gordon McLean, of the arts centre An Tobar, were among three directors of the umbrella body Comar. It looks after a number of arts organisations on the island. Comar's board said funding restrictions made it necessary to reduce three posts to one. It said the three existing directorial posts - in theatre/dance, visual arts/film and music/literature - would be replaced by one artistic director who would lead the entire creative programme Comar, which was created two years ago, said it hoped to continue to work with both Mr McCrone and McLean. Equity blames poor business planning and is calling on the board to resign. A public meeting about the decision is to be held in Tobermory next week. High-profile Scottish actor Alan Cumming tweeted: "This makes me so sad.  Another example of the accountants take over at the expense of the art. And in Mull too." Former Scottish culture secretary and SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, Michael Russell, tweeted: "Making Alasdair & Gordon redundant is an extraordinary wrong-headed decision and must be opposed."	The actors' union Equity has hit out at the decision to remove two of Mull's best-known creative directors from their posts.
Miller served his ban from 2004 to 2006 after admitting using blood-boosting agent EPO early in his career. The 39-year-old returned to the sport and has volunteered to educate Britain's young riders. Technical director Shane Sutton said "nurturing an anti-doping culture" was at the heart of British Cycling. Millar won stages in road cycling's three most prestigious stage races - the Tour de France, Vuelta a Espana and Giro d'Italia - and also won 2010 Commonwealth gold for Scotland in the road race time trial. The Scot, who retired in 2014, is regarded as one of the sport's leading anti-doping campaigners. Sutton added: "Having someone of David's calibre on board to support us in this education process is invaluable. He is readily available to share his well-rounded experiences as a professional cyclist to the young riders who aspire to succeed in their careers. "David will work with the squad on a voluntary basis until the end of the month with a view to subsequently joining the team in a more official capacity."	British Cycling has revealed that David Millar, the former British road race champion who served a two-year doping ban, is mentoring its academy riders.
PwC's Northern Ireland economic outlook said this was despite overall unemployment having fallen by more than 10,000 since June 2014. It said poor productivity remains the single biggest challenge to Northern Ireland's sustained recovery. PwC's Esmond Birnie said the pace of recovery was "decelerating". "Over the past seven months business confidence has been mixed, sometimes negative but always lagging the GB regions," Mr Birnie, who is PwC's chief economist in Northern Ireland, said. "There have also been recent mixed messages around consumer confidence, with June 2015 seeing the first rise in unemployment for more than two years; this may simply be a blip - or it may be indicative of a deeper malaise. "Currently, Northern Ireland's output is still 8% below the pre-crisis peak of 2008 and is something of a two-speed economy with employment contracting in public sector and financial services but growing fairly rapidly in advanced manufacturing, pharma, food processing and tourism. "PwC forecasts that Northern Ireland's economic growth will remain the lowest of the 12 UK regions at around 1.8% in 2015 - lower than the 2.2% growth experienced in 2014 - and will fall again in 2016 to around 1.7%." The report said that Northern Ireland's unemployment claimant count increased by 200 between May and June, the first month-on-month increase since December 2008. It said that 62% of those registered as unemployed have been out of work for more than 12 months, while 19.7% of young people aged 18-25 are unemployed - well above the UK average of 13.2%. PwC said the recent budget "confirmed that welfare reform and austerity will continue and that Northern Ireland probably faces a further four years of challenging economic circumstances, particularly around public spending".	Northern Ireland's economic growth will remain the lowest of the 12 UK regions in 2015, a new report has said.
The referee was happy with conditions when he arrived at 11:00 GMT, but the situation deteriorated and he called the game off after a 13:00 inspection. "The persistent rainfall over the last 18 hours has meant that the pitch is unfit and the referee had no choice," said Oldham chief executive Neil Joy. No date has yet been agreed for the rearranged fixture.	The League One match between Oldham and Blackpool has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.
Seven straight wins have lifted the Warriors into third place in the table. "We've put ourselves in a good position and the players are confident they can finish off well over the next three games," Murray told BBC Scotland. "There is a great desire and passion among the guys to do well again this year. I'm confident that we can do it and go to another Pro12 final." Glasgow lost in the semi-finals in 2013 before reaching the final 12 months later, and went one better last year by beating Munster in the final to be crowned champions. The Warriors are two points behind leaders Leinster and Connacht with three games remaining - away to Scarlets, home to Zebre, and away to Connacht in the final round on 7 May. The top four enter the end-of-season play-off semi-finals, with the top two enjoying home advantage. "We've managed to steadily climb our way back up the league and we've got ourselves back into the top four," said Murray. "Our target is to get in the top four and then, from our performances, we might get in the top two. "But we are in a good place and we're starting to play some really good rugby at the right time of the season." Glasgow travel to Wales to face a Scarlets side sitting three points behind them in fourth and who will be looking to leapfrog their visitors with a victory. "We've played them there already this season in Europe and we beat them 9-6, so we'll take a lot of confidence from that," said Murray. "Our target is to win all three of those games and it depends on what happens in other games. "Other teams in the top four all have hard games, so there could be a lot more ups and downs for all the teams. "There are four good sides in the top four at the moment and, for us to put ourselves in a position where we win it, we have to be better than them." Murray thinks the prospect of a final in Scotland, on Saturday, 28 May, should also provide motivation. "What a great opportunity to go play at a Pro12 final at Murrayfield, but there's a lot of rugby to be played before then," he added.	Assistant coach Kenny Murray says there is a growing belief at Glasgow Warriors that they can retain the Pro12 title.
Police were called after reports of the attack between 17:00 GMT and 18:40 on Monday. The victim was walking near East Park Road at its junction with Shearbank Road when he bundled into a car. Two men have been arrested following the incident and police are appealing for more information. The boy was driven away in a red or maroon car after he was approached and threatened. Police say the boy was questioned about his relationship with a young woman. The boy was taken to Beechwood Court, Blackburn, where he said four men assaulted him leaving him with cuts and bruises to his head. He was later able to call for help from an address in New Bank Road before being taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital for treatment. Det Sgt Ben Hodgkinson, of Blackburn Police, said: "The circumstances would suggest this assault is linked to honour-based violence."	A 16-year-old boy has been kidnapped, assaulted and robbed in an attack linked to suspected "honour violence" in Blackburn.
News agency AFP said 10 people have been affected by E. coli in Bordeaux. It is thought a number of them had eaten rocket and mustard vegetable sprouts, believed to have been grown from seeds sold by Thompson and Morgan. The Ipswich-based company told the BBC it had no evidence of a link. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said no E. coli cases had been reported in the UK. However, it has revised its guidance and is advising people not to eat raw sprouted seeds, including alfalfa, mung beans (or beansprouts) and fenugreek. The agency said these should only be eaten if cooked until steaming hot throughout. A spokeswoman for Thompson and Morgan said the company sold "hundreds of thousands of packets of these seeds" throughout France, the UK and other parts of Europe every year. "We are very confident the problem is not with our seeds. People can still grow these seeds and use these seeds with absolute confidence," she said. "For such a small number of people to have been affected, it does suggest that the problem is perhaps in the local area, how the seeds have been handled or how they have been grown, rather than the actual seeds themselves." The company was co-operating fully with investigations, she added. Paul Hansord, the company's managing director, said: "We make sure that everything we do is to a high standard." He said the firm bought its seeds in bulk from suppliers around the world. The affected seeds may have been sourced from Italy. Thompson and Morgan also said they did not raise any seeds, instead selling packets via mail order to gardeners. Seven of those affected by the E. coli outbreak, who ate the sprouts at a country fair at Begres near Bordeaux, needed hospital treatment. Close contact The FSA says it is asking the company for more information about the seeds. There is no suggestion of a link to the German E. coli outbreak, which came from bean sprouts grown on an organic farm, but two people are said to be infected with a similar strain. Frederic Lefebvre, France's secretary of state for consumer affairs, was quoted by AFP recommending "consumers who bought these same products not use them". Mr Lefebvre added: "The link between the symptoms and eating of the sprouts so far has not been definitively established." The sale of the three seed types - mustard, rocket and fenugreek - has been halted in France. Thompson and Morgan have provided samples of these seeds to investigators in the UK. An FSA spokesman told the BBC: "We have been in contact with the French authorities about this outbreak and are aware that a UK business has been named in connection with it. "No cases of food poisoning have been reported in the UK linked with the outbreak in France but we are in close contact with the Health Protection Agency. "We have asked for further information from the French authorities with regard to the three named type of seeds to help us carry out investigations in the UK."	Officials are investigating a possible link between seeds sold by a UK firm and an E. coli outbreak in France.
"I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared," said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter. But the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out. Ms Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine. Undaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world. Beauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila. Opposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted. The recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further. Mr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive. "In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family," he said. "These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition." One of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator. He and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally. Mr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals. In scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and "the beauty of face" were most important. But training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said. Ms Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense. "There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist," she said. One exercise was called the "duck walk" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. "Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall," she said. And despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant Q&A, as well as advice from former pageant winners. Like Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles. She did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included "doing weird lunges and wiggling". Sian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum "begged me to, so I joined a local one". She joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010. They were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow. "In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal," she said. "The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing," Ms Maynard said. But she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she "didn't even know or bother to comb my hair". "So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips," Ms Maynard said. Sometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors. "And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know, 'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?' "It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work," said Ms Maynard, now 27. Even the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said. He helps pick the right outfits and involves himself with how a candidate "should sway on stage". He even helps pick a candidate's lipstick shade - anything to help improve her chances. He said mentors tried to build on a candidate's natural traits, such as whether to cultivate a sweet or sexy image. Some mentors do charge for their services, but most like Mr Gaffud do it "for the love of finding a girl". "This is a side project," he said, adding that mentors help pay for the candidate's make-up, pictorials, food and sometimes even their rent. Some mentors, however, go on to manage their beauty queen's careers after they are successful in pageants. "They don't expect us to pay for anything, which I just find really amazing," said Ms Seifert, "because these pageant aficionados have full-time jobs, but they really dedicate so much of themselves to helping us develop and train," she said. Becoming a beauty queen is not always glamorous, Ms Seifert cautioned. "The moment I got crowned was the moment all the hard work began," she said. In her case, being a Miss Philippines-Earth winner and Miss Earth runner-up meant many public appearances to promote environmental causes. Pageant winners have high public profiles in the Philippines, and winning a title is seen as coming with big responsibilities. As "an important public figure", it was important to set a good example to young girls who looked up to beauty queens, Ms Seifert said. Winners are feted, introduced to high-ranking officials, and often recognised on the street and asked to pose for photographs. Anjo Lorenzana, a lecturer from the Ateneo de Manila University who specialises in media and popular culture, said pageants were also an opportunity for the Philippines to promote its image on an international stage. "By winning international beauty contests, Filipinos, who are usually equated with lowly occupations, can be seen in a better light," he said. For the candidates, pageants can be a stepping stone for upward social or economic mobility, Jose Wendell Capili said. He added that Filipinos were deeply passionate about pageants, pointing to heated online discussions. "Rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes break up families, friendships and relationships," he said. Tammy David, who has been photographing pageants since 2007, said the most unusual pageant she shot was inside a large jail. "You could see how parents were proud because their daughter was Little Miss Bureau of Corrections," Ms David said. "Beauty pageants are everywhere."	Sandra Seifert is tall, pretty, smart and articulate, but it took a while for her to decide she wanted to take part in a beauty pageant in the Philippines.
Tidal energy specialist Nova Innovation said this was the first offshore tidal array in the world to deliver electricity to the grid. Two 100kW turbines have been installed so far in the Shetland Tidal Array at Bluemull Sound. The blades for the turbines were made by Shetland Composites. Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation said tidal energy was a "long-term source" of predictable renewable power, with the turbines generating to full power across all tidal conditions. Simon Forrest, managing director of Nova Innovation, said: "We are absolutely delighted to be the first company in the world to deploy a fully operational tidal array." Mr Forrest said the deployment of the second turbine showcased the technology. The UK Carbon Trust estimates a Â£126bn global tidal energy market could be developed by 2050. WWF Scotland said the turbines were another "major milestone" on Scotland's journey to becoming a "fully renewable nation". The charity's director in Scotland, Lang Banks, added: "With some of the most powerful tides in Europe, Scotland is well placed to lead in developing this promising technology, which will help to cut climate emissions and create green jobs right across the country." Jenny Hogan, director of policy at Scottish Renewables, said: "Scotland is already at the forefront of capturing power from the tides and waves, and Nova's latest news demonstrates that lead is well-deserved. "The country is already home to some of the most advanced marine energy technologies anywhere, as well as the European Marine Energy Centre: arguably the most advanced marine energy proving site in the world. "With companies like Nova and others all working on developing this cutting-edge technology, the sector holds huge promise for the future."	Turbines installed off the coast of Shetland could herald a "new era" in tidal energy, according to the company running the project.
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016. This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m. Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield. The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors. It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear. In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict. "We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one. "The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."	One of Scotland's largest animal feed producers has posted a rise in profits, despite reporting a "challenging" year for the industry.
Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group "embodied the spirit of the Resistance". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. "Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response," Mr Hollande said. "They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly." Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.	France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
Mae grŵp wedi'i sefydlu yn Arberth, Sir Benfro sy'n helpu i ddod â theulu o ffoaduriaid i'r DU a chynnig cartref iddyn nhw. Mae Arberth yn un o 10 tref yn y DU sydd wedi ymgymryd â chynllun gan Lywodraeth y DU yn 2016 i gymryd cyfrifoldeb o gefnogi cartrefu ffoaduriaid. Dywedodd un sy'n aelod o Croeso Arberth, Christina Hughes, wrth raglen Eye on Wales ar BBC Radio Wales nad oedd hi'n gallu "eistedd nôl a gwylio pobl yn dioddef". Felly daeth criw o bobl leol at ei gilydd i sefydlu'r grŵp, sy'n cymryd cyfrifoldeb o hyd at dri theulu drwy ddarparu cartref ar eu cyfer a'u helpu i ddysgu Saesneg er mwyn dod o hyd i waith. Mae ffigyrau yn dangos bod grwpiau cymunedol o'r fath wedi cefnogi hyd at 53 ffoadur y llynedd. Ond mae Croeso Arberth yn pryderu bod y broses yn un cymhleth. Roedd yn rhaid iddyn nhw gasglu £4,500 ar gyfer yswiriant ar gyfer y saith ffoadur maen nhw'n eu cefnogi, yn ogystal â chadw £6,000 mewn cyfrif i dalu am gyfieithwyr a chostau teithio. Mae £200 yn cael ei gadw 'nôl hefyd fel lwfans i aelodau o'r teulu. "Dyma oedd dechrau'r broses gyda nifer o ffurflenni gan y Swyddfa Gartref i'w llenwi," meddai Ms Hughes. "Doedd gennai ddim syniad faint o waith oedd yn ei gymryd. Hanner ffordd drwy'r broses roeddwn yn gofyn i fy hun 'be dwi'n ei wneud?' "Ond dwi'n falch fy mod wedi bwrw 'mlaen." Dyma beth sydd i ddisgwyl gan gymunedau sy'n noddi ffoaduriaid: Roedd rhaid i'r grŵp gael caniatâd gan Gyngor Sir Benfro cyn bwrw 'mlaen gyda'r cais i ddarparu cymorth i'r ffoaduriaid, yn ogystal â Citizens UK. Bellach mae'r broses ar ben ac mae teulu o saith ffoadur o Syria wedi cyrraedd Arberth. "Allai ddim credu bod y cyfan drosodd," meddai Ms Hughes. "Gan ein bod yn un o'r grwpiau cyntaf i gyflawni hyn dwi'n gobeithio wrth fynd ymlaen bydd y Swyddfa Gartref yn gwneud pethau'n gynt i grwpiau eraill."	Wrth i'r swyddfa gartref gyhoeddi £1m i helpu cymunedau noddi ffoaduriaid mae pryder ynglŷn â pha mor gymhleth yw'r broses.
Speaking from South Africa, Mr Machar told the BBC that his rebel faction could still negotiate a peace deal with President Salva Kiir. His statement comes despite last week's heavy fighting in the city of Malakal. Mr Machar, who first fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, is now being treated in Johannesburg. In July, Mr Machar's bodyguards and President Salva Kiir's presidential guards fought each other, sparking days of violence. Hundreds of people died and more than 100,000 fled across the border. The fighting erupted less than a year after a peace deal was signed to form a unity government and end the civil war. Riek Machar profiled Speaking to the BBC's HARDtalk programme, Mr Machar said: "I'm going to return to South Sudan." "Because President Salva Kiir doesn't want democratic and transparent and fair elections to be conducted, he attacked us, he has restarted the war. "But I am hoping that wise leaders in the region, and in Africa, and the rest of the world will throw up a political process which will bring about peace again, and the resuscitation of the peace agreement, and the reconstitution of the transitional government of national unity." Mr Machar also denied that claims that he was a warmonger, saying that his troops were simply defending themselves against government attacks. President Kiir's officials accuse Mr Machar's forces of starting the attacks. Both sides in the bitter conflict have been accused of perpetrating atrocities, the BBC's Karen Allen in South Africa reports. More on South Sudan's crisis:	South Sudan's sacked Vice-President Riek Machar - who fled the country in August - has vowed to return, saying his credibility is intact.
Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He was found safe and well the same day. Mahon, 41, admitted one charge of kidnap at Shrewsbury Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Judge Robin Onions told the defendant she was likely to receive a custodial sentence "of some length". During a hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court last month the prosecutor told the court the kidnap had been "pre-planned". Kelly Crowe told magistrates on 26 February: "When officers go around there (to Mahon's home) a number of baby items were present; cots, clothes, baby clothes, both female and male and also a to-do list. "She made reference to sterilisers, nappies, and milk for babies." The case has been adjourned until 12 May.	A woman has admitted kidnapping a nine-week-old baby boy in Telford.
We've asked BBC Sport readers to predict the top three before every race this season and, after the British Grand Prix, we got our calculators out and had a look at how many people got the top three bang on. The vast majority of you were on the money when it came to predicting the top two. Lewis Hamilton was top of the pile for 24% of BBC Sport's predictor users with Valtteri Bottas picked to finish second more than any other driver. However, third place caught a few of you by surprise. Sebastian Vettel was picked more times to finish third (7.5%) than any other driver but it was his Ferrari team-mate who snatched the final place on the podium. Seven percent of BBC Sport predictor users correctly predicted Kimi Raikkonen's third-place finish. Clearly there are some optimistic - or mischievous - McLaren fans out there as well. Fernando Alonso, who has not won a race in four years, was backed to win the British Grand Prix by 0.3% of predictor users. Keep fighting the good fight, McLaren fans. Fancy channelling you inner Nostradamus? Then head here to predict the qualifying top 10 for the Hungarian Grand Prix.	When it comes to Formula 1, you lot know your onions.
During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees. Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge. Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London. His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton. They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised. In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics. He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London. His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees. He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France. British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home. He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home. Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories. Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy. "The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway," he said. "It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help. "I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had." In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden. The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two. "Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared," Winton later recalled. "None of the 250 children on board was seen again. "We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through." Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned. He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children. In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend. Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them. Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport. In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. A train dubbed "The Winton Train" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital. In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion. In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: "In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today." It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis: "In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. "The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care."	Sir Nicholas Winton, who has died aged 106, has been hailed as a hero of the Holocaust.
A foul smell led residents to the site in March. The government says all the bodies were buried in a single night and include stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies. But Human Rights Watch says they must check to see if any of the people killed during anti-government protests in January have been buried there. Dozens of demonstrators died in protests over a proposed electoral law change which would have required a national census to be held before the presidential election could take place. The US-based watchdog Human Rights Watch (HWR) has said that bodies went missing during the protests and also during government crackdowns on criminal gangs in the capital last year and in 2013. Human rights workers first became aware of the burial site after residents of Maluku in Kinshasa reported a terrible smell near the local cemetery more than two weeks ago. A woman working in the field then discovered a limb sticking out of the ground. The DR Congo government has said that the bodies were all buried in individual graves on 19 March. A spokesman said on Monday that there would be no exhumations of the bodies.	The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been urged to investigate at least 421 bodies found in an unmarked burial ground in the capital, Kinshasa.
At about 21:00 BST on Friday, a man armed with a knife entered a shop at Northland Avenue in the Rosemount area and demanded money. Police said the suspect was restrained by members of the public until officers arrived and arrested him. Another man was arrested nearby a short time later. The men, who are both 19, are to appear in court on Monday. They are charged with attempted robbery, conspiracy to rob and possession of an offensive weapon.	Two men have been charged over the attempted armed robbery of a shop in Londonderry.
Imaginative thinking would be required to ensure trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was not affected, said Mr Ahern. But he believed customs checks were inevitable. Mr Ahern added that now was not the time for a border poll. Speaking to the BBC's Today Programme, he said: "There has to be far more consensus, there still is a divided society, the institutions are not operational. "The big issue, I think, for the Irish and the UK government is on the other side of 8 June is to try to help broker a deal to get the institutions back up and running and certainly having a border poll in the foreseeable future will not help that process." In March, Mr Ahern told the BBC's Newsnight programme that dissident republicans might use the re-introduction of border posts in Northern Ireland to justify their campaign of violence. He said a hard border with customs checks would have to be re-introduced because of the UK's decision to leave most of the customs union under Brexit. Mr Ahern drew a comparison with the IRA's so-called Border Campaign in the 1950s. But he said he did not expect a return to large-scale violence. The UK government has pledged to ensure there will be no return to the "hard border" of the past.	Former Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Bertie Ahern has warned there is no easy solution to resolving the Irish border issue before the UK leaves the EU.
A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
The men, aged 26 and 24, were in a house in Melrose Street when three men armed with a knife, hammer and batons forced their way into the property just before midnight on Saturday. After assaulting the men, the gang left with a sum of cash and personal items. They also smashed a number of windows. The men in the house received medical treatment for their injuries. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Two men have been assaulted by an armed gang in south Belfast.
But he says the only way to attract viewers to his vlogs is by being "incredibly, painfully honest". "The economy of YouTube is based off honesty porn. It's just, how far can you go?" the 24-year-old says. "The more horrendously out there and honest you are, the more people respond to that. It's unhealthy. They're all addicts." Honesty is something he says he is attracted to however, and that's one of the reasons he agreed to take part in a new documentary - The Creators - which goes behind-the-scenes in the life of vloggers. Watch TomSka talking about how hard it is now to make your mark in the world of YouTube To begin with he says he was worried that it would be another "puff piece" talking about how "kids make money in their bedrooms, like every news report" on them. And, given how much of their lives are already public, it could seem like an odd choice of subject for a documentary maker. "Even though they are sharing their lives, they're not necessarily sharing all the different aspects of what it's like to be a vlogger," says Nanette Burstein, the Oscar-nominated director behind the film. "This was an opportunity to get them to open up." Along with TomSka, The Creators also features Zoella and twins NikiNSammy. "They put in me ranting about things and it wasn't just 'everything is lovely'," TomSka says. "I mean you do get a lot of everything is lovely because you see Zoella, who is just lovely... but then you get me being all pessimistic." He says, unlike other vloggers, he finds it harder to make money through brand endorsements. "As YouTube has grown, managers and people have learned to apply the Disney kid method," he says. "They become these deities, these beings of perfection in the eyes of their audience. And that is worth a lot more money. "I would rather put an honest version of myself forward. And it makes me no money. No-one wants to buy a shirt with me on it." He did get in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority last year, over a promotion with a biscuit brand, that was said not to be clearly labelled as an advert. "I've always tried to be very open and very honest with my audience. I've been caught out by that recently. Apparently I wasn't honest enough," he says. He has been open about his problems with mental illness as well, sharing videos with his fans about his depression. "I really don't know what long-term effects my relationship with my audience and with YouTube is going to have on me," he says. "I like sharing and I like being very honest and I have found that it feels good but then again maybe it's not. "I've forgotten what the difference is between Thomas Ridgewell and TomSka." "You put me in a room with 1,000 fans and I can take photos and sign and be lovely to every single person. "But you put me in a room with 10 people who know the real me and I'm not going to know what to do any more." The Creators is available to view on YouTube now.

He vowed to recover billions of dollars "stolen" under previous administrations. Mr Buhari held talks with state governors over the lack of money to pay government workers their salaries. He and his All Progressives Congress won elections in March, ending some 16 years of rule by the Peoples Democratic Party. He was sworn in less than four weeks ago, taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who had been in office since 2010. "The days of impunity and lack of accountability are over," he told state governors. "The next three months may be hard, but billions of dollars can be recovered, and we will do our best," he added. In an earlier briefing with journalists, he said it was a "disgrace" that government workers had not been paid for months. African news updates "This bad management we find ourselves in - we really need your help to protect us from people before they march on us," he said. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo estimates that Nigeria's debts stand at about $60bn (Â£38bn). However, former Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has rejected the claim, saying the debt was much lower and most of it was incurred by states, rather than the federal government, AFP news agency reports. The president won the elections on a promise to tackle corruption, and to lead Nigeria to greater prosperity. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, but most of its citizens are poor.	Nigeria's treasury is "virtually empty", President Muhammadu Buhari has said.
McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring and Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead. A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time. But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts.	Declan McManus scored twice as Greenock Morton beat Scottish Championship bottom side Alloa Athletic, who remain 10 points adrift.
The cargo ship SS Politician, which had 28,000 cases of whisky, sank off Eriskay in Western Isles 75 years ago. Eight bottles of the whisky were recovered by a diver in 1987. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) has suggested that two bottles it has on the Isle of Canna could be added to these eight known bottles. The bottles in the care of NTS are kept at Canna House and belonged the late John Lorne-Campbell and his wife Margaret Faye-Shaw, who gifted the property and Hebridean island to the trust. Fiona McKenzie, archivist at Canna House, said: "According to the previous archivist, the bottles have 'always been at the house'. "She was here from the 1960s and that's well before the diver brought up eight bottles in 1987. So looks like we may have two bottles that are not included in the official stats." Many other bottles were salvaged from the SS Politician at the time of its sinking in 1941 and still thought to survive, but have not been officially recorded. Hundreds of cases of whisky were hidden from customs officers by islanders. Some locations of these secret stashes have since been forgotten, according to islanders today. The SS Politician was headed for Jamaica when it ran aground on the northern side of Eriskay in bad weather. Scottish author Compton Mackenzie, published the novel Whisky Galore in 1947, which was loosely based on the shipwreck. It was adapted for the cinema in a 1949 Ealing comedy.	Two bottles of whisky recovered from a shipwreck that inspired the book Whisky Galore may have been missed from official statistics.
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects. The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said. "Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement. "They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings. "The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit." Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings. Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions. The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty. However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation. The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment. The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand. He had previously rejected offers of assistance. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.	UK police are to return from Thailand after reviewing an investigation into the murders of two British tourists, Scotland Yard has said.
If this volume is hard to visualise, imagine the Earth's entire land surface covered in a layer some 180m deep. The new calculation comes from a Canadian-led team and is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Significantly, little of this water - just 6% - is the kind of bankable resource that is most useful to people. That small fraction is referred to as "modern" groundwater: it is extractable because it is near the surface, and can be used to supplement above-ground resources in rivers and lakes. "It's the groundwater that is the most quickly renewed - on the scale of human lifetimes," explained study leader Tom Gleeson from the University of Victoria. "And yet this modern groundwater is also the most sensitive to climate change and to human contamination. So, it's a vital resource that we need to manage better." To quantify just how much water is stored in the top 2km of the Earth's surface, Dr Gleeson's team had to combine large data sets with an element of modelling. They included information on the permeability of rocks and soil, on their porosity, and all that is known about water table gradients, which tell you about inputs from precipitation. Key to determining the age of all this stored water is a collection of thousands of tritium measurements. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that spiked in the atmosphere 50 years ago as a result of thermonuclear bomb tests. It can therefore be used as a tracer for all the rain that has made its way underground ever since. The map above shows the distribution of this modern groundwater around the globe. Dark blue shows where it is very quickly renewed. Light blue shows the older groundwater, which is mostly stagnant and non-renewable. "Old water is highly variable," Dr Gleeson told BBC News. "Some places it is quite deep, in some places not. In many places, it can be poor quality. "It can be more saline even than ocean water and it can have lots of dissolved metals and other chemicals that would need to be treated before it could be used for drinking or agriculture." This puts further emphasis on the modern reserves and the need to manage them in a sustainable way. The study underlines just how unevenly they are spread around the globe. The next step, Dr Gleeson said, was to try to work out just how fast some water stores were being depleted. Also writing in Nature Geoscience, Ying Fan, from Rutgers University, US, commented that "this global view of groundwater will, hopefully, raise awareness that our youngest groundwater resources - those that are the most sensitive to anthropogenic and natural environmental changes - are finite".

The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and "reduce the risk" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was "bitterly disappointed" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: "This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary." She said there was "no option" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: "It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs." Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would "find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East" and the council was "very likely to face legal challenge". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a "real risk" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: "I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce." He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.	Durham County Council has approved plans to cut the salaries of teaching assistants by nearly 23% by not paying them during school holidays.
The degrees form part of the UK's cyber security strategy published in 2011. The strategy recognised that education was key to improving defences against hackers and online fraud. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said internet cyber security was a "crucial part" of the government's long-term plan for the British economy. He said the courses would help to make the "UK one of the safest places in the world to do business online". He said: "Through the excellent work of GCHQ, in partnership with other government departments, the private sector and academia, we are able to counter threats and ensure together we are stronger and more aware." UK universities were invited to submit their master's degree courses for certification. The universities now running GCHQ-approved programmes in cyber security are Edinburgh Napier University, Lancaster University, the University of Oxford and Royal Holloway, University of London. GCHQ has also given provisional accreditation to Cranfield University's cyber defence and information assurance course, and the University of Surrey's information security course. A spokesman for GCHQ said the universities "were judged to provide well-defined and appropriate content, delivered to the highest standard".	Intelligence agency GCHQ has accredited six UK universities to teach specialist master's degree courses to future internet security experts.
Pools, who were relegated from the English Football League last season, lost their opening game at home to Dover on Saturday but started well at Moss Rose, with Cassidy and Jack Munns both firing inches wide. Macclesfield hit back, with Danny Whitaker's volleyed effort superbly tipped away by goalkeeper Scott Loach. The home side took the lead in the 38th minute when Elliott Durrell's ball into the box was headed home by Whitaker. There was a let-off for Hartlepool at the start of the second half when a mistake from defender Scott Harrison set Tyrone Marsh clear but he shot straight at Loach. Pools levelled after 58 minutes when Cassidy nodded in a cross from Ryan Donaldson and came closest to winning it when the striker's flicked header was saved.

Media playback is not supported on this device The Briton, 30, won 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 after two hours and 39 minutes, with match point clinched at 20:57 BST. Fognini, the 29th seed, had five set points to force a fifth set but Murray won five games in a row to seal a place in the last 16 for the 11th time. Murray will play Frenchman Benoit Paire in the fourth round on Monday. Fellow Briton Johanna Konta earlier reached the second week for the first time with a 6-4 6-1 win over Maria Sakkari of Greece. Media playback is not supported on this device "The end of the match was tense. It was an up and down match. I didn't feel like it was the best tennis at times but I managed to get through," Murray told the BBC. "It was getting dark towards the end and I was probably thinking a bit about that. "We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four." Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. "I feel OK," added Murray. "I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday. "I'm happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on."	Defending champion Andy Murray won a thrilling third-round contest against Italy's Fabio Fognini at Wimbledon as darkness fell around Centre Court.
Colin Hughes was attacked in Old Swan in September 2010 as he went to investigate a noise at the door of his  home. Two men, aged 18 and 21, from Old Swan and Huyton, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday. Detectives have arrested six people as part of the inquiry, but no-one has been charged. Mr Hughes had been playing cards with his fiancee Paula Greenwood when they heard the glass in the back door smash at about 0045 BST on 21 September. Ms Greenwood went to call the police while Mr Hughes, a chef at a local pub, went to investigate. She later found him lying face down in the garden. He was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. A post-mortem examination found he died from a single stab wound.	Two men arrested over the killing of a 42-year-old man in his back garden in Liverpool have been released on bail.
Both teams had a man sent off - the Terrors' Lewish Toshney, and solitary goalscorer Jason Cummings who picked up two yellow cards apiece at Tannadice. Cummings volleyed in the only goal after 38 minutes, shortly after Toshney's dismissal. But his 75th-minute sending off for punching the ball into the United net made for a nervous finale for Hibs. Neil Lennon's side extended their lead at the Championship summit to nine points, ahead of second placed Falkirk, who play Ayr United on Saturday. Ray McKinnon's United are 10 points adrift in third place, having played a game fewer than Hibs. Clearly, the home side had to start on the front foot and pressure their opponents. With games running out they really had to win to close the gap the Easter Road side. United's eagerness to play at pace and be in Hibs' faces ultimately cost them, epitomised by Toshney's rashness. The right-back was lucky to escape one early reckless challenge, but was correctly punished for another on Andrew Shinnie, and when he clattered the midfielder once again, it was a simple decision for referee Don Robertson. Hibs quickly asserted themselves by going in front and it became too big a task despite Cummings' offer of assistance. United didn't lack fight. They lacked composure and quality on the night. A first home defeat this season was badly timed. They're not entirely out of the title race, but the smart money would be on a play-off place for the Tannadice side. Head coach Lennon might not admit it but few will back anyone other than Hibernian to take the Championship title now. Cummings' fabulous first-half finish was timely, not too long after Toshney's red card. The striker stole in behind a defence that seemed intent on playing a high line. Shinnie exposed that with a lovely lofted ball into Cummings' path and he made no mistake with a vital, instinctive goal. Cummings was also unlucky to be flagged offside when clean through and might have earned a penalty when William Edjenguele appeared to catch him near the goalline just before half-time. It was the 21-year-old's 20th goal of the season - great work from him all-round, until later. Martin Boyle should have ended the contest when he had time, and space six yards out, but volleyed wildly over. The impressive Shinnie thought he had sealed the win after great work from Boyle, only for Cammy Bell to parry his shot over the bar. Hibs rarely looked troubled with goalkeeper Ofir Marciano a virtual spectator. This was a massive step for Lennon's men, and with three home games to follow, they are very much on track for the top flight. For all his positives, Cummings risked this win with few minutes of madness. He was unnecessarily booked for throwing the ball away when ruled offside. Minutes later he threw himself at a cross, blatantly punched the ball in the net and was correctly ordered off. It was utter madness and offered United a lifeline from nowhere. Luckily for him, his team mates saw it through. In total, 10 players were booked, and Lennon was ordered to the stand late on. However, Hibs got the job done, and deserved to finish with three valuable points. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "It was extremely difficult when we went down to 10 men. "I thought we started the game excellently and controlled the first 15 minutes, but the sending-off certainly had a massive impact on the game. "I haven't seen it again, but Lewis has gone for the ball and then he has pulled out. It was clear for everybody on our bench. "The ref is entitled to make that decision, but we were very disappointed. You have to look at all the decisions that were made and some of inconsistencies and tackles that went unpunished. "But what is important is what we do from now until the end of the season and focus on winning every game. "I thought we showed great character to battle back hard with 10 men. We will take the positives out of that and fight for every point until the end and see where we end up." Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "Jason's got to learn to control his temper. "I've been there - I got many a telling off from Martin O'Neill in my younger days - but he's an outstanding talent and he's come up with a really big goal in a big game and he does it consistently and it's not a coincidence. "We were outstanding. The only disappointment was the sending off really, which put us on the back foot for 10 minutes. "The rest of the game, we played really strongly and we looked a very good side. Thoroughly deserved to win. "I wanted them to put down a marker for the rest of the season and hopefully they've done that. "It is a difficult place to come and win, but I thought we were head and shoulders above Dundee United. "I underplayed it this week, but it is probably the biggest game we've had league wise for two or three seasons and they've responded brilliantly." Match ends, Dundee United 0, Hibernian 1.

Worst affected is the Abruzzo region, still recovering from a 2009 quake, while towns hit in Marche and Lazio last year are also badly affected. More than 300,000 people are without power in Abruzzo and traffic has been disrupted in the Marche quake zone. Three deaths across Italy have been attributed to freezing weather. A man of 67 was found dead in the street in Ceglie Messapica, Puglia, and a homeless man of 53 was found dead in a square in Canicatti, Sicily. A man aged 67 died in Giulianova, Abruzzo, after falling from a boat into icy water. Fabrizio Curcio, head of the country's Civil Defence Department, told Italian radio the harsh weather was expected to last until Thursday night at the earliest. The temperature in Amatrice, Lazio, where 236 people were killed by the earthquake on 24 August, and Arquata del Tronto, Marche, where 46 died, is set to fall as low as -6C on Tuesday night, with more snow forecast. That quake left several thousand people homeless, while a further tremor on 30 October put 30,000 out of their homes. Up to 1.3 metres (4.3ft) of snow is lying on the ground in Marche, where some 20,000 people were without power on Tuesday, the regional authorities said. Camps for people made homeless by the quakes in Marche region are now closed with most people moved to hotels along the Adriatic coast or into secure houses, flats or container homes, the press office told the BBC on Tuesday. Meanwhile, buildings made fragile by the tremors are under renewed pressure from the weight of the snow. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the fire service has been continuing its earthquake recovery work in Norcia, Umbria, another town badly damaged by tremors. The cold snap continues to affect other parts of Southern Europe. Snow fell in Spain's Balearic islands as well as the east coast city of Valencia. Weather forecasters said temperatures in the Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain could fall as low as -30C.	Central Italy is in the grip of heavy snowfall and very low temperatures, adding to the disruption caused by recent huge earthquakes.
This is demonstrably false. Far-right parties failed to pass a 5% barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a "Belarusian neo-Nazi". The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his "courageous and selfless service". The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal "is to prepare for a race war". Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. "Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship," said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services. Nevertheless, the fact is, neo-Nazis are indeed a fixture in Ukraine's new political landscape, albeit in small numbers. As Mr Korotkykh's case demonstrates, the ultra-nationalists have proven to be effective and dedicated fighters in the brutal war in the east against Russian-backed separatists and Russian forces, whose numbers also include a large contingent from Russia's far right. As a result, they have achieved a level of acceptance, even though most Ukrainians are unfamiliar with their actual beliefs. The volunteer Azov Battalion is a case in point. Run by the extremist Patriot of Ukraine organisation, which considers Jews and other minorities "sub-human" and calls for a white, Christian crusade against them, it sports three Nazi symbols on its insignia: a modified Wolf's Hook, a black sun (or "Hakensonne") and the title Black Corps, which was used by the Waffen SS. Azov is just one of more than 50 volunteer groups fighting in the east, the vast majority of which are not extremist, yet it seems to enjoy special backing from some top officials: Ukraine's media have been noticeably silent on this subject. Recently, prominent newspaper and online publication Left Bank published an extensive interview with Mr Troyan, in which the journalists asked no questions at all about his neo-Nazi past or political views. And after the Unian news agency reported the presidential ceremony under the headline, "Poroshenko awarded Belarusian neo-Nazi with Ukrainian passport", it was soon replaced with an article that air-brushed out the accusations of extremism. Unian's editors have declined to comment on the two pieces. There are significant risks to this silence. Experts say the Azov Battalion, which has been widely reported on in the West, has damaged Ukraine's image and bolsters Russia's information campaign. And although Ukraine is emphatically not run by fascists, far-right extremists seem to be making inroads by other means, as in the country's police department. Ukraine's public is grossly under-informed about this. The question is, why doesn't anyone want to tell them?	Ever since Ukraine's February revolution, the Kremlin has characterised the new leaders in Kiev as a "fascist junta" made up of neo-Nazis and anti-Semites, set on persecuting, if not eradicating, the Russian-speaking population.
Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for "lone-wolf" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: "Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. "The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect." Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold "can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: "In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. "The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."	Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested.
Keane, 23, who has played for England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels, will report to St George's Park on Tuesday with the rest of the squad. Gareth Southgate called him up after Johnson was ruled out of Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Malta. On Monday, Andros Townsend replaced the injured Raheem Sterling in the squad. Crystal Palace's Townsend, 25, has played 11 times for his country and scored three goals, but was not selected for Euro 2016. He has played in all seven of Palace's Premier League games since joining from Newcastle for £13m in the summer. England, led by interim manager Southgate, face Malta on 8 October and Slovenia three days later. No details have yet been given on Manchester City player Sterling's injury. Keane has featured in all of Burnley's Premier League games this term. Between 2013 and 2016, the former Manchester United trainee made 16 appearances for the under-21s side under Southgate. Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Southampton), Joe Hart (Torino, on loan from Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley) Defenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Michael Keane (Burnley), Danny Rose (Tottenham), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kyle Walker (Tottenham) Midfielders: Eric Dier (Tottenham), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Michail Antonio (West Ham), Jesse Lingard (Manchester United), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Dele Alli (Tottenham), Andros Townsend (Crystal Palace) Strikers: Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Jamie Vardy (Leicester)	Burnley defender Michael Keane has been handed his first international call-up after Stoke's Glen Johnson withdrew from the England squad through injury.
The US posted annualised growth of 2.6% for the fourth quarter - lower than the 3% projected by economists. The figure was weaker than the 5% growth in the third quarter of 2014. However, the dramatic slide in fuel prices in recent months has put more money in consumers' pockets and allowed them to spend more. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, rose by 4.3% in the fourth quarter - the fastest rise in nearly nine years - and higher than the 3.2% for the third quarter. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said: "It took us a while to get here, but I think the economy is finally off and running. "We are seeing a number of positive developments. Businesses are hiring aggressively and the big drop in gas prices means that people have more money to spend on other items." The near-60% slide in oil prices in the plast seven months has cut the price of petrol to about $2 per gallon, or the equivalent of Â£1.32 for 4.5 litres. That is little more than British drivers pay for just one litre of petrol. The fall has saved Americans about $175bn, Mr Zandi said: "A big part of growth this year will be people spending their gas savings." For 2014 as a whole, the economy expanded by 2.4% - better than the 2.2% for the previous 12 months. The report came two days after the Federal Reserve said the US economy was expanding at a "solid pace", but said it will "remain patient" in determining when to raise interest rates. The main rate has been held at close to zero since December 2008. Some economists believe an increase could come in middle of the year, but Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said Friday's data could delay a rise until late this year or even early 2016. He feared that the US economy was too reliant on consumer spending given that business investment fell by an annualised rate of 1.9% - the biggest decline since the second quarter of 2009. "Ideally, a sustainable economic upturn requires business spending to be rising alongside consumer expenditure." "While Markit's Flash PMI survey data signalled a further robust expansion of private sector business activity in January, the latest reading was the second weakest for 11 months and points to GDP growth sliding to 2% in the first quarter," Mr Williamson added. "Companies also reported the weakest monthly increase in new orders since the recession, suggesting the pace of economic growth could weaken even further in February."	The world's largest economy expanded less than expected in the final three months of 2014 despite lower fuel prices boosting consumer confidence.
The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to "reduce significantly" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the changes are yet to be announced. Downing Street said the prime minister accepted reforms needed to take place. However, officials have refused to say when any decisions might be taken. Critics say stop and search unfairly targets the black community. In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped. On 4 December, Home Secretary Theresa May wrote seeking approval from the cabinet's home affairs committee to a "package of measures". This included a plan to "amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 so that the test for the power's use is 'necessary' and 'expedient', (to prevent incidents involving serious violence)". Under Section 60, police can stop and search someone for weapons in a designated area, for a specific time, without suspicion that the individual is involved in wrongdoing. However, a senior officer must hold a reasonable belief that violence has happened or may occur in the area. Mrs May told cabinet colleagues she intended to "raise the level of authorisation to a senior officer who must reasonably believe that violence 'will' take place (as opposed to 'may')". She continued: "I expect this to reduce significantly the number of stop and searches under section 60. Section 60 is only one kind of stop and search." One minister told Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg that "we all want to get on" with the changes. But sources told her they feared "there's just a lack of will, a fear of looking soft on crime". The Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals and Labour has offered cross party talks to push the policy forward. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: "Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search." The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: "Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. "If I was talking to someone in government I'd say: 'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'." He added: "There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them. This would be a massive message in the right direction." While filming in Brixton, south London, Newsnight spoke to a teenager who said he had been stopped and searched as an 11 year-old. "Since then I've despised them [the police] more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress," he said. "They've got such a big mob mentality." Another young man said he had been stopped and searched by the police "over 100 times" because he was "in a black neighbourhood" where the police "think everyone is a drug dealer". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed that random stop and search powers had created distrust between some communities and the police in London. He said over the last two years the Met had reduced the number of stop and searches by over a third, while doubling the number of arrests to one in five. "We employ human beings, they make mistakes and when we make a mistake - particularly with someone who's innocent of any crime, and frankly never will be guilty of any crime - we leave a really bad imprint on that child, on that family, so it's important we get it right. "But I think it's an important power, that used wisely, is really effective."	Plans to limit police stop and search powers in England and Wales have been held up by "regressive" attitudes in Downing Street, senior Conservatives have told BBC Newsnight.
From her early days as a prodigious youngster, the career-threatening injury, the comeback and first world title to the iconic gold at London 2012. Then came Ennis-Hill the mum, a second world title and her final act, a silver at Rio. Minichiello has seen it all and tells BBC Sport why the "hard-working mum" deserves her place as Britain's greatest ever athlete. "How would I describe Jess in three words? A hard-working mum. "Leading into London she was an athlete first and foremost. But after her son Reggie was born she was a mum who did athletics. That is a lovely example, look at her, how she changed, she became just a mum with a hobby. "The World Championship medal in 2015 and the Olympic medal at Rio was more about doing something for her son; her son would see that and have an affinity with it. He is very sporty, and can throw a broom handle thinking it's a javelin. "He has seen his mum, whatever memory he may or may not have, he will have experienced what his mum's reputation will always be." Media playback is not supported on this device "I met Jess when she was nine. I was teaching on summer camps at the time and I saw this kid who stood out from her peers because she was just that bit quicker. "She only came down because her friend came down but she stuck with it and the friend went in a different direction. "Jess kept exceeding and exceeding expectations, people criticised her for being too small, said she'd never make it. They said my coaching was no good. But I was like 'no, come and see this kid, what she does, she is tenacious, a highly-competitive individual'. "She can be a pain, she is always ultra competitive. She gets it from her mum, even lobbing a drinks bottle into a bin from five metres. "Her best quality is her ability to be ultra competitive but be incredibly grounded and modest. She is critical of herself. She does not say 'look at me, the great I am'. She is modest and strives to be better and has an incredible work ethic. You could not ask for any more. She got her physicality from her parents and add that to the work ethic and competitive bit; bring all that together and you have lightning in a bottle. "She has always been sassy and was a cheeky little kid. But she has that determination to do better and never be satisfied with her performance." Media playback is not supported on this device "For me, the highlight of her career wasn't London 2012, but coming back from pregnancy and winning the World Championship in Beijing in 2015. "Number two would coming back from three stress fractures in her foot and winning her first World Championship in 2009 because that was potentially a career-threatening injury. The home Olympics was big but in my perspective overcoming adversity was better. "London was superb, but a bit surreal because the crowd were so supportive. It wasn't quite the same pressurised environment. Normally on the first day of a heptathlon it is three men a dog, but it was packed. "I have two great memories from London. The first was when she was introduced in the last heat of the 800m. They went down the line and when the announcer got to lane eight - Jess' lane - he was drowned out by the noise of the crowd. "The second was so many people staying in the stadium for the medal ceremony and singing the national anthem. It was the first gold medal and the first time the stadium heard the anthem." Media playback is not supported on this device "After Rio, I said 'go and take two or three months and make sure you're happy with the decision'. There will be no comeback, no Frank Sinatra moment, it won't be that, even though you get good odds for her to compete at Tokyo... the bookies were offering 10-1. "She had the shortest competitive preparation for Rio with injuries and it was not the most sensible competitive programme to try and retain an Olympic title. It had been a struggle, three injuries to get over and her body was not as forgiving as it was. She had this in mind when she made a judgement call about competing at the World Championships in London in 2017. Find out how to get into athletics with our special guide. "It was time. In fairness there is a new generation of British athletes coming through and the hope is they can step up and succeed. It's their moment, no need to dwell on the past, her time has been. "I will miss it, I like going to major championships, I like the buzz. But I have a whole new crop and hopefully have one or two who can make it." "If you look at somebody who in a career has won a medal at the youngest stage and gone all the way through to winning an Olympic medal, the changes that you had in that lifetime, that defines a career. "To come back from three injuries and to win a world title, again that would define a career. To win a home Olympics, again that would define you, To come back after pregnancy as a mum and how organise time and win a world title and Olympic medal, anyone of those individually would all define a career. To have done all four, that is staggering. "She is better than Daley Thompson, he never gave birth and came back and won, he trained and trained. To balance her home life and do that makes her the best British athlete ever." Toni Minichiello was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Davis.	Coach Toni Minichiello has been by Jessica Ennis-Hill's side through the highs and the lows of her golden career.
From 21 June, EDF customers will see electricity prices increase by 9% and gas prices go up by 5.5%. The supplier previously increased electricity prices by 8.4% on 1 March, although it cut gas prices in January. The rise was immediately criticised by the energy regulator, Ofgem, which said it was hard to justify. The average dual-fuel customer will pay an extra Â£78 a year, bringing the annual bill to Â£1,160, EDF said. Combining both increases will mean that 1.5 million EDF customers will pay 18.1% more for their electricity this year. However, taking into account the previous cut, gas prices will remain flat, the company said. Most of its customers - 1.8 million - are now on fixed price deals, so will not be affected. Ofgem was highly critical of the increases. Dermot Nolan, its chief executive, said: "EDF's second price rise in four months, when there has not been a dramatic rise in wholesale energy prices since it last put up prices, is difficult to justify and is further evidence that the energy market is not working in all consumers' interests." Commentators said EDF customers on standard tariffs could save more than Â£300 a year by switching to the best fixed-price deal. "EDF has hit millions with a second shock price hike," said Archna Luthra, head of energy at MoneySavingExpert. "If you haven't compared and switched already, see this as a final red alarm bell to take action - what are you waiting for?" EDF said it would be contacting all customers on standard variable tariffs to review their situation. The company is also introducing a new three-year fixed deal. "I know that price rises are never welcome, but the industry is facing significant cost increases," said EDF's chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz. "To be a sustainable and responsible business, we aim to make a fair margin in supplying customers. This fair margin allows us to invest for the long term, in particular in good service, innovation and smart metering." Five of the big six suppliers have announced price rises this year:	Energy firm EDF is raising the price of electricity for the second time this year for customers on standard tariffs.
Yves Jego has launched a drive on the Change.org website calling for vegetarian alternatives to be compulsory in all schools. More than 73,000 people have so far backed the petition. The move comes after a town in eastern France banned all pork substitutes in school meals last week. The conservative mayor of Chalon sur Saone had earlier launched his own campaign on Change.org, reiterating France's secular values. His campaign has gained 2,750 supporters. "Messages of support and of encouragement have come from every corner of France and from French people of all backgrounds, faiths and professions," the mayor, Gilles Platret, wrote. A court in the city of Dijon last week rejected an appeal against Mr Platret's intention to ban pork substitutes. "Can we force a Catholic child to eat meat on Good Friday because nothing else is proposed, or a Jew or a Muslim to eat pork?," Mr Jego asked in his petition, set up in response to Mr Platret's. He said he would propose a law if the petition received 75,000 signatories. France insists on the separation of religion and the state, and in 2004 introduced a ban on headscarves in schools. France has five million residents of Muslim descent, half of whom are under the age of 24. It also has the largest Jewish population in Europe. A secular solution to the problem of school meals was possible, said Mr Jego, of the left-wing Radical Party. The petitions have led to a debate in some quarters on the nature of secularism and what is ethically correct. "Secularism is not the denial of religions and beliefs, but the respect of all religions," wrote Houari Zeidouni, who signed Mr Jego's petition. But France's Agriculture Minister, Stephane le Foll, wrote in a tweet: "Supporting French livestock with vegetarian menus: that's Yves Jego's programme! Let's be consistent."	A French MP is campaigning for vegetarian school meals to be introduced to help pupils whose religions prevent them eating pork.
Media playback is unsupported on your device 24 February 2015 Last updated at 20:27 GMT The 67-year-old, who was fearful of returning to his Gateshead home after the attack in January, has begun house hunting thanks to an online fundraising campaign that attracted donations of more than Â£330,000. But Mr Barnes, whose collarbone was broken when he was knocked to the ground, told Look North's Peter Harris he was not yet ready to meet his attacker, drug-user Richard Gatiss, 25.	Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes has said he is "ready to move on with his life" after a man appeared in court to admit assaulting him.
Police said he was James Gunn, from Stromness. Mr Gunn's white Ford Focus crashed on the A967 at Garson Farm, Shandwick, on Saturday morning. Police have appealed for anyone who saw the car between Stromness and Twatt from 04:15 to 05:30 to come forward.	A 32-year-old man who died after his car crashed on Orkney has been named.
The Mediterranean gull and black-headed gull eggs were illegally harvested from from islands in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The theft has been branded "sickening" by bird charity Birds of Poole Harbour. The group said some eggs - sometimes eaten as a delicacy - were not cleared for human consumption. Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a "health issue". "I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening," he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.	Hundreds of eggs belonging to a protected species of bird have been stolen from an important nesting site, with fears they could be sold to the restaurant industry.
"We are about a third of the way down the road," she says. Having been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition. Her intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades. Given that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim. Sir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate. Roughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, around 50% of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50% do not. These absentees are her target audience. She says: "We should absolutely reasonably expect 75% of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tateâ€¦ and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift." Her clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in "an easier language to talk about the joy of art" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained. She talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, "it's not that we need to change anything particularly". There is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience. But if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.

Maria Balshaw wants to make the Tate "the most culturally inclusive institution in the world", which she thinks it is far from being at the moment.
There was no change of tone, no acknowledgement of any fresh message the voters had sent Mrs May, bar a passing reference to opportunity and fairness that echoed her speech on the same spot 11 months ago. It seems odd to me she didn't spend more of the election campaign talking about helping those who are "just managing" as she called them in her first (well-received) Downing Street speech. Her defiance extended to an insistence she would stick to the existing timetable for Brexit talks and her ambition produced the phrase "over the next five years". Perhaps she was just trying to steady the ship amid calls for her to resign. The Conservatives are notoriously ruthless with leaders who fail and I wouldn't put my mortgage on her still being in place for the conclusion of Brexit talks. Conservative MPs I have spoken to think she has done the right thing for now and that resignation would have increased the uncertainty with all the impact that would have had on financial markets. What does the loss of the Conservative majority mean for Brexit? That is harder to say. There is a growing argument that it means Mrs May will have to compromise more and go for a "softer" Brexit. But that ignores the sizeable numbers of Conservative and DUP MPs who favour a "clean Brexit" that would mean leaving the single market, the customs union and not paying into the pot after the UK has left. It also relies on the assumption that the remaining 27 EU countries are prepared to offer a choice of Brexit. In one of the most telling interventions of the election campaign, David Cameron suggested that the prime minister needed a large majority to prevent (rather than deliver) an "extreme Brexit". "It's so important," he said, "that the Conservatives win and win well, so Theresa can negotiate that Brexit deal, so she can stand up to people who want an extreme Brexit either here or in Brussels." A tiny majority - or no majority at all - would leave Theresa May having to secure a deal that would satisfy the likes of both Sir William Cash and Kenneth Clarke, a tall order in any circumstances. Unless Mrs May takes the advice of the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, who suggests she talks to other political parties to try to secure a cross-party consensus on what she called "an open Brexit". Ruth Davidson was one of her party's silver linings, leading the Conservatives to victory in 13 seats. Labour have pointed out that under 'English Votes for English Laws' those Scottish Tory MPs won't be able to take part in some Commons votes on health and education in England. That shouldn't affect the Conservatives' chances of winning votes in those areas as 46 non-Conservative MPs from Scotland would face the same restriction. As indeed would the new Tories' new friends from Northern Ireland. The Conservatives still have a parliamentary majority in England but its modest size means that controversial issues such as the expansion of grammar schools may struggle to pass through the House of Commons.	A visitor from another planet listening to the prime minister's speech outside No 10 on Friday could be forgiven for assuming nothing of significance happened the day before.
Ms Wood blamed the Conservatives in particular for claiming the SNP posed a threat to the future of the UK. She claimed "progressive" parties like hers were offering a "collaborative" alternative to "combative" politics. "This election presents an opportunity for harmonious co-existence between our nations," she said. Ms Wood's comments followed Conservative claims that Labour dependence on support from the SNP to form a government after the election on 7 May would threaten the break-up of the UK. Campaigning in south Wales on Monday, she said: "The parties advocating progressive, inclusive non-partisan cooperation in this election are not those who claim to cherish the political union above all others, but the national parties of Wales and Scotland. "Along with the Greens in England, our parties have provided people across these islands with a collaborative alternative to the traditional combative Westminster politics." Ms Wood added that she had received "hundreds" of supportive messages from people in England following the televised debates.	Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has accused rival parties of "dangerous and divisive rhetoric" in a "desperate" attempt to win votes.
UKIP is looking for a new leader following the shock resignation of Diane James, who had succeeded Nigel Farage after the EU referendum. MEP Steven Woolfe, who had been seen as the frontrunner, quit the party on Monday. He had been hospitalised after a "scuffle" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Coburn denied Mr Woolfe's claim that UKIP was in a "death spiral" and had become ungovernable. He said the incident between Mr Woolfe and Mr Hookem had been "regrettable" but had involved only two people rather than the whole party. Mr Woolfe has stood by his claim that he "received a blow" from Mr Hookem, though this has been denied by Mr Hookem. Mr Coburn said: "I keep saying it is country, party and self last. It is ideas that count, not individuals. What we are looking for is an agenda for the future, we are publishing it now and that is how we are moving forward. "Can I lead the party? Well, if I were asked by colleagues then of course I would do my best. But the thing is it is not about who is governing, it is to do with getting a group of people together, a collegiate group of people, who are going to run the thing." Mr Coburn said the party's libertarian politics meant people "can't be told what to do" but called on party members to "govern their own emotions and govern their own behaviour". He added: "What has happened is that we have had a charismatic leader for many years, who has kept a lid on things. "Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over." Mr Coburn, who is UKIP's only elected representative in Scotland, insisted there was still a reason for the party to exist despite achieving its core aim of having the UK leave the EU. He said he wanted to ensure the country was run "in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted "radical change" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU. And he said he would "certainly not" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit. Mr Coburn insisted: "We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom. "We entered as a United Kingdom, we leave as a United Kingdom. We voted as a United Kingdom, everybody knew that beforehand." Nominations to replace Ms James as UKIP leader close on 31 October, with the new leader announced on 28 November.	UKIP's Scottish MEP David Coburn has told the BBC he would "do his best" if colleagues asked him to stand for the party's leadership.
Ahead of the main procession, marchers and bands paraded around the city's historic walls. It is one of the biggest parades held in Northern Ireland and marks the anniversary of the ending of the Siege of Derry in 1689. Thousands of supporters from across the UK turned out to watch the 145 bands taking part. Having completed a circuit of the walls, members of the Apprentice Boys made their way to the Diamond for a wreath laying ceremony. A thanksgiving service, "to give thanks to God for the deliverance of the city," was then held at St. Columb's Cathedral. The memorial ceremony is held on the second Saturday in August each year, to commemorate the ending of the 105-day siege of the city in August 1689. Also known as William of Orange, or King Billy, the new monarch was supported by Protestants in Derry, who shut the gates of the walled city to keep out the advancing Jacobite army.	The annual Apprentice Boys demonstration has taken place in Londonderry.
The rare Tyrannosaurus bataar, 7m long (23ft), was bought by an anonymous bidder for more than $1m (Â£630,000) in New York. The sale went ahead despite protests from the Mongolian president. Elbegdorj Tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the Gobi Desert, came from Mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal. The auctioneers, Heritage Auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the Mongolian leader was put on the sale. Tyrannosaurus bataar is an Asian cousin of the meat-eating Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton in New York is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the BBC's Jonathan Blake in Washington. "When it comes to dinosaurs, number one, dinosaurs in general are extremely rare. But the rarest of the dinosaurs are the carnivores, the meat eaters - the top of the food chain if you will," David Herskowitz, director of natural history at Heritage Auctions, told APTV. "And, of all the meat eaters that are out there, the most famous are the Tyrannosaurids. They are the most desirable, but they are the most elusive. They are the most difficult to find. Even though they are so big, there are not that many of them around." Found about seven years ago in the Gobi Desert, the T. bataar remained in storage in England. The T. bataar was slightly smaller and had longer arms than its cousin, Mr Herskowitz said. This is the second Tyrannosaurid to be sold at auction, says Mr Herskowitz. The first was a T. rex named Sue sold in 1997 for more than $8m. Lawyers for the auction house say the sale did not break any US laws - but it will not be confirmed until it has been approved by a US court.	A row has broken out over the sale of a dinosaur skeleton at auction in the US.
Instead of The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother, viewers tuning in on 7 May will see "Darren", the man in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room. It is believed to be the first time a UK channel has closed on polling day. E4 is one of the most popular youth channels on television, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month. Its regular schedule will be suspended from 07:00 BST, when polls open, to 19:00 BST, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks (polling closes at 22:00 BST). Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: "Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day." A pre-election advertising campaign, running on all of Channel 4's stations, will alert viewers to the reason for E4's absence. The adverts will ask viewers: "How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show? "May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?" However, viewers will only be able to use the switch-off as an excuse to vote if they have already registered - and the deadline has already passed. Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an "alternative" to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell. Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: "Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter." David Mitchell added: "Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May." The show will also include special election-themed episodes of Gogglebox and The Last Leg. The BBC's coverage of the election will be anchored by David Dimbleby, while Tom Bradby presides over ITV's election show and Adam Boulton anchors Sky's coverage.	Channel 4 will shut down E4 on the day of the general election, in a bid to encourage more young people to vote.
It seems like only yesterday that the garages were locked and helmets hung up, as the sport emerges from one of the shortest winter breaks in its history. Lewis Hamilton's world title has barely had time to collect dust. The Mercedes driver and his winning team are this year's favourites too. Here's our guide to the 2015 season, with a little help from a former pit lane engineer. For the first time in five years, James Lyons will be watching the opening race at home with his dad. "I was senior electronics engineer at Marussia, I looked after everything from the lights in the garage to the control units in the car," explained the 30-year-old. James lost his job last November when the team entered administration. "I travelled the world but I won't be in the pit lane this time, I'll be sat on my mum and dad's sofa. It feels weird. "I'm really looking forward to the season." Alongside Lewis Hamilton, there are four other former F1 champions on the grid; Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen and Jenson Button. "I'm almost sure it will be either Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes to win the title this year," said James. "They're likely to run away with it." Fernando Alonso, who has switched Ferrari for McLaren, will not be in Melbourne after being advised by doctors not to risk a second bang on the head. His place at Ferrari has been taken by Sebastian Vettel. "With a better engine and aerodynamic package they (Ferrari) could pull it out of the bag this year." Red Bull's junior team, Toro Rosso, have handed 17-year-old Max Verstappen his debut. The Dutchman is the youngest driver in F1 history. Mercedes are the reigning constructors' champions after winning 16 of 19 races last season. Their advantage seems to have been maintained if pre-season is anything to go by. Williams, Ferrari and Red Bull will be competing just behind them. It's McLaren you have to feel sorry for. Engine problems have hampered them after teaming up with Honda at the end of last season. "The Honda guys have got a big job on their hands trying to get that engine up to spec because the other teams have had much longer to work on theirs," said James. The 2014 season was littered with off-track drama. Caterham and Marussia entered administration which led to hundreds of job losses, as James knows only too well. "We had a big meeting at the factory in Banbury and the administrator said, 'This is it, we're closing the doors.' "I was absolutely devastated." While Marussia are back this season under the new name of Manor Marussia, there are clues the sport's finances have not been fully repaired. More just patched up with some sticky-back plastic. F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has given struggling teams an advance on their prize money, but Sauber, Lotus and Force India have all suffered cash flow issues during pre-season. "If the TV money was shared out a bit better then small teams like Marussia would stand a better chance," says James. "Some of the bigger teams get more money than other team's entire annual budget." Since 2014, an F1 car's power has been provided by a 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 engine. In total, each driver is provided with 13 sets of dry weather tyres, four sets of intermediates and three sets of wet tyres across a race weekend. But bosses are keen to increase the sport's appeal around the world and there are plans to widen the cars and tyres and make the engines more powerful. Those plans have not yet been agreed on and James says he doesn't like the sound of them. "Maybe that'll win back some of the old crowd, but they can't go down the route of trying to make the cars look like they did in the early 80s and 90s." F1 fans have 20 races to look forward to this season, starting in Australia and ending in Abu Dhabi in November. Samantha Charles is studying in Sheffield and plans to get up early to watch the opening race in Melbourne. "I love the adrenaline and anticipation of watching a race," she said. "The politics of last season were really disappointing and I think more money needs to be put in so these smaller teams can compete." As for her 2015 hopes, he says: "I want Jenson Button to win, but I think Nico Rosberg has a great chance of beating Lewis Hamilton." While Samantha will be watching on the sofa, Ollie Zorab from Somerset will be in Melbourne. "I paid about Â£130 for my ticket - and they're the cheap seats," he said. "It's going to stand out for lots of reasons because the spectators are really part of the race and all the Aussies are fully behind Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) in his home grand prix. "Everyone's excited and looking forward to it." Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Formula 1 is back this weekend.
Gillian Triggs told a senate committee that she had been asked to resign and offered a new role. The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seeking an immediate investigation. The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention. Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law, and called for their release. Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC. "What she does is a matter for her," said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign. "As the secretary of the Attorney General's Department has made clear, she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered." On Tuesday, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report, saying that it was a "political stitch-up". Earlier in a senate hearing, Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis' department. "I rejected it out of hand," she said, as quoted by ABC News. Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department's secretary, Chris Moraitis, had said that she would be offered another job with the government. She added that she had been "very shaken and shocked" by the "disgraceful proposal" and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position. In a letter to the AFP commissioner, Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said: "The attorney general's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president, with the object of affecting the leadership of the [HRC] to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct." ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term "inducement" but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected. Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role. The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children, according to local media. He added that "as a matter of goodwill" he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities. The HRC report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was published earlier in February. It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment. The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott's government. He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed.	Australia's opposition Labor Party has asked police to investigate whether the government tried to induce the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission (HRC) to resign.
The inquiry was told Harry Clarke, 58, had been unconscious at the wheel of a bus in 2010 and during the bin lorry crash in December last year. Expert witness Dr Ronald Neville told the inquiry doctors did not note differing accounts of the 2010 episode. Mr Clarke told his GP he had fainted in the work canteen at First Bus. But the First Bus doctor was aware this happened while he was at the wheel of the bus. Six people died and 15 others were injured when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry veered out of control on Queen Street before crashing into the Millennium Hotel in George Square in December 2014. The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court is examining Mr Clarke's health, the condition of the lorry and the route taken. The court had previously heard that following the 2010 blackout when he was a bus driver, Mr Clarke was examined by Dr Kenneth Lyons, the medical advisor to First Bus. Dr Lyons subsequently sent a letter to Mr Clarke's own GP, which described how his loss of consciousness took place on a stationary bus and asked for further advice. Mr Clarke's GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, told the inquiry that the driver had said to him that he had fainted in the First Bus canteen. After he went on annual leave, Dr Lyons received a response to his letter from a Dr John Langan, who worked at the same practice as Dr McKaig. The letter said Mr Clarke had been "waiting for his lunch in a hot environment" when he fainted, and the driver was "unlikely to have another one". It concluded Mr Clarke was "fit to return to work as a bus driver". On Tuesday, the inquiry heard a second day of evidence from Dr Neville, a GP in Dundee, who also prepares expert reports on drivers' fitness to drive. He prepared a report on Mr Clarke after the bin lorry crash. Dr Neville told the inquiry that the "major discrepancy" in reports about the 2010 episode should have been caught by doctors. The expert witness said the letter that came back from Mr Clarke's GP's surgery lacked the detail or thoroughness you would expect from a healthcare professional. He said the First Bus doctor should have noted the major discrepancy in the account of the 2010 blackout and he should have got in touch with the other doctor. Dr Neville said that if either doctor had noted the discrepancy in Mr Clarke's account, an inquiry into the exact facts would have resulted. Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the bin lorry crash. Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. The Crown Office has already concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution over the crash, with senior lawyers deeming it a "tragic accident". The inquiry continues.	The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash which killed six people last year has heard of a "lack of due diligence" from doctors in relation to the driver.
Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the "ultimate" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was "very significant". "It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand," explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. "It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned." The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. "Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time," he said. "So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. "Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie." Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.	GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.
The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at four plants and will be stopped at two others later this week. The carmaker said the interruptions in production would affect 27,700 staff. "Although Braunschweig District Court has issued injunctions obliging the suppliers to resume deliveries, the suppliers have not as yet met their obligations. Volkswagen continues its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers," said the company in a statement. The two suppliers are CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which makes cast iron parts used in gearboxes. They are demanding compensation from VW because they say they their incomes were hit when VW cancelled a contract. VW says it is continuing its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers. The company said the production stoppage would not affect cars that have already been ordered. Any effect on future production will depend on how long the dispute lasts. Some production has already been halted at Wolfsburg, which makes Golfs, and at Zwickau where Golfs and Passats are made. Production is due to begin again later this week. Production has also stopped at Braunschweig, which makes chassis parts and plastic parts, but should start again next Monday. Later this week, production will cease at Salzgitter, which is involved in engine production, and Kassel where transmission and exhaust system production takes place. In what the company said was an unrelated issue, production was halted at Emden, which makes Passats, last week and will resume on Wednesday. In some cases employees have been sent home, in others they are engaged in short-time working on other jobs within the plants. The German Economy Ministry on Monday called on VW and the suppliers end the dispute. "We assume and also expect the companies to solve the sticking issues as soon as possible," Economy Ministry spokesman Andreas Audretsch told journalists during a regular news conference. He added: "It is about thousands of jobs, which could be affected by shorter work hours, and the responsibility to tackle these problems constructively is very high." VW in the UK issued a statement in which it said the company was "working intensively on minimising the acute supply risk, the priority being to maintain production in some areas and to ensure that deliveries can be made to customers. "Volkswagen currently expects to be able to adhere to all confirmed delivery dates," it added.	Volkswagen has halted production at several plants in Germany, hitting the output of Golf and Passat models amid a dispute with two external suppliers.
Three others were injured, one seriously, in the incident at Downsview Park, medical officials said. The collapse happened an hour before the gates were due to open for the concert, with queues already beginning to form outside. UK rock band Radiohead tweeted that the performance had been cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances". Emergency crews went to the scene and the area was evacuated. Toronto police said the stage collapsed at 16:00 local time (20:00). Police said the person who died was a man in his 30s, but did not reveal his identity. The victims were all part of a team involved with setting up the stage, officials said. Alexandra Halbert, who was working in a beer tent at the show, said she was about 200-300 yards away from the stage, with her back to it, when she heard "something that sounded like fireworks". "I turned around and the whole top part of the stage had collapsed, as well as the scaffolding," she told the BBC. "It seemed like there were a couple of minutes of hesitation and no one knew quite what to do. It was only afterwards that we all realised how serious it was." Jason Ip, a food vendor, said there was "chaos" as people waited for the emergency services to arrive. "A few people started running towards the stage. No one knew exactly what had happened, but it was clear that people were underneath the stage," he said. "It was like witnessing a car accident. In a situation like that, you just aren't sure how to react." Some 40,000 people were expected for the sold-out gig, which was also due to feature Canadian musician Caribou.	One person has died in a stage collapse before a Radiohead concert in the Canadian city of Toronto.
The University of Essex study of 712 Italian-American mafia members in the 1960s showed their income had risen by 7.5-8.5% per extra year of education. Those involved in complex crimes such as charging exorbitant rates for loans or extortion saw three times the boost of those who committed violent crimes. But, on average, the 712 left education a year earlier than other white men of a similar age in their neighbourhoods. "Criminal careers are known to start very early and are likely to be interwoven with schooling choices," the study says. Lead researcher Prof Giovanni Mastrobuoni said education tended to have a protective effect against getting involved with crime, but he added: "It is also true that if you decide to be a criminal it's better to be a better-educated one." The study says: "Private returns to education exist not only in legitimate but also in the illegitimate activities that imply a sufficient degree of complexity," "Mobster returns (in terms of income) to a year of schooling are around 7.5 to 8.5%, compared to 9-10% for the neighbour sample. "Moreover, for mobsters who, according to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics records, were involved in white-collar crimes that require running an illegal business (ie racketeering, loan sharking, bootlegging et cetera) we found returns to education that are about three times as large as for those who are involved in violent crimes (ie robberies, murders et cetera)."	Mafia criminals who are better educated tend to earn more, research suggests.
The British Embassy in Rabat said Roger and Mathilde Lamb from Pensham, near Pershore, died in separate falls. A spokeswoman said Mrs Lamb fell from a window of an apartment in the resort of Essaouira while Mr Lamb fell downstairs at a different building a few days later. They both died in hospital. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said the exact circumstances of the deaths were being investigated. The FCO is providing consular assistance to the family. In a statement, the couple's families said they were "deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths". The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira. Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives. He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday. "We heard first of all that he was badly injured. And then on Monday we heard that he had died," he said. Mr Lamb, who was an engineer and a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was working in Christchurch, New Zealand, while his family remained at home in Worcestershire. The families said their main concern was for the couple's children. "Roger and Tilly's families have been deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths while on holiday in Morocco," the statement said. "Our principal concern at the moment is to provide love and support to their four sons who have had to suffer the loss of both a mother and a father in swift succession. "The boys are being well cared for by relatives. "We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the British consular authorities in Morocco for their invaluable assistance." The mayor of Pershore, John Grantham, said people who knew the couple had been saddened by the news. He said: "They're clearly very upset, it's been quite a shock." Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, had relatives in Wiltshire. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police confirmed that her body was being repatriated to the county.	A couple from Worcestershire have died on holiday in Morocco.
Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances. When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media. His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president. When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards. Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky. Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK. Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death. Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption. He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as "prisoners of conscience". Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges. Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail. Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred" after performing an "anti-Putin punk prayer" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal. Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012. Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence. Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences. Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin. Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres. But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents. Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium. It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin. Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011. Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists. Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority. Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as "negligible". Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

The body of Louis Thornton, 26, who played for Douglas-based Corinthians, was discovered at 05:20 BST on Saturday in his hotel room in James Street. Club treasurer Steve Corran said Mr Thornton, who had been on Merseyside to watch his beloved Middlesbrough play Everton, was a "big character" and a "leader, both on and off the pitch". Mr Thornton's death is not being treated as suspicious. In a statement, Corinthians said everyone was welcome at the club to pay their own tributes. Mr Corran said: "We would like people to come and visit the pitch where our Louis scored great goals, scruffy goals, put in crunching tackles, but most of all has given his family, team-mates, managers and fans so many memorable moments." Mr Thornton worked for an accountancy business in Douglas. Mr Corran, who was also his boss at work, said: "He worked hard and gave 100% in everything he did on and off the pitch."

The bank said profits before tax not including those settlements dropped 10% to £1.43bn for the July-to-September period. The result comes a day after the bank confirmed Jes Staley would be joining as its new chief executive. Barclays said it had seen slow progress with its so-called non-core businesses, which it is selling. Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to £337m. Barclays provided £270m to settle claims in the US over mortgage bonds and £290m to compensate clients over bad foreign exchange rates. For the businesses the bank plans to keep, including its UK High Street bank and Barclaycard, profit rose 1% to £1.76bn. Including the £560m hit, and other costs and gains the bank considers to be one-offs, third-quarter profit before tax fell to £861m from £1.22bn a year ago. Revenues dipped to £6.1bn from £6.4bn for the June-to-September period. On Wednesday, Barclays announced that Mr Staley will be joining the bank as its new chief in December. Mr Staley currently works for US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management, and previously has worked for JP Morgan. Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. Mr Staley will be paid £1.2m in salary, £396,000 in pension contributions and as much as £5.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares. He will also receive £1.15m in shares per year that he will have to keep for five years before cashing in. That is a total of £8.2m for the year, if he is awarded the maximum bonus. He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about £1.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses. Analysts said this could include such areas as merger advice and trading in stocks.	Barclays has reported a fall in third-quarter profits and set aside £560m for more customer refunds and litigation.
The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. Sales jumped from €9.4bn to €10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of "extending the service to other countries". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: "Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop." Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's "online drive" was important. "I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important," he said. "And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. "So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories." The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.	Profit jumped at Zara owner Inditex in the first half of the year as the firm opened new stores and invested in online.
The Potters' record signing, who arrived in January, powered home to give the visitors a half-time lead. Ibrahim Afellay struck a sweet second for Stoke, and substitute Joselu made it 3-0 two minutes later. Matt Ritchie responded immediately for the Cherries, but his left-footed strike proved to be a mere consolation. Media playback is not supported on this device It was Stoke's first away win in 2016 and only their second league victory in seven attempts. Mark Hughes's side move up to ninth in the table, five points off the European places, while Bournemouth remain 15th and four points above the relegation zone. Relive Stoke's win over Bournemouth Follow reaction to Saturday's games Stoke had been on the end of three consecutive 3-0 defeats in the league, and had failed to get on the score sheet for a month. But they looked clinical from the outset at the Vitality Stadium, even without Marko Arnautovic and Bojan in the side. Frenchman Imbula, who signed from Marseille for £18.3m on transfer deadline day, opened his Stoke account in only his second appearance by racing onto the ball and thrashing home. A superb counter-attack led to their second, as the impressive Jon Walters held the ball up before feeding to Afellay, who swept home his first ever Premier League goal. And only moments after coming on for the injured Glen Johnson, Joselu grabbed a third with a rising header after a pinpoint ball from Xherdan Shaqiri. Bournemouth enjoyed 62% of the possession in the first-half but failed to really test Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland - bar a looping effort from Charlie Daniels. Benik Afobe had scored three in five games since joining from Wolves in January but looked out of his depth at times, and only managed two touches in the box during the first 45 minutes. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe brought on Scotland international Ritchie for the second half, along with Josh King, and the wide pair made a huge difference going forward. Ritchie scored with a clinical effort from the edge of the box, and he almost grabbed a second from King's ball in, as Stoke struggled to cope without injured defenders Johnson and Marc Muniesa. But eventually the Cherries faded and they were unable to pull off an unlikely comeback, leaving them with back-to-back league defeats. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "They were quite compact and deep and I thought they were very respectful of how we played and the first moments of the game I was expecting us to have a really good afternoon but the goal seemed to change the game. Media playback is not supported on this device "I think the quality of their goals was really high and their first goal was a great strike, their third goal was very well worked but their second goal was the one I think we are really disappointed with." Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "It was a really pleasing away performance, we came here with a good game plan. "We conceded a bit of possession, more than we usually do but we felt we could get good opportunities on the break. With the personnel that we have got we could cause Bournemouth a problem."

A San Francisco judge has placed January's executive order in limbo, but the White House is vowing to appeal. San Francisco and Santa Clara County sued in February. The Trump administration has warned so-called sanctuary cities they could lose federal funds if they do not co-operate with federal immigration officials. On Tuesday, Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction against the presidential order as the case continues in the courts. "It's the 9th Circuit going bananas," White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, in reference to the San Francisco-based appeals court, which conservatives often accuse of liberalism. Mr Trump's measure cast doubt on the transfer of some $1.2bn (Â£940m) for San Francisco and $1.7bn to Santa Clara County, home to many Silicon Valley communities. It is another legal defeat for President Trump in his efforts to curb immigration - his plan to curtail travel from seven Muslim-majority nations was twice blocked in federal courts. Lawyers for the federal government had argued in the sanctuary cities case that only funding related to law enforcement would be withheld. But Judge Orrick said any doubt about the scope of the "vague" order was erased by public comments made by President Trump, such as those calling the measure a "weapon" to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies. He accused the Trump administration of a "schizophrenic approach" to the order. The 49-page court ruling added that the plaintiffs challenging President Trump's order are likely to succeed in proving the order unconstitutional. "Federal funding... cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves," the judge wrote. However, Judge Orrick's ruling allowed the justice department to follow through with threats made to nine cities last week to cut specific programme grants if they do not adequately co-operate with federal immigration officers. In a press release last week, the department accused sanctuary cities of "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime". There are several sanctuary cities across the US, including Mr Trump's home of New York. New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Tuesday's ruling, saying the president went beyond his authority to cut funding to cities that "don't share his illogical and unconstitutional desire to scapegoat immigrants". Trump starts a 'sanctuary city' war with liberal America	The White House has labelled "bananas" a ruling that blocks President Donald Trump's order barring funding for cities that shelter illegal immigrants.

The state newspaper says the "suave" liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, despite boasting 30%-40% alcohol. The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called insam and glutinous rice, and cultivated by an organic farming method. North Korean media is known for making often outlandish claims about its domestic achievements. Last year, it said medical products containing extracts from the insam plant could cure Mers, Sars and even Aids, NK News reported. The Pyongyang Times said the new alcohol "exudes national flavour", without dampening your national fervour the following morning. Among its other unique selling points, according to the paper - the spirit "is highly appreciated by experts and lovers". The newspaper article, titled, "Liquor wins quality medal for preserving national smack", says the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory has been working for years on the elixir. The drink derives from Kaesong Koryo insam - a natural herb thought to have medicinal properties. According to the Pyongyang Times, replacing sugar with the scorched, glutinous rice removed the bitterness from the insam and, crucially, the hangover. "Koryo Liquor, which is made of six-year-old Kaesong Koryo insam, known as being highest in medicinal effect, and the scorched rice, is highly appreciated by experts and lovers as it is suave and causes no hangover," the article reads. The liquor "has already been registered as a national scientific and technological hit", it adds. Andray Abrahamian, who travels to North Korea on business for Chosong Exchange, told the UK-based North Korean News website that insam liquors were "OK"  but he is "not that keen on it as a tasty treat". "There are some high quality liquors made in North Korea, though in my experience there is no such thing as hangover-free booze anywhere in the world," he said.	North Korean scientists have invented a hangover-free alcohol, according to the Pyongyang Times.
Goalkeeper Manny Agboola, 18, will be on the bench after being recalled from a loan spell at North Leigh. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is likely to make changes again, as he did in the last round against Birmingham. Striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (knee) and midfielder Jack Colback (illness) could return. Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford: "If we beat Newcastle, it would probably be as big a win for me as I've ever had as a manager. "I remember being manager of Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round and we went to Arsenal and became the only team to beat them in a FA Cup tie at the Emirates. "That was some achievement as we probably spent about 80% of the game on the back foot. But for me, if Newcastle were in the Premier League right now, they'd be a top-10 team. "They've got a fantastic manager, are a great club with a winning mentality and with fantastic support behind them." Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez: "We knew we had to make changes [in the last round against Birmingham] because we have so many games. "It is important to win, but using the squad and not taking too many risks with players was important. This competition is always difficult, but we will try to go through. "When you play against any team at this stage, especially away from home, it gives them extra motivation."	Oxford United could hand a debut to striker Toni Martinez after his loan move from West Ham, but forward Chris Maguire (thigh) faces a fitness test.
The children's laureate - always a well-known writer or illustrator of children's books - is chosen by a panel of judges from the book world. It comes with a bursary of Â£15,000, not to mention a shiny, silver medal. The role has a pretty loose job description - the laureate has to "promote and encourage children's interest in books, reading and writing". Jacqueline Wilson's "obsession" while she was children's laureate was to "get everyone to read aloud to children, all children, from the age of nought to 11". Malorie Blackman revealed that she spoke to over 20,000 teenagers when she was in the role but arguably her main achievement was setting up the UK's Young Adult Literature Convention, which now takes place each year as part of the London Film and Comic Con. Chris Riddell has spent much of his two years defending school libraries and librarians, and promoting the art of illustration at live events. In his final speech before he passes on the baton, he said the lack of investment in school libraries is a "blight on the intellectual development and creative future of all our children", as well as highlighting the issues faced by child refugees in the UK. Quentin Blake, the first children's laureate and best-known for his collaborations with Roald Dahl, produced a book called A Sailing Boat in the Sky in collaboration with 1800 French-speaking schoolchildren.

The body was found near Heanor Memorial Park in Derbyshire. Derbyshire Police originally thought the man was 17-year-old Han Lan, but now believe it might be a 21-year-old man named Trung Thanh Hoang. The inquest also heard police think he may not have died at the park but that his body was dropped off there. Police officers are working with Vietnamese authorities to confirm his identity and to find relatives either in the UK or in Vietnam. The inquest at  Derby Coroner's Court heard it was believed the man visited a nightclub in Birmingham on Christmas Eve before returning to an address in Derby after feeling unwell. The cause of death is yet to be established but a toxicology report showed high levels of a number of drugs in his system. Police are still treating his death as suspicious. The inquest was adjourned until the end of March.	The identity of a man found dead in a car park on Christmas Day is still not clear, an inquest into his death has heard.
Chapelcross, near Annan, is one of five sites being considered but is the only one north of the border. Capenhurst in Cheshire, Sellafield in west Cumbria and Aldermaston and Burghfield, both in Berkshire, are the other possible locations. The consultation was at the Victoria Halls in Annan on Friday. Councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who chairs the Chapelcross Site Stakeholders Group, said it was important as many people as possible took the opportunity to examine the proposals and express their opinion. The UK government has pledged that public opinion will be taken into account in deciding the final location. Consultation will run until February around all the locations on the shortlist. Ministers are planning that waste from nuclear-powered Royal Navy submarines which have left service would be stored at one of the sites until "some time after 2040" when the UK's deep level underground waste dump is available.	A final consultation event has been held on proposals to use a former Scots nuclear plant to store radioactive waste from redundant submarines.
The man named as Abdalfatah HA is suspected of being part of a unit with an al-Qaeda-linked group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which killed 36 Syrian government employees in 2013. The federal prosecutors' office said the man, arrested in Duesseldorf, had carried out death sentences. A second suspected al-Nusra fighter was arrested in the town of Giessen. Abdulrahman AA is accused of breaking international weapons laws. Both are thought to have been part of the same combat unit for al-Nusra, which was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria at the time. The group formally severed its ties to the global jihadist network last year, renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. In January, JFS merged with four smaller groups to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. German prosecutors allege Abdulrahman AA, 26, and Abdalfatah HA, 35, took part in an armed battle against Syrian government troops including taking over a big arms depot near Mahin, central Syria, in November 2013, eight months after the murders of the government employees. Some local reports have claimed one of the men was an asylum seeker, but a spokeswoman for the prosecutors' office refused to confirm this.	A Syrian national has been arrested in Germany accused of war crimes involving the murder of dozens of civil servants.
The demonstration came after the deaths of several helpers in recent months. They also called for a pay rise, a limit on working hours and better accommodation. Eman Villanueva, spokesman for the Asian Migrants Co-ordinating Body, told the South China Morning Post:  "We are hopeful that our demands will be met." He added: "There are no reasons to reject them unless this is an anti-immigrant government." Early last month, a 35-year-old Filipino domestic worker fell to her death as she was reportedly cleaning the windows of her employer's flat. At least four other helpers are reported to have died this year from work accidents or suicide. "Cleaning windows from the outside is not a domestic worker's duty. It's a responsibility of the building management," said Mr Villanueva, himself a domestic worker from the Philippines. "It's necessary to have proper training and safety equipment to do that sort of job." The protest also called for a rise in the minimum wage for foreign domestic workers to HK$5,000 (US$645; Â£485) a month. The minimum wage is currently HK$4,210 per month, and employers are required to provide "suitable accommodation" as well as free food or a food allowance. The South China Morning Post quotes a study by the non-profit Justice Centre which suggests the average domestic worker in Hong Kong works nearly 12 hours a day, and nearly 40% did not have their own room. Mr Villanueva said there were domestic workers living in "boxes" similar to "dog houses".	Domestic workers have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to demand a ban on them being asked to clean windows in high-rise buildings.
I was a little surprised by all the fuss. On the whole, it has to be admitted though, that India is no stranger to comical brand names. Millions of men across the nation have marched into drug stores and asked for Manforce condoms. Meanwhile, housewives have purchased Stay On power capsules for their husbands, in the hope that they will. We've been using Cock brand fireworks for years. However, this does not mean that people from elsewhere can mock us. Every nation is home to some unfortunately named products. If you live in England, you should know that your nation produces Heinz Microwavable Spotted Dick, and has been doing so for many years. Somebody must be buying it. Your finer supermarkets stock Original Breast Munchies, which can also be ordered online. Meanwhile, people in Ghana are eating their French fries with Shitto sauce and washing it down with Pee Cola. You don't hear them making a fuss about it. So what if the Indian car name sounded similar to a lethal virus? Who are you to judge us? Rather than indulging in unnecessary mudslinging, this is a good opportunity to review the history of brand names in India, to see how we arrived at Zica. You could even argue that it's important, because the history of these names, and their evolution, is in some ways the history of a nation's soul. Our story begins in 1947, at which point we thought we were free. But it was not that easy. The British proved to be extremely hard to get rid of. Many of them lurked in the clubs, refusing to let others in. Others strode the chambers of commerce like colossi, until we plied them with gin and dragged them away after they fell to the floor, unconscious. When we were young and vulnerable as a nation, their malign influence was strong. Our favourite brands were biscuits and beverages, the sort which khansamas (cooks) served to their memsahibs, like Bournvita and Thin Arrow Root and Horlicks. Time has passed, but the shadow of the Raj has lingered. As we grew in confidence, we bought Indian-sounding Mysore Sandal Soap and Rooh Afza Syrup and Taj Mahal Tea, but a Raymond's suit was still better than a Dinesh. Sometimes this rising confidence could breed unfortunate hybrids, like the Premier Padmini. It was an automobile launched in 1974, and marched us boldly into the 1950s. The only thing Indian about it was the Padmini. Padmini was also the name of a popular actress, who shot through our lives like a comet, and dominated the dreams of many adolescents. As a boy I remember being highly embarrassed that our car was called a Padmini. As we breezed into the 70s and 80s, still oddly confident, we felt strong enough to challenge the might of Coca Cola, and came up with Thums Up, as a result of which almost no one in India can spell the word "thumb". Another local champion of the time was the Vijai Super Scooter, which ran on a mixture of petrol and kerosene, and sometimes made farting noises. All this gave you the national perspective, but there were also regional peculiarities. In my native Bengal, most brands have always been edible. Food is a big priority, perhaps because history has taught us that you never know when it will run out. My childhood was dominated by brands like Dulal's Palm Candy, Ganesh Brand Mustard Oil and Jalajog Sweet Curd, which was endorsed by poet Rabindranath Tagore: "After eating Jalajog Sweet Curd, I was extremely pleased." Gastronomical and pharmaceutical go hand in hand, which is why stomach remedies like Gelusil, Digene and Pudin Hara are also part of our sub-national psyche. As we moved into the 90s, the rest of the country, not as obsessed with stomachs, broadened its horizons. We remained convinced that foreign was better than Indian, but our definition of foreign expanded beyond Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus. We embraced brands that sounded like they were foreign, such as Monte Carlo from the city of Ludhiana, Da Milano from Kapashera (near Delhi), and La Opala from AJC Bose Road in Kolkata (Calcutta). An emerging subculture or subroutine was the "might be Japanese" category, with names like Onida and Okaya leaving just enough room for doubt. In this way, gradually, we got to know the world. We now live in a bold new era, where old rules are meaningless and assumptions are questioned. Products of today have rejected the tyranny of grammar and logic. I live right next door to a Kutz and Kurlz, and there are several Bathroom Shoppees within walking distance. The decision of Tata Motors to call its new car Zica has to be viewed in this socio-cultural and grammatical context. It was a bit of a boo boo, no doubt, but contextually correct. There is no need to worry. No harm will come of this. Tata Motors manufactures fine products, as do all the other manufacturers mentioned in this article. Whatever name they choose to give their new vehicle, it will surely smell just as sweet. Besides, we should not be so hasty in criticising names. We speak in many tongues. All names are open to interpretation, including our own. In India, names like Chokalingam, Vellasamy and Terry Mardi are perfectly acceptable in some parts of the country, but raise a wide variety of questions in others. So try not to rush into judgment. Just be grateful your name is not Anal Singh. Shovon Chowdhury's latest book, Murder With Bengali Characteristics, is set in a Calcutta occupied by China.	There was a minor sensation in India recently when Tata Motors launched a car named Zica.
A fire crew remains at Plasgran in Manea Road, Wimblington, more than 16 hours after the incident began on Wednesday afternoon. Road closures are expected to stay in place until midday, the fire service said. About 75 firefighters worked into the night to put out the fire. They also prevented its spread to neighbouring properties. The incident was scaled down at 2300 GMT, when the fire was brought under control.	An investigation has begun into the cause of a fire which has severely damaged a plastics factory in Cambridgeshire.
27 January 2015 Last updated at 14:30 GMT They show that the asteroid has its own small moon orbiting it. The asteroid passed by the Earth at a safe distance of 1.2 million km, giving scientists a rare chance to study it 'up close'. The new data shows that asteroid 2004 BL86 is about 325m across, and its moon is around 70m wide. Now that it has passed Earth the asteroid will continue on its orbit around the Sun, and it won't come this close again for another 200 years! The next 'close shave' of a large asteroid is due in 2027: that object is called 1999 AN10 and is just over 1km wide.	New pictures of asteroid 2004 BL86, which passed close by Earth yesterday, have been released by US space agency Nasa.
Ayoze Perez, Chancel Mbemba and Dwight Gayle scored in a comfortable victory, but it was Jack Grealish's 89th-minute goal which sealed the Magpies' title. Perez's flicked finish made it 1-0, before Mbemba smashed in to double the lead from a Perez rebound. Gayle added a late third before Grealish's goal handed them the title. It was a comfortable win for Rafael Benitez's side - yet it looked like it would not be enough to seal top spot, after Glenn Murray's penalty had put league leaders Brighton in front at Villa Park. However, despite being down to 10 men following Nathan Baker's red card, Grealish beat Brighton keeper David Stockdale to send the Magpies above Brighton in the table. At St James' Park, DeAndre Yedlin terrorised Barnsley down the right-hand side and it was his cross which Perez guided into the bottom corner to open the scoring. Christian Atsu forced Barnsley goalkeeper Adam Davies into two strong diving saves with powerful shots and Massadio Haidara smashed a good chance over the crossbar from Perez's cut-back as the hosts dominated. Davies kept out Jack Colback with his legs, but the Magpies got a deserved second when Davies pushed Perez's shot out perfectly for Mbemba to smash home his first goal for the club. Jonjo Shelvey struck the post before Aleksandar Mitrovic's header sent substitute Gayle through to complete the scoring with a confident finish past the onrushing Davies. Under manager Benitez, Newcastle brought 12 players to the club after dropping into the Championship last summer, with Matt Ritchie and Gayle moving down a division to sign five-year deals. With more than £50 million spent in transfer fees alone, the Magpies were under pressure to achieve promotion - a feat they managed with two games to spare. Benitez's side have battled with Brighton throughout the season for top spot, but since the Seagulls achieved promotion on 17 April they have dropped off the pace dramatically. Ultimately it is three straight wins for Newcastle and three matches without three points for Chris Hughton's side that has told, giving the Toon the perfect end to the campaign. Match ends, Newcastle United 3, Barnsley 0. Second Half ends, Newcastle United 3, Barnsley 0. Yoan Gouffran (Newcastle United) wins a free kick in the defensive half. Foul by Saidy Janko (Barnsley).

Kiel Hauley, 33, Jonas Marcius, 23, and Adrian Morley, 33, deny assaulting and murdering Craig Grant, of Inverurie, outside the Galleria shopping centre in August last year. Witness Shaun Wheeldon said he saw Mr Grant being held on the pavement. He said he was "shocked" to see Mr Grant's face was light grey. Mr Wheeldon told the High Court in Aberdeen he could see two men restraining Mr Grant on the ground outside Tonik and stopped to speak to a bouncer. He said:  "He just said he had been in the club and he was highly drunk." Mr Wheeldon said there was "quite a commotion" outside the bar with a lot of people standing outside. Advocate depute James Keegan QC asked: "How did you react when you saw his face?" He replied: "I was shocked at the colour of him. He was light grey." Mr Keegan asked: "When you saw the colour of him what did you think?" He replied: "That he was in a bad way." He said Mr Grant's friends were trying to intervene when police arrived at the scene because he had shown no response on the ground. He told the court police took over and tried to sit him up. He said: "They sat him up like a teddy bear. It wasn't a recovery position." Mr Keegan asked: "When you say a teddy bear what do you mean by that?" He replied: "Because he was limp." The trial continues.	A man was limp "like a teddy bear" after he was restrained by bouncers on the ground outside an Aberdeen bar, a murder trial has heard.
Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica suffered a partially severed right hand in a rally accident on the eve of the 2011 season and has not recovered enough movement to return. "I miss racing in F1, yes," he said in an exclusive BBC Sport interview before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. "When you do everything you can to be an F1 driver and suddenly it stops, it's not painful but it's definitely not something you were looking for." Media playback is not supported on this device The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery. He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers. "I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash," the 28-year-old said, "but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level, although not any more in F1. "Driving F1 would not be such a big problem, the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now. "The problem in F1 is the space. Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider, I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice. "What is important for me is I am seeing progress. Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand, [but] driving I see the progress, in the rally car, in the simulator. "The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really doesn't matter if it will take one month, one year or 10 years, maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again." Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010, was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash. He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle. But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport, he said: "I think more. I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1. "I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries, the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital, you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport." He added: "I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price, that's for sure. "It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept. If you are driving you are not thinking about this. If you don't accept, you don't do it." Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery. He said: "What I learned is that because of my situation I cannot look too much forward. I have to look week after week, day after day and move forward, that's the most important."

Sexist, racist and homophobic remarks were being used by pupils against school staff, as well as offensive comments about appearance, the NASUWT said. There were also examples of parents being abusive on social media, it added. About 60% of 1,500 teachers questioned in a poll said they had faced abuse, compared with 21% last year. In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. In another, pupils used the name of a heavily pregnant school worker to post insults, the teachers' union said. Of those who had been subjected to insults, nearly half (48%) said these remarks were posted by pupils, 40% said they were put up by parents, and 12% said both parents and pupils were responsible. Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. More than half (57%) of pupils responsible were aged between 14 and 16, and 38% were 11 to 14, the teachers' poll found, with a fifth aged 16 to 19 and 5% were seven to 11. Among the examples published by NASUWT was the case of a student uploading a teacher's photo and then, along with classmates, writing insults underneath. One teacher had been harassed for nine months by students who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in the teacher's name. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment "I hope she gets cancer", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks. Another school worker faced comments from a pupil's family member about how they looked and that they were ugly. Chris Keates, the union's general secretary, said: "It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. "Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse. "The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and well-being, and undermining their confidence to do their job."	More teachers are facing abuse on social media, warns a teachers' union.
The personnel will assist in the temporary relocation of some staff from the US embassy in Baghdad. Fighters from the militant Sunni group ISIS have seized a number of Iraqi towns and cities in the past week. Separately the US says it is willing to discuss with Iran what measures can halt the advance of the ISIS rebels. However correspondents say that American officials have been quick to dismiss reports of military collaboration. Speaking on Monday to Yahoo News, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Washington would "not rule out anything that would be constructive" while emphasising that any cooperation with Iran would be conducted on a "step-by-step" basis. The UN says that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) rebels have carried out hundreds of summary executions. Human rights chief Navi Pillay said that systematic killings in the north of the country "almost certainly amounted to war crimes". Her remarks came as the militants, led by ISIS, were reported to have seized the strategic city of Tal Afar. Heavy fighting is also reported in Baquba, the provincial capital of Diyala province, on the north-eastern approaches to the capital. Rebels are reported to have taken over several quarters and captured the main police station, seizing many weapons. The rebels occupied several key cities last week, but some towns were retaken. Security in Baghdad has been stepped up after the insurgents threatened to march on the capital. The White House statement said that the main role of the 275 military personnel will be to help embassy staff to relocate to US consulates in Basra and Irbil. It added that 100 personnel would provide airfield management and security. "These US military personnel are entering Iraq with the consent of the government of Iraq," the statement said. "The US embassy in Baghdad remains open, and a substantial majority of the US embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place and the embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission." American officials quoted by the AP news agency have said that there is also a possibility of a limited special forces mission being deployed to train and advise demoralised Iraqi troops, although such a move has not yet been been given the go-ahead. Reports meanwhile have emerged that an army helicopter was shot down in fierce clashes near the city of Falluja, located just 70km (45 miles) west of Baghdad. Ms Pillay's comments came after Sunni militants posted photos online appearing to show fighters massacring Iraqi soldiers. In a video circulated online, ISIS fighters were also seen taunting captured troops with threats of decapitation. The Iraqi military earlier said the pictures were real, but their authenticity has not been independently confirmed. The US condemned them as "horrifying". The insurgents' lightning advance began last week with their capture of the cities of Mosul and Tikrit. Fighting in Tal Afar began on Sunday, with mortar shelling of some districts as the militants tried to enter the city in Nineveh province. Tal Afar, which has a mixed Sunni and Shia population, lies between Mosul and the Syrian border. The city of 200,000 people was taken just before dawn on Monday, Mayor Abdulal Abdoul told the Associated Press news agency. Eyewitnesses said militants in pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns and flying black jihadist banners were roaming the streets as gunfire rang out. But the government insists it still largely controls the town and that ISIS fighters would be swiftly dealt with, says the BBC's Jim Muir in northern Iraq. The prime minister of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region has told the BBC he doesn't believe the country will stay together. Nechirvan Barzani said it would be impossible for Iraq to return to the situation that existed before Sunni militants took control of the city of Mosul last week. The government on Monday said it had "regained the initiative" against an offensive by Sunni rebels. The defence ministry released footage on Monday which it said was of air strikes on ISIS targets north of Baghdad, including on Mosul and Samarra. The US earlier announced it might use drone strikes to halt the ISIS advance. The USS George HW Bush aircraft carrier has already been deployed to the Gulf, accompanied by two more warships. Britain reiterated on Monday that it had no plans for military intervention in Iraq. Iraq 'Massacre' photos: What we know	Up to 275 US "military personnel" are being sent to Iraq to provide security for the US embassy in Baghdad and other personnel, the White House says.
Gabriel Sakellaridis was speaking after Mr Tsipras won the late-night vote convincingly, but with more than 30 of his own MPs voting against him. The vote means the government lost its majority but is expected to survive. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the vote in a conference call. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed a €7bn (£5bn) "bridging" loan to help Greece pay debt interest due in several days. Live updates Under the terms of the bailout deal agreed in Brussels on Monday, the first tranche of legislation relating to tax and pensions had to be passed by Wednesday. The Greek parliament discussed the bailout deal beyond a midnight deadline into Thursday morning. Mr Tsipras won the vote by 229 votes to 64, with the support of some opposition MPs. See how events unfolded here The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says he has been weakened and will now need a reshuffle or a vote of confidence. Passionate opposition came from his own party, with parliamentary Speaker Zoe Constantopoulo calling the measures "social genocide". Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was another vocal opponent of the measures. Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package, prompting speculation they could lose their jobs in a reshuffle. In his address to parliament Mr Tsipras said: "I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them." He added: "The Greek people can understand the difference between those who fight in an unfair battle and those who just hand in their weapons." He also said it was a "positive development" that one of Greece's creditors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had suggested that the bailout does not go far enough - and that some debts will need to be written off. Mr Sakellaridis said the vote was the first important step towards a deal and hinted that the government would try to remain in office despite losing its majority. "The basic priority of the prime minister and the government is the immediate and successful completion of the agreement," he said. When Eurozone finance ministers hold their conference call at 08:00 GMT they will discuss the next steps. Later, the European Central Bank's governing council will meet to discuss how to keep Greece's banks from collapsing. Greek banks have been closed for more than two weeks to reopen, with cash withdrawals limited to €60 a day. For Greece to secure its new funds, it must win the approval of the domestic parliaments of several of the other 18 members of the eurozone. Germany is expected to vote on the deal on Friday. Greece must also commit to a major overhaul of the civil justice system by 22 July and agree to more privatisation, to review collective bargaining and industrial action and to make market reforms, including Sunday trading. Thursday morning's vote approved: Opponents of the bailout measures took to the streets of Athens in mainly peaceful protests ahead of the vote. One group threw petrol bombs at police officers who responded with tear gas. Unions and trade associations representing civil servants, municipal workers and pharmacy owners also went on strike on Wednesday.	Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is focused on completing a €86bn bailout deal agreed with the eurozone despite setbacks in a crucial vote to push through tough reforms, his spokesman has said.
The two-time major winner last won at the Tournament of Champions in January 2016. Spieth carded a seven-under-par 65 in the third round to move to 17 under. Fellow American Brandt Snedeker (67) is second on 11 under, one ahead of Dustin Johnson and Kelly Kraft, who shot 66s. Spieth started the day in a share of the lead with world number one Jason Day and American Derek Fathauer on 10 under. Australian Day had a disastrous start with three bogeys and a double bogey in his opening six holes as he fell away with a three-over 75, while Fathauer signed for a 74. Spieth meanwhile was delighted with a return to form with the putter as he rolled in eight birdies, five on the back nine. "I hit my lines," the 23-year-old told Golf Channel. "It's been something I've been struggling with this year. "I've been striking the ball really well but my third and ninth place finishes were off of very average putting on strokes gained."	Jordan Spieth is on course to win his first PGA Tour title in over a year as he takes a six-shot lead into the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
The UK stage of the race comes to the city on 7 July. Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature "Tour jerseys" and wool-covered bicycle wheels. Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was "interested", he said. A similar "mini-jersey" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race. The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them. "It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more," Mr Wagon said. "The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'. "I think knitting is in Cambridge's DNA," he added. Mr Wagon, a cycling skills and bicycle maintenance trainer from Outspoken Training in the city, said he was a fan not only of the Tour de France, but the cultural activities surrounding it. "It isn't just a bike race. Its history is all about promoting your town and region and that's something we can do. "The world's eyes will be on us and it's a chance for us to show that Cambridge can do things slightly differently, and perhaps slightly oddly," he said. A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, Mr Wagon said. A cycle shop in the city has also offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations. He said he was discussing suitable places his knitted bunting might go, with the city council.	A man who admits he "cannot knit a stitch" is hoping to cover the streets of Cambridge with knitted bunting and wool artwork during the Tour de France.
Prof Simon Wessely, said he was "genuinely surprised and incredibly honoured" by the award. He now heads the department of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London. He became interested in "medically unexplained symptoms and syndromes" early in his career, and studied chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - or ME. In 1991 he was involved in setting up one of the first NHS clinics for people with CFS symptoms and in the mid 1990s, he started to investigate Gulf War Syndrome. This disputed condition had been linked to personnel who served in the first Gulf conflict in 1990-91. Reported symptoms ranged from chronic fatigue, headaches and sleep disturbances to joint pains, irritable bowel, stomach and respiratory disorders and psychological problems. Prof Wessely has said there may not be a distinct illness. He said: "Gulf War Syndrome is a misnomer," he said. "Rather it's an illness or health effect. "We established something happened, but we found no specific cause. "The fascinating thing is that it didn't happen again in Iraq, and the reason for that remains enigmatic." Prof Wessely continues to study the long-term effects on those now serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he said that there had been improvements in the mental health care for armed forces personnel and those close to them. "There is now improved psychological support, particularly for reservists and families." He was among a large number of researchers, charity workers and NHS staff to receive honours. Other health experts recognised included Stephen O'Brien, Chair of Barts and The London NHS Trust, who also receives a knighthood. Respiratory health expert Prof John Britton and Caroline Shaw, chief executive of Manchester's specialist cancer hospital, The Christie are among those made CBEs. One of those is Caroline Shaw, who is appointed a CBE for her work running The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester. A former midwife, Ms Shaw was one of the youngest female NHS chief executives when she took over at the Christie in 2005. She said: "I am incredibly proud... It is such a huge honour to be recognised in this way for my work in an industry I believe in and care passionately about."	A leading researcher into the mental health of military personnel has been knighted in the New Year's Honours.
Media playback is not supported on this device Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar. Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached. Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal. The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends. Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four. County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post. The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked. Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods. Hartley's side are now in pole position to secure a place in the top six for the season run-in.	Dundee leapfrogged Ross County and moved into the Premiership's top six, prevailing in a hugely entertaining Dens Park encounter.
Umpires Ian Gould and Richard Illingworth, the former Worcestershire and England slow left-armer, made several inspections. But the previous day's incessant rain had left an already wet outfield totally sodden at New Road. Overnight frost on the covers also led to melting ice dripping onto the pitch. The two sides still hope to get underway promptly on Monday morning (11:00 BST). Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason: "We can't do anything about it. It's one of those things that is out of our control. "We have given the ground a good chance to dry out today and it has not quite done it. Player safety has got to come first." Kent captain Sam Northeast: "It's extremely frustrating. After four weeks of preparation in pre-season, we get to the first day and we are unable to play and the sun's out as well. "The boys are raring to go, so it's pretty disappointing. We hoped for the best but looking at the ground this morning, we knew it was going to be tough to get on."	Worcestershire and Kent spent a frustrating first day of the new County Championship season before play was called off in mid-afternoon.
The prime minister "is committed to free school meals in England", an official spokesman told the BBC. The coalition government introduced the meals a year ago for all pupils in the first three years of school in England. But there has been speculation the meals are at risk, after Chancellor George Osborne demanded cuts of between 25% and 40% from unprotected budgets. The spokesman said the prime minister had made the point that "it was in the manifesto, the manifesto words are very clear - we're proud of what we've done with free school meals". The Conservative manifesto says: "We will support families by providing free meals to all infants". The chancellor called for the cuts in July, as part of his spending review, due to be published in November. The free school meals budget has cost about Â£600m each year, and there had been speculation over its future. But the Department for Education has indicated that free school meals will be protected in the spending review. "We believe that every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities," said a spokesman. "That is at the heart of what we are doing with school food. "No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime. "We have provided significant financial support to schools to help them deliver universal infant free school meals. "We have come a long way, and the new School Food Standards mean pupils of all ages are eating good food that sows the seeds for healthy eating for life." At the weekend some 40 top health professionals signed a letter warning that scrapping the meals could harm children's health. "It would be short-term thinking indeed for the government to cut the funding for universal infant free school meals," said the letter. The National Association of Head Teachers called for "a swift and unequivocal statement" from government that it would honour its general election pledge to fund a meal for all infant children. "That message could and should be delivered straight away," said NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby. "Schools signing contracts with catering companies this term can't afford to wait until the November spending review only to find out the policy has been changed."	David Cameron has dismissed speculation free school meals for all infant children could face cuts.
Ceredigion-based Lewis Coaches, which runs buses from Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Carmarthen, is to shut on Friday. The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru said 40 jobs were at risk. Ceredigion council said it was working to continue some services. The authority said plans were already in place to see the on-demand Bwcabus service and the 588 and 585 routes from Aberystwyth University to Lampeter taken over by other firms by Saturday. But the council said it understood the 701 Aberystwyth - Carmarthen - Cardiff service would end on Friday and it did not know if another operator would take it on. Lewis Coaches is the third bus company in Wales to collapse in the past two months, with 300 jobs lost when Wrexham-based GHA Coaches went into administration in July and Pembrokeshire firm Silcox Coaches, ceasing trading after 134 years in June.	Some bus services in mid Wales facing the axe because the firm which runs them went into administration could be maintained, a council has said.
Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to £1,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to £100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the "feelgood factor". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry £11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to £6,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have £390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to "tell Sid" about the chance to buy shares at "affordable" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called "Big Bang", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.	During her years as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher revolutionised the economic fortunes of every person in the UK.
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme. GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character". Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients." The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June. Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had. "They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform. "If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them." Find out how to get into taekwondo in our special guide.	The brother of Wales' double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones has been signed up by the sport's Great Britain academy.
Salvador Sobral's success with Amar Pelos Dois (Love for Both of Us) has made him a national hero. Wearing a plain black suit he delivered an emotionally charged song without the theatrics that often accompany other Eurovision acts. Previously Portugal had never got above the sixth place that it reached in 1996. It was a triumph for "brand Portugal", music journalist and advertising executive Manuel Falcao told the BBC. "The Portuguese language is present worldwide but sometimes it's hard for the national identity to make an impression, so for the brand this is very nice - people are very happy," he said. The timing was fortunate for Portugal, as the nation shows signs of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and a massive bailout from its eurozone partners. "Polls show people are more optimistic here than three years ago, the economic indicators are not strong but positive - even by EU standards," Mr Falcao said. Eurovision success "coincided with a good mood in Portugal - we won the Euro 2016 football championship and tourism here is beating all records", he said. He cautioned, however, that one song would not make a radical difference. It was a doubly memorable weekend for Portugal, as Pope Francis drew a vast crowd to the Fatima shrine, where he made saints of two Portuguese children. Their visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 turned Fatima into a top Catholic pilgrimage site. There is national pride that Sobral's song Amar Pelos Dois touched so many hearts, in a competition dominated by English lyrics. "The language, more than the Portuguese language, was music," Sobral said. The song was crafted by his sister Luisa, an accomplished singer-songwriter and music college graduate, with several CDs to her name. A fellow Portuguese music expert, Sofia Vieira Lopes, said the song's triumph proved that lyrics were not fundamental to a musical message. "It shows that it's not necessary to sing in English to understand the music," she told Portugal's Publico daily. Salvador Sobral criticised the commercialisation of pop, after his Saturday night triumph in Ukraine, speaking contemptuously of "fast-food music". "This is a vote for people who actually mean something with their music," he said. "Music is not fireworks, music is feeling." The state tourism authority, Turismo de Portugal, is thrilled by the boost to the country's image. "We are in the spotlight," its president Luis Araujo told the daily Diario de Noticias (DN). He characterised the winning song as "simplicity, transparency, honesty". The melancholy, bittersweet lyrics include the lines: "My darling, listen to my prayers / I beg you to come back, come back to love me / I know we can't love alone." There was a poignancy to Sobral's performance, as he has struggled with a serious heart condition. His success shows there is still a market for national musical traditions, despite the dominance of Anglo-American pop culture. Portugal requires broadcasters to observe a quota of Portuguese-language songs. France and Spain have similar quotas, to showcase home-grown talent. Even before the Eurovision final Sobral's song was hugely popular in Portugal, Mr Falcao said. Yet English remains the default pop language, even in Portugal, he said. And Salvador Sobral himself has recorded covers of American hits - in English.	Portuguese are celebrating the fact that an intimate love ballad in their language conquered a Eurovision song contest audience for the first time.
Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a "very, very strange year at Uber". In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship. It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho "bro" culture. But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley? Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon. According to a 2016 survey, 60% of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances. The "Elephant in the Valley" survey found that 87% of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues. Almost 40% of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. "I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate," one contributor to the study wrote. "He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his 'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company." Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. "After that, I was never asked to travel with him again," she said. "This impacted my ability to do my job." The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. On Twitter, Ms Pao said Ms Fowler's blog post shows "the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies". Sexist van slogans banned in Australia Meet the female gamers challenging sexism Are universities secretly sexist? Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out. Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years: Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem. Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41% of women had experienced it; and about 40-50% of women in the EU, according to the United Nations. Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60%. The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19% of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services. The same study found that, across all industries, 30% of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were "bossy", "aggressive" or "intimidating". In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84% of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation). The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that. In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. Facebook has pledged to give $15m (£12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code. 31–33% of the three biggest tech brands' employees are female - but what about their actual technical staff? 19% of Google's tech workforce is female, compared to 31% within the whole firm 23% of Apple's technology staff are women - and 32% of its global total, including retail 17% of Facebook's technology team are women, it says - and 33% of all its staff And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest $150m (£120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from $115m in 2014. At the moment, 23% of Apple's tech employees are women. At Google, it's 19%. And at Facebook, just 17%. Change comes slowly in companies of this size, so the path could be a long one. But by broadening the pool of people qualified to work there, Silicon Valley is hoping to change the status quo.	Taxi-hailing app Uber has promised an "urgent investigation" into claims of workplace sexual harassment, after a female engineer said misogyny was rife at the firm and women were quitting in droves.
Sally Chidzoy said she was targeted after raising concerns when an MP appeared to convince a senior colleague to drop one of her stories. She further alleges she was "falsely imprisoned" by management during an attempt to seize her phone. Ms Chidzoy also claims she was sexually discriminated against and victimised. The tribunal in Cambridge was told Ms Chidzoy, who works as BBC Look East's home affairs correspondent, had been investigating East of England Ambulance Service boss Anthony Marsh's salary package. She said the story was dropped after assistant editor Steve Silk received a late-night email from then-Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb in July 2014. Sent from a private account, it noted Mr Lamb's "real concern about the potential damage" the story could have on the service. Giving evidence, Ms Chidzoy said she had discovered a "very close" relationship between Mr Lamb and Dr Marsh and she felt the MP was "attempting, in my view, to stop a broadcast". "He should not be doing this and leaning on the BBC and its duty to be impartial and independent. "[It was] a direct attempt to interfere with an ongoing piece that had not yet been broadcast." Representing the BBC, Sophie Belgrave disputed the suggestion Mr Silk had been influenced by the email, saying he would have done it in a "clandestine" way had this been the case. She said: "If he was going to give in to political interference from Norman Lamb on the sly, they would just do it." Disciplinary proceedings were launched against Ms Chidzoy after she raised the issue of the MP's interference and after an email from Mr Lamb to Mr Silk was leaked to a Sunday newspaper. Bosses subsequently attempted to seize her phone and "falsely imprisoned" her at a meeting in September 2014, the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said she investigated another story about the Centre for Business and Public Sector Ethics, which was receiving money from the Chinese government. She was informed BBC Look East editor Nikki O'Donnell was the "organisation's press spokesperson", the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said: "The problems I encountered involved what I believe is internal corruption and poor management." She also alleges she was subjected to a covert investigation by ex-Met police officers at the BBC investigation unit while the proceedings were ongoing. The tribunal continues.	A BBC TV reporter was the victim of a "witch-hunt" after blowing the whistle on political interference, a tribunal has heard.
The 19-year-old woman was attacked between 20:30 and 21:00 on Wednesday. Officers cordoned off an area of the park as part of their investigation, and were believed to be following a positive line of inquiry. Anyone with information was asked to contact Police Scotland.	Police are investigating the rape of a woman in Queens Park in Glasgow's Southside.
The official violated the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) ban on political gestures. Belarus' neighbours Russia are banned from the Games following state-sponsored doping. "A hero has appeared amongst us," said Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry. "This is the person who showed solidarity with people who were disgracefully treated in an inhumane way in not being allowed to compete at the Paralympics," Zakharova told Interfax news agency. The official, identified by Russian media as Andrei Fomochkin, has had his accreditation for Rio cancelled by the IPC. IPC head of media Craig Spence said: "I'd like to thank the media for ensuring there was a picture of the individual on Twitter pretty quickly. We managed to locate that individual and confiscate the flag pretty much within 20 minutes of the flag being displayed. "It's seen as a political protest because he carried a Russian flag when he's in the Belarus delegation, and when you've got the president of the Belarus National Paralympic Committee being so vocal in the media before these Games saying he disagreed with our decision, then it's a pretty easy conclusion that it was a political protest. "We check all teams before they go out into the stadium at every single Games, so that flag was pretty well hidden on that person because all of the Belarus team was searched before they went out and the flag was somewhere on the person that we didn't notice." Fomochkin has received support from Belarus for his gesture. "This was the right thing," Dmitri Mironchik, press secretary for Belarus's Foreign Ministry, told RIA Novosti. "If we need to answer for these gestures, then we will answer."	A Belarus official who carried a Russian flag into the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games has been banned from the competition.
The New Zealand fighter failed to impress against the Romanian who took the bout at two weeks' notice, winning a 119-108 117-110 117-110 decision. The champion landed sporadic flurries throughout but never looked like scoring a stoppage in Auckland. He has said he will campaign overseas, with Britain's WBA and IBF champion Anthony Joshua a potential opponent. Though he remains unbeaten in 23 fights, the manner of this win may make Parker a tougher sell for pay-per-view audiences overseas. The 25-year-old - who claimed the vacant WBO belt against Andy Ruiz in December - did land some shots when in close to Cojanu but when at distance he looked incapable of finding ways to rock a man three inches taller and around two stone heavier. Cojanu, who now has 16 wins and three losses to his name, was one of Parker's sparring partners but stepped in to the main event when Britain's Hughie Fury withdrew through injury. Cojanu landed a left hook of his own in the 10th round and chased a stoppage win in the 12th. But, in truth, he always looked occupied with spoiling Parker's work, most notably when having a point deducted for leaning on the champion's neck in the fourth. Parker said afterwards: "You can all see why we bring Razvan into camp for us. He put on a great fight. "I've done my best to keep fights here in New Zealand but it's down to us to go and get some exposure overseas now."	Joseph Parker defended his WBO heavyweight title for the first time in a drab points win over Razvan Cojanu.
Files were found after the attacks on a computer dumped in a rubbish bin, a well-placed source confirmed. The computer also included a final message from one of the airport bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui. Belgian authorities have identified all 32 victims who died on 22 March. Seventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care. The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack. The computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode. In his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore. Copies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US. Brussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed. A temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity, Chief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt "from the air conditioning to the check-in desks". Several airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing €5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport. In a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough. They complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's "open infrastructure" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.	Jihadist bombers who attacked Brussels airport and metro last week also collected building plans and photos of Prime Minister Charles Michel's office and home, the BBC has learned.
Humberside Police, said Darren Lee Barton was assaulted outside the Rutland Arms on Saturday. He was taken to the Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby after the incident at about 18:00 BST, but died on Wednesday evening. Nathan Newland, 27, appeared before Grimsby and Cleethorpes Magistrates' Court on Tuesday charged with section 20 wounding and producing cannabis. He was remanded in custody until 22 August when he is due to appear at Grimsby Crown Court. Police said a post-mortem examination had yet to take place to establish the cause of death.	A 46-year-old man has died after he was attacked outside a pub in Grimsby.
The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43% possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: "It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. "We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes." South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: "Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. "We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side."

Belmont, a Grade II* listed building in Lyme Regis, has been restored following eight years of research and two years of restoration work by the Landmark Trust charity. It was owned in the 18th Century by Eleanor Coade, who built up a successful artificial stone business. The building will open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Dr Anna Keay, director of the Landmark Trust, said the rejuvenated building was "a fitting monument to the genius of Eleanor Coade". She added: "Visitors will now be able to stay in her Georgian architectural gem and in so doing experience the beauty and peace that inspired one of our greatest modern writers, John Fowles." Belmont was Fowles's home for almost four decades from 1968, and it was where he completed his classic novel The French Lieutenant's Woman. The Landmark Trust's craftspeople have recreated any damaged or missing items at their studio in the Cotswolds, such as fireplaces, architraves, shutters and skirting boards. Coade stone was a ceramic, synthetic stone that was first produced during the 18th Century. Like the trust's other 195 buildings, Belmont will be let out for short breaks.	A Georgian seaside villa in Dorset, where author John Fowles lived, will open its doors after a £1.8m revamp.
This hard-fought-for policy united local political parties, but doubt now hangs over it. There are several reasons why. Firstly, although the legislation is in place, it needs a final green light from government. The Northern Ireland Executive must demonstrate its finances are on a sustainable footing. Does a potential £490m blunder over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme undermine that? This is, perhaps, arguable. We are talking about finding £20-30m a year for 20 years to cover an RHI overspend, a small part of a £10bn annual block grant. But the crisis has put other hurdles on the horizon. The Northern Ireland Assembly must pass a rate recommended by the finance minister in the year before it applies. How soon will there be an executive or assembly the other side of an election? And will there then be a greater reluctance about paying for corporation tax with a £200m cut to the block grant? Any return to direct rule from Westminster might not offer an immediate solution either. European Union state aid rules apply until Brexit and they only allow devolution of corporation tax to a region which has "institutional autonomy". It is premature to pronounce Northern Ireland's big economic idea as dead. But in the here and now, things look mightily challenging - can Invest NI promote a rate and a date to overseas companies with any certainty? Even before the political crisis, some experts felt 2018 was ambitious anyhow for companies to adapt to new rules. And all the while, the main UK rate of corporation tax is falling, blunting the attractiveness of what Northern Ireland wants to offer.	Northern Ireland's political crisis could kill off plans to cut corporation tax to 12.5% in April 2018.
To the strains of the late reggae star's One Love, Mr Obama was shown around the sprawling house in Kingston that was Mr Marley's final home. The US president said he was a fan of the musician, telling his museum guide: "I still have all the albums." Mr Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. But his first stop after landing in Kingston was the old Victorian-style house in central Kingston that Mr Marley called home between 1975 and his death in 1981. Mr Obama spent 20 minutes in the museum, which now houses artefacts from the singer's life including gold records and his Grammy Lifetime Achievement award. His arrival aboard Air Force One on Wednesday made him the first sitting US president to set foot in the country since Ronald Reagan visited 33 years ago. He was greeted by Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the US Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno. Mr Obama will meet representatives of the 15 countries in the Caribbean Community group on the three-day trip to Jamaica and Panama, and is expected to discuss energy and security issues.	Barack Obama has taken a tour of the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica after becoming the first US president to visit the country since 1982.
Olly Martins said the force, which has to save Â£7.5m over the next two years, spends Â£3m a year on its buildings. But changes in policing technology meant officers could now share facilities, he added. The Police Federation said it would be concerned that officers in shops may look "unprofessional". Mr Martins said many of the county's police buildings were in need of refurbishment and no longer in the best position to serve the public, while others were under used. An online public survey opens on Friday to asses residents' views. The survey answers will help gauge support for replacing some stations with more accessible facilities in public areas such as public buildings and supermarkets. The PCC said operational policing was already running at maximum efficiency, so he must look to other areas. Changes to modern policing due to the use of technology, meant "innovative ways of increasing access to the police while reducing overheads" could be considered, he added. "In the future officers will be able to carry out much of their communications and administrative tasks while on the move, which reduces the demand on premises and increases their visibility," he said. He said no decisions had been taken yet but "tough choices" needed to be made. Ray Reed from Bedfordshire Police Federation, said he was not resistant to change, but "had concerns" over response times and perception. "People already complain about response times and if you close down stations it will make things worse," he said. "Plus I would be worried about how police would be perceived in supermarkets, it may look unprofessional. "And [in public buildings] there is a risk element as you may get someone becoming aggressive in full view of the public. "[Police carry out] sensitive functions in the community and we have to think how and where we place them."	Some Bedfordshire police stations could be relocated to supermarkets to help bridge a funding gap, its Police and Crime Commissioner said.
The changes come as part of what the police force has called the "biggest shake-up" in policing in years. The PSNI said the teams will "deal with community problems" and give "advice". The first LPTs to launch will be based in Lurgan and Armagh city police stations in County Armagh. They will be supported by four mobile neighbourhood policing teams (NPTs). The roll-out of all 26 LPTs is expected to be completed by 1 October. Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said policing in Northern Ireland is in a process of "transformation" due to "significant budget pressures" and new council structures. He said "normal policing will carry on" and the new teams will respond to calls, conduct investigations, and "deal with community problems". "They will provide advice and reassurance and spend time learning about what most affects communities in order to work with them to improve safety and quality of life," he said. The 34 NPTs, which will be based in areas with higher levels of crime and deprivation, are to be set up with the aim of providing "an additional dedicated policing presence, reassurance and commitment to communities where it is most needed". ACC Martin said restructuring means the number of police stations currently in existence is under review. "The reality is that nearly all policing services are delivered outside of stations," he added. "Policing isn't about buildings it is about officers working with the community in the community."	The Police Service of Northern Ireland has started to phase in local policing teams (LPTs).
This time the poll was held under a new constitution, designed to prevent a repeat of that violence when more than 1,000 people died when supporters of rival candidates clashed. They have been choosing a president, members of parliament and senators, the new posts of county governors and members of county assemblies. The presidential contest is seen as a two-horse race between Prime Minister Raila Odinga against Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta. BBC correspondents around the country sum up how the voting went. The queues in some places stretched for more than a kilometre, as voters in Kibera stood patiently in line. The neighbourhood is one of Nairobi's largest slums. It is the constituency of Raila Odinga, one of the favourites for the presidential contest and the scene of some of the worst violence following the last election in 2007. Today, many had arrived before dawn, waiting patiently in line, sometimes for hours. Voters cast their ballots into colour-coded boxes - six each - for a variety of different representatives, local and national. The memories of five years ago are still fresh and, as the campaign drew to a close, a sense of apprehension was palpable. Police talked of conspiracies to cause chaos and warned that violence would be met in kind. But, in Kibera at least, as the sun grew hotter and the umbrellas came out, the mood was up-beat. "Peace, peace," one crowd shouted as a truck of paramilitary police trundled past. We came across a man with dreadlocks and a pot of white paint. His message, "Peace wanted alive", can be seen daubed on walls and roads around the neighbourhood. The real test of peace, though, is likely to come once all the ballots have been cast, and the results start coming in. As the sun begins to set, the heat is easing and some polling stations are still open after the official closing time of 17:00, with queues of people determined to cast their vote. Tensions have been running high in this insecure and arid region near the Somali border and there has been a heavy security presence at the polling stations - with between five and 10 armed police officers on guard. On Sunday night one people died in an explosion and another person was shot dead in what is believed to be election-related violence. Some people began queuing at 05:00 - an hour before the polls opened. But there has been frustration in the long queues, with some buying water to pour over their heads to cool themselves down and others sitting under umbrellas. The biometric voter ID systems have not worked at the polling stations in this north-eastern town so electoral officials have had to resort to the manual voters registers. The computerised fingerprint and facial identification was introduced after the last election to prevent fraud. This slowed the whole process down, as has the fact that about 60% of voters have needed assistance to cast their ballot as they are illiterate. One woman with a baby on her back told me that after waiting until she got to the front of the queue, she found her name was not on the roll, even though she had a voter registration card. Hundreds of people ended up giving up. One man who could not find his name after lining up in three queues over 12 hours told me he was going home without voting. In the centre of Mombasa many people lined up from 05:00 to ensure their place in the queue and avoid the sweltering temperatures that characterise the coast. A cluster of white gazebos went some way to protect the early voters from the sun and the six colour-coded ballot boxes that sheltered beneath. Nearly half a million voters are registered in Kenya's second city, with another half a million making up the surrounding counties. This is historically "opposition" territory but under the complex arithmetic of the presidential vote, the candidates cannot afford to ignore this part of the country. Many voters queuing patiently described it as an "historic day" - the first time Kenyans are voting under a new constitution. But further along the coast, election day was marred by technical hitches and sporadic violence in a handful of flashpoints. Faulty biometric voting kits caused delays in Mombasa West. In Changamwe, half an hour's drive from the city, four police officers were hacked to death with machetes by a gang, who the authorities claim were members of the separatist Mombasa Revolutionary Council (MRC). The group had urged voters to boycott the polls in protest at what they see as the marginalisation of Mombasa, but few seemed to heed that call. The crowds outside Changamwe's main polling station had swollen to several hundred by midafternoon: Women with their babies strapped to their backs and men with beads of sweat running down their brow, seemingly undeterred by the attack that took place shortly before polls opened. Many people in the crowd outside Changamwe Social Hall which was turned into the local polling station seemed unconvinced that the group was to blame. Kenya has had a long history of violent elections and areas deemed to be opposition strongholds like this, are used to what people describe as "powerful forces" seeking to scare people away from the polls. But this time there is a palpable determination to prove to the world that Kenya is on a new democratic path. A whistle stop tour by the new Inspector General of police to the "scene of the crime" helped to provide reassurance in what has otherwise been a peaceful poll. Too busy tweeting to vote? Q&A: Kenya’s 2013 elections In pictures: Kenyan elections There were also disturbances in the town of Kilifi, where two civilians were among six shot dead. Although the violence that flared up was in isolated areas, it got Khalef Kalifa from Muslims for Human Rights anxious.As an election observer he said police seemed "ill prepared" for any clashes and that in some polling stations computers were not working and "in one polling station a voter had to come and show the presiding offer how to use the computer". But election officials promised voters they would keep the polling stations open to compensate for earlier delays. By the time the evening call to prayer could bear heard echoing out from the mosques of Mombasa, Festus Mwanzia was number 27 in the queue.  He had waited patiently in line for nearly 12 hours. "I'll be home by 10," he chirped confidently. "Just in time to catch the results on TV." Many people here know the biggest test is yet to come once the tallying gets under way. In the western town of Eldoret, the provincial capital of the Rift Valley where much of the post-election violence occurred following the December 2007 election, voting started early in the morning with enthusiastic voters arriving as early as 05:00. There were long queues, some stretching for a kilometre. At the MV Patel polling station which has the highest number of registered voters in the region, people complained that the process was too slow. In Shinyalu, in the rural Kakamega district - between Eldoret and Kisumu - the area's former member of parliament, Justus Kizito, was ambushed in the early hours of the morning and his Range Rover was burnt to ashes. He says the attack was political and forced to flee for fear of his life before the mob set the vehicle on fire. At Kosachei Primary School near Eldoret, William Ruto, a suspect at the International Criminal Court from the Kalenjin community and running mate to presidential candidate and fellow indictee Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, cast his vote at 07:30. Afterwards he told me that should their Jubilee coalition win, they would co-operate with the ICC in the hope of clearing their names. The two, who were rivals during the last poll, both deny charges of orchestrating the violence following the 2007 vote. At the Kiambaa polling station - just a stone's throw from the ill-fated church where more than 40 Kikuyu people who had sought shelter there were burnt alive on 1 January 2008, when it was set ablaze by a mob of armed Kalenjin youth - most voters were happy to have cast their ballots in peace. Paty Chelegat, a Kalenjin mother of two, told the BBC: "There is peace in Kiambaa area and indeed the entire Uasin Gishu county and my joy is that I have voted peacefully and [I am] hoping that all will be well even after the results are announced." Peter Kariuki, a father of four, said despite losing his relatives in the Kiambaa church fire, he is encouraged with the prevailing peace existing among the various communities that used not to see eye to eye. "I am very happy because this vote is a new beginning to residents of Kiambaa and Eldoret," he said. I was awoken in this lakeside city, a stronghold of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, at 02:15 by people blowing vuvuzelas - their alarm call to get people down to the polling stations early. By 04:00 - two hours before the polls opened - thousands of people were already queuing. There was a little tension at one polling station when it did not open on time and voters forced the gate open, but officials restored order and voting began. Women with babies or who were pregnant were able to get to the front on the winding line. At one polling station a woman stuffed a baby blanket under her dress so that she could pass for pregnant and be given priority to vote, but her belly ruse did not work. After that women in the slum of Kondele were asked to breastfeed their children to prove the offspring are theirs in order to jump the queues. Kondele, where there are high rates of unemployment, has a history of electoral violence with rival local politicians often using youths to cause trouble. A 56-year-old man in Kondele told me it was the first time he had ever witnessed a peaceful election in the slum. Mr Odinga's Cord alliance has been urging people not to drink alcohol and on the eve of the vote most bars in Kisumu were closed. The majority of businesses have also been shut today and after voting people followed advice to go home instead of hanging around in groups to watch the proceedings. It is hard to believe given the huge crowds earlier on but electoral officials in Kondele were already tallying the votes just an hour after the polls were due to close at 17:00. After being counted, the ballots will be taken to a central place in the city before being transferred to Nairobi. People came out in huge numbers to vote, some queuing in the chilly morning from 03:00. There were complaints about the slow process of casting the six ballots, but voters remained jovial. "I've waited five hours - I can wait 50 more," one man told me. "I will not leave before voting, come rain, sun, hunger or sleep." Nakuru is a cosmopolitan area, though it turned into an ethnic battle field between two rival communities, the Kalenjins and Kikuyus, after the last election. "We will redeem the image of Nakuru, what happened in 2007 will not happen again. We have learnt our lesson," a 29-year-old woman told me. Some people travelled long distances to vote, one man at the Afraha stadium - where the line was twice the length of a football pitch - had returned home from Uganda where he works. The biometric ID systems malfunctioned at most polling stations, which caused delays. One person, who joined a queue at 03:00 eventually voted at 11:00 because he was searching for his name on the paper voters' register - it was only at the front of the third queue that he was eventually successful. Despite the delays, everyone got a chance to vote and polling stations closed as planned at 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Most people have returned home, to follow the counting process on TV or radio. The usually busy city centre is deserted, with no cars or pedestrians. Even the curio stalls popular with tourists coming to see the flamingos at nearby Lake Nakuru are closed. I came across only one restaurant that is open. Trucks full of police can be seen patrolling everywhere in this town - an agricultural centre in the Rift Valley. But people I spoke to say they do not expect any violence once results come out, as efforts to achieve reconciliation between communities that were pitted against each other after the 2007 election have been successful.	Kenyans have been voting in a key election - the first since the disputed contest of December 2007 that triggered weeks of bloodshed.
Whilst on patrol over Winnipeg, the chopper's crew accidentally turned on its loudspeaker allowing members of the public below to hear them. Those listening say they heard pilots swearing and discussing oral sex. Winnipeg Police Service say some of the "conversation was inappropriate" and have promised an internal review. Brandi Armstrong told CBC news that she had been sitting in her garden on Monday evening as the helicopter flew over and was shocked by the exchange. "My jaw hit the ground; eyes bulged out," she said. She added that she would like to see the pilots punished. The police say that they are considering disciplinary measures. Another resident walking near the city's legislature building overhead a different, expletive-laden discussion about money. The officers were unaware that the loudspeaker was on due to the noise from the helicopter's engine. Residents listening below began to tweet to the city's police department as the pilots continued talking.	Canadian police have apologised after an explicit conversation was inadvertently broadcast from one of its helicopters.
However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. "My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog." He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. "There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way," he explained. "We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel." It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. "I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level," he said. "A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. "I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there." Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. "They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones," he said. "It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. "That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. "I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common."

Local authorities can apply for funds to support weekly collections, as well as for initiatives offering residents reward vouchers for recycling rubbish. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who announced the scheme last autumn, calls weekly bin collections a "basic right". But Labour's Hilary Benn says the funding would be better spent on children's centres and elderly care. Mr Pickles scrapped guidance telling councils to introduce fortnightly collections in a bid to reverse a trend developed under Labour. He will say later that rubbish collections are the "most visible service" paid for through council tax. "Labour's barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik's cube," he will say. "The public are fed up of all the bin dos and bin don'ts. They just want a simple service." The government scheme will make funding available for facilities with technology that sorts waste after it has been picked up, preventing families having to sort rubbish into as many as nine containers. More than half the councils in England collect refuse once a fortnight, although many pick up recycling or food waste on a weekly basis. However, BBC local government correspondent Mike Sergeant said there was no compulsion to bid for a share of the cash. "Having invested heavily in alternate weekly systems, some may be rather reluctant to go back," he said. Mr Benn, the shadow communities secretary, said local people were best-placed to decide how rubbish was collected and should not be dictated to by government. "At a time of deep cuts, when local councils are having to make very difficult decisions, the quarter of a billion pounds Eric Pickles has found for this could be much better spent on preventing SureStart centres from closing or providing extra care for our elderly people," he added. A survey by the Press Association news agency last year found many councils were sticking with fortnightly black bin collections, claiming that a return to weekly rounds would cost millions and undermine recycling efforts. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government says 67% of people surveyed agreed the government should mandate weekly collections. Ministers say more than 70 councils have signalled interest in applying for funding. Bids which support a comprehensive weekly collection of rubbish, combined with a weekly recycling collection of materials such as glass, paper and plastics, will be prioritised. The scheme will support initiatives which reward households for recycling, with points that convert into money off at retailers, such as Windsor and Maidenhead's RecycleBank and Birmingham's Nectar programmes. And it will back mechanical biological treatment plants, already used in Bournemouth, which take all rubbish in just one bin and sort out the materials for recycling, landfill and composting. Councils have until mid-March to bid for funding, which will be available from April.	A £250m government scheme encouraging councils to keep or bring back weekly bin collections is opening for bids.
The 22-year-old has not appeared for Shrewsbury this season, but has played once for Mansfield Town and four times for Wrexham while on loan. Bolton youth product Caton has also played for Blackpool and has loan spells with Accrington and Chester before joining Shrewsbury in 2014. Caton follows Jamie McCombe, 33, in signing for the National League side. The centre-back, who played 101 games for the club during his first spell, has left Stevenage and signed a contract until the end of the 2016-17 season.	Lincoln City have signed Shrewsbury winger James Caton on loan until the end of the season.
A team statement said Henao, 28, had been contacted by cycling's governing body and an anti-doping agency about data between August 2011 and June 2015. The Colombian said he was "beyond disappointed", having missed three months in 2014 over similar concerns. "I know who I am, how hard I have worked and the sacrifices I have made to be where I am today," he added. Henao was voluntarily withdrawn by Team Sky in 2014 while they carried out research into the biological characteristics of riders who live and train at high altitude. They said the results revealed nothing to raise suspicions of wrongdoing. Team Sky stressed Henao had not failed a doping test and had been withdrawn because of the "very obvious distraction to him". "We continue to support Sergio and remain confident in the independent scientific research which was undertaken," the team added. "It is our hope that this can be looked at and resolved quickly by all the relevant authorities so Sergio can start racing again soon." A specialist climber, Henao signed with Team Sky in 2012 and finished in the top 10 in his first Grand Tour, the 2012 Giro d'Italia.	Team Sky have withdrawn Sergio Henao from riding after concerns about his biological passport data resurfaced.
The 28-year-old's contract with Korona Kielce in his homeland had expired and Grzelak has also played for Wisla Plock, Dolcan Zabki and Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biala. He becomes head coach Ian Cathro's third summer signing. "For me, it's important that this club will be my home and I'm really excited to be here," Grzelak told the Hearts website. "I've had a really good impression from everybody that I've met here so far, and I've been told that the fans are fantastic. "When I knew that I could come here, then I was very happy to come. "My good features are that I am a strong player, who likes to tackle, and I prepare myself well for the physical side of the game. But I am also very calm on the ball. "I can play in defence, both in the centre and on the left, and I can also play in the centre of midfield." Hearts, fifth in last season's top flight, have already signed defender Christophe Berra and forward Cole Stockton so far this summer. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

In a report, the agency says the past decade in Europe has been the warmest on record. It adds that the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events is rising, and the continent is set to become more vulnerable in the future. The findings have been published ahead of next week's UN climate conference. They join a UN Environment Programme report also released on Wednesday showing dangerous growth in the "emissions gap" - the difference between current carbon emission levels and those needed to avert climate change. "Every indicator we have in terms of giving us an early warning of climate change and increasing vulnerability is giving us a very strong signal," observed EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. "It is across the board, it is not just global temperatures," she told BBC News. "It is in human health aspects, in forests, sea levels, agriculture, biodiversity - the signals are coming in from right across the environment." 2C or not 2C The report - Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 - involving more than 50 authors from a range of organisations, listed a number of "key messages", including: As it currently stands, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has set a target of limiting the rise in global mean temperature to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the report's authors warn that even if this target to mitigate warming is met, "substantial impacts on society, human health and ecosystems are projected to occur". To limit the impacts, experts say effective adaptation strategies need to be developed in order to minimise the risk to nations' infrastructure, homes and businesses. The European Commission is expected to publish its European Adaptation Strategy in 2013, outlining measures it think will help the 27-nation bloc deal with future climate shifts. Examples of adaptation measures include using water resources more efficiently, adapting building codes to be able to withstand extreme weather events and building flood defences. Prof McGlade said such measures would be essential in order to climate-proof the EU. "I think what the European Commission and other parts of the world are finding is that whilst it is important to understand what is happening at the global level, it is what is happening at the regional and local levels that will really determine how economies will weather the storm," she said. The report said the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events had increased from 9bn euros (Â£7bn) in the 1980s to 13bn euros in the 2000s. One of the report's authors, Andre Jol, head of the EEA's vulnerability and adaptation group, added: "We know that the main increase in damage costs from natural disasters has not been from climate change, as such, but more as a result of an increase in wealth, people and infrastructure in risk areas. "But one of the key messages from the report is that in the future, with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, we know that climate change will contribute to the increase in the cost of damage from extreme events." 'Lack of action' On Monday, the World Bank published a report that warned that the world was "on track to a 4C [increase by the end of the century] marked by extreme heatwaves and life-threatening sea-level rise". It added that the world's poorest regions would be hardest hit by the warming, which was "likely to undermine efforts and goals". "A 4C warmer world can, and must be, avoided - we need to hold warming below 2C," said World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim. "Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today." However, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) warned that it was still possible to achieve the 2C target but time was running out. Data in the Emissions Gap Report showed that annual greenhouse gas emissions were now "14% above where they need to be in 2020". Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: "While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties." The reports have been published ahead of the annual two-week UN climate conference, which starts on Monday in Doha, Qatar.	The effects of climate change are already evident in Europe and the situation is set to get worse, the European Environment Agency has warned.
The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin. She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked. O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York. In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker". The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services. However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911." She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.	US comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has revealed that she suffered a heart attack last week.
That bargain could have backfired in a way that was neither good for his golf nor his social standing. Thankfully for the Spieth family, the lure of the clubs was too strong to resist. Eighteen years on, the obsessive kid has become a record-breaking champion. Ben Crenshaw, another Masters winner schooled in the high winds and heat of Texas, has spoken of looking into the 21-year-old's eyes and seeing the dead-eyed stare of Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp. The final day here at Augusta is often a shoot-out. The pressures of the back nine - greens like glass, fairways steep and narrow, water, water everywhere - have broken older men with far greater experience of these beautiful and brutal yards. Spieth admitted afterwards that he had struggled to sleep on Saturday night, self-effacingly pointing to his prematurely receding hairline as an indication of the stress he has been under. Yet even with so many big guns lurking - world number one Rory McIlroy, three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, major winner Justin Rose - the callow kid never looked like backing down. If it seemed less thrilling a finale than we have come to expect from Augusta, it is worth a reminder of the dramatic context: the second youngest winner in Masters history, the first to go to 19 under (before a bogey on the last), more birdies across his four rounds than any player here has ever made, the first man to win it wire to wire in 39 years. For those who have become desensitised to the scale of his achievement by the very fact that he had led so handsomely throughout, this might help: Rose and Mickelson's score of 14 under for second would have have been the winning tally in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played. Spieth has always been aimed at this day. He won the US Junior Amateur title twice (something only Tiger Woods had ever done before), tied for 16th in the Byron Nelson Championship as a 16-year-old (better than Woods ever managed as an amateur in a PGA Tour event) and became the youngest PGA Tour winner in 82 years when he won the John Deere Classic aged 19 years and 11 months. There is footage of him aged 14 declaring that his ultimate goal in life is to win the Masters. Goals like that are supposed to be good for young sportsmen. They also bring their own burden. Out on the course, beery breath and cigar smoke swirling in the cool breeze, there were groans and gasps when his overnight lead of four strokes was cut to three at only the second hole and again at the seventh. So locked in tradition is Augusta that no radios, phones or tablets are allowed through the gates, which preserves a certain atmosphere but also creates its own strange drama. How was Spieth doing? Was Mickelson closing, was Woods - full of promise of a charge through the front nine - rampaging along as of old? The only indication, for both players and patrons alike, is first when a volley of noise rolls in through the pine trees from a distant hole and then when the large wooden scoreboards are slowly adjusted by a troupe of men climbing up ladders, like stagehands dressing a particularly elaborate set. This sort of information vacuum frays the nerves of those watching, let alone a 21-year-old within touching distance of his greatest ambition. First a hole appears on the board next to the name of the player. Everyone turns and stares. Then, with minimal regard for the anxiety all around, an official will slowly insert a new numbered board. That was how Spieth found out that Mickelson was slipping, that McIlroy was improving too slowly, that Woods - name taken off the board entirely - was not the danger of old. Spieth would not give them a breath of hope. By the 10th - Rose three-putting the ninth - the lead was back to five. In the pine needles on 11, he bumped and ran beautifully to the right of the green before flicking on a wedge that stopped as if he had it on string. The crowds here were willing a Mickelson miracle. No-one is loved in these parts in the same way. Mickelson's avuncular grin, relaxed physique and famed generosity (few waitresses leave Phil's table less than $100 better off) have made him some sort of utopian Everyman for the American golf fan. Spieth's display rendered it instead first a procession and then a coronation. As he slipped on his first Green Jacket, with all the awkwardness that this sometimes painfully corny ceremony can offer, thoughts wandered off already to where he might go next. These debut grand triumphs are a lovely stage for a young sportsman, a point in time where everything seems possible, the future unchecked by the vagaries of injury, form or motivation. Spieth is still young enough to do exactly what his mother tells him - which is a good thing, when she spots you rather lost for words on the 18th green and tells you to congratulate your playing partner and thank the whooping crowd. It is a potent reminder of Woods at the same age, winning his debut Masters by exactly the same score and in the same nerveless fashion. It would take Woods almost two and-a-half years to win his next major. He would reach world number one rather sooner, within two months of his breakthrough at Augusta, and with Spieth already up to second in the rankings that particular piece of history may well repeat. It was easy to pick out what made the young Woods stand out - his huge driving, a power game that would cause even this living museum of golf to be radically altered. Even Spieth has trouble describing the best part of his own game, settling on the rather more prosaic "playing badly well" - what others would call course management and precocious self-control. Crenshaw, poetic in his Masters farewell, spoke of a "jeweller's touch". That does rather better in illustrating how beautifully precise Spieth was in adorning these greens with his short game. The only man who has putted like this at Augusta is Woods. Different characters in different eras, but in their graduation to the wider world with so much to share.	It began early for Jordan Spieth: when he was three years old and ready for potty-training, his mother Chris decided to bribe him out of nappies by hiding his plastic golf clubs on top of the washing machine until he had done what he had to do.
The US and UK have announced new carry-on restrictions banning laptops on certain passenger flights. The so-called Islamic State group (IS) has been working on ways to smuggle explosives on to planes by hiding them in electronics, US sources tell ABC. The tip-off was judged by the US to be "substantiated" and "credible". Inbound flights on nine airlines operating out of 10 airports in eight countries are subject to the US Department of Homeland Security ban. Phones and medical devices are not affected. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is hosting a two-day meeting of ministers and senior officials from 68 nations to discuss the threat from IS. The Washington talks will be the first full meeting of the coalition since December 2014. The BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher looks ahead to the Washington meeting: This will be a chance for the Trump administration to put its stamp on the global battle against the Islamic State group, and for the reticent secretary of state to put his stamp on a foreign policy issue that the president has identified as a priority. The State Department says the meeting aims to accelerate efforts to defeat IS in its remaining strongholds: the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa. On the campaign trail Mr Trump claimed to have a secret plan to obliterate the group. But his Pentagon has largely stuck with Barack Obama's strategy of supporting local ground forces, albeit with increased US military participation as the assault on Raqqa nears. Coalition members will also discuss how to stabilise and govern the cities after the conflict; and they're looking to see if Washington remains committed to a longer term effort to secure the region. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News there was "a new aviation threat". "We know that our adversaries, terrorist groups in the United States and outside the United States, seek to bring down a US-bound airliner. That's one of their highest value targets. And we're doing everything we can right now to prevent that from happening." Another member of that committee, Republican Peter King, told the New York Times he was forewarned about the ban. "It was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent. Intelligence of something possibly planned." The restriction is based, we are told, on "evaluated intelligence", BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner writes. That means that US intelligence has either intercepted discussion of a possible extremist plot or has been passed word of one by a human informant. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The nine airlines covered by the US ban are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. The British ban, announced hours after the American measure, is similar but applies to different airlines, including British Airways and EasyJet. It covers direct passenger flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. The 10 airports affected by the US ban are: The airlines included in the US decision have been given a deadline of 07:00 GMT on Saturday to impose the ban, officials said, adding that the restriction had no end date. However, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters news agency the airline understood that the US directive would come into effect on 25 March and remain valid until 14 October 2017.

Amina Al-Jeffery, 21, who was born and brought up in Swansea, was taken to Jeddah in 2012 by her father, Mohammed, who said he did it to "save her life". Mr Al-Jeffery has denied the allegations at the High Court. But Mr Justice Holman said she had been "deprived of her liberty" and her father must facilitate her return. Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, says her father took the action against her will after she "kissed a guy". Delivering the court order, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery "must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare" by 11 September. However, he accepted there was "little or nothing this court could do" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery "was determined not to comply with it". But he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied. Mr Justice Holman added: "There are no conventions between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The courts in Saudi Arabia would not even recognise the basis of the claim, because it does not recognise dual nationality." Her lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015. She said she had been "physically abused" and there were times when she had not been allowed to leave her room, meaning she had to use it as a toilet. She described having her head smacked against the wall. Ms Hutchinson later told BBC Newsnight it had been a "difficult" but "compelling" case to work on. "I'm absolutely delighted that the judge has said he has got jurisdiction and that he has gone on to exercise his jurisdiction and make orders. "I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order," she said. Mr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales. He said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities. He said he wanted to make sure Ms Al-Jeffery was safe and was not being mistreated. Neither Amina nor her father were in court to hear the ruling. And the question now is what difference a ruling in the High Court of England and Wales will make in Saudi Arabia. Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that there is "little or nothing" this court could do to enforce the order if Amina's father was determined not to obey or comply with it. Certainly the basis on which it was granted, that Amina has dual British and Saudi nationality, is not recognised in Saudi Arabia. And it is perhaps telling that Mohammed Al-Jeffery's legal costs have been paid for by the Saudi embassy. However, the judge stated that to do nothing "would in my view amount to a dereliction towards Amina". The court was told that in April Mr Al-Jeffery instigated legal proceedings against his daughter in Jeddah "seeking parental control over his child for the purposes of caring and supervision". Legal documentation showed both father and daughter agreed to a reconciliation. But Mr Justice Holman said that meant if "she were to run away the police, far from offering her protection from her father, would put her in prison". Mr Justice Holman said: "If Amina chooses to remain voluntarily in Saudi Arabia she must of course adhere to the law and culture of that society but the current constraint is denying to her the ability to be British and to live in Britain. "It is true that she is currently present and habitually resident in Saudi Arabia, but that is due to her obedience to her father in 2012. She did not travel there of her own free will." He said Mr Al-Jeffery "voluntarily chose to live for many years in Wales, to educate and bring his children up here... and to accept the constraints of the legal system of England and Wales". The judge said the fact Ms Al-Jeffery was born and brought up in Britain until she was almost 17 was a "very significant factor" in his decision. The court was told Mr Al-Jeffery's wife, from whom he is not estranged, and several of his children continue to live in the UK. Swansea West MP Geraint Davies has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to demand immediate action over the case. The former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "We recognise that this is a distressing time for Ms Al-Jeffery. We have been providing assistance to her since the case was first brought to our attention and will continue to do so. "British embassy staff have met with her to check on her welfare and helped her speak to lawyers in the UK."	A woman who claims her father has kept her locked up against her will in Saudi Arabia must be allowed to return to Britain, a UK judge has ruled.
The 32-year-old knows Coleman's side will be tough to beat having improved hugely since two defeats by Serbia in the last World Cup qualifying campaign. The Chelsea defender, who has led Serbia to the top of Group D, says they face a difficult match ahead of them. "This is the hardest game since we started qualification," he said. Ivanovic scored in the 6-1 thrashing of Wales in 2014 World Cup qualifying at Novi Sad, in September 2012 - the heaviest defeat in Coleman's reign. A year later he was part of the side which won 3-0 at the Cardiff City Stadium - the last time Wales lost a home qualifier. Set to earn his 91st cap for his country on Saturday, Ivanovic believes the scars of the past will provide extra motivation for Wales. "We know that and we have to be careful with that. We have to play much much better than last time to get something from the game because Wales is a completely different team from that moment," he continued. "Those kind of games happen may be once in 100 years. It's very difficult to win against one team three times in a row even when the opponent is not that strong and you cannot say that about Wales." Serbia go into the game topping the group as they edge the Republic of Ireland on goal difference while Wales are two points adrift in third. The visitors will be without the suspended Manchester City defender Aleksander Kolarov, who is suspended after collecting two bookings in the group. Wales will welcome the return of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey for the first time in this campaign after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Ivanovic believes they will be stronger for his inclusion, but inevitably the major threat will be Real Madrid star Gareth Bale. "I think he is the biggest name and biggest star in the Wales team. But I think Wales as a group have improved," Ivanovic said. "The team have played a couple of years together to bring results and will, of course, be very difficult to stop Gareth Bale and the rest of the guys." "Most important for us is we have a lot of new things - new coach, new shape of the team. We are still building. We have improved a lot from last summer and we are going in the right direction. "But the way to Russia is so long we have to be careful and we have to play every single game like a final.  We know this is our hardest game so far."	Branislav Ivanovic says Wales will want to avenge their previous two defeats against Serbia when they meet in Saturday's World Cup qualifier.
Mr Tucker will take over on 1 October, succeeding Douglas Flint who has been in the role since 2010. The appointment breaks an HSBC tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, who plans to step down next year. While HSBC is Europe's biggest bank, the bulk of its profits are generated in Asia. Mr Tucker has been chief executive of AIA for seven years, during which he oversaw the insurer's expansion in Asia. Before AIA, he was the chief executive of insurance giant Prudential, and brings to HSBC his experience at the top of a UK financial giant as well as his Asian exposure. Richard Dunbar of Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC the bank has "obviously decided" that an external perspective would be useful to HSBC at this time. He added that while chief executive of Prudential, Mr Tucker did a good job of expanding its Asian assets, which are seen as the firm's "jewel in the crown". HSBC has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years it has cut more than 40,000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60% last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For HSBC, that problem has been compounded by its move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007. Those challenges make the appointment of a new chief executive even more crucial for investors, a search which will now be led by Mr Tucker. HSBC has also been attempting to repair its image after a series of scandals. Earlier this year it reached a $470m (Â£325m) settlement with the US government and states related to dubious mortgage lending and foreclosure practices during the financial crisis. In 2015 Mr Gulliver and Mr Flint apologised for "unacceptable" practices at its Swiss private bank which helped clients to avoid tax. In late 2012 HSBC paid US authorities $1.9bn in a settlement over money laundering. AIA said that Ng Keng Hooi, would take over as chief executive from 1 September.	HSBC has appointed Mark Tucker, the chief executive of Asian insurer AIA, as group chairman.
The ex-Villa player and Nottingham Forest boss, 51, quit his role as Chris Hughton's number two prior to Friday's 1-1 draw between the two sides. "When I heard Colin was interested he shot to the top of the pile," Villa boss Steve Bruce told the club website. "We interviewed two or three people but once I knew Colin was available there was only one person I wanted here." The move to the West Midlands gives Calderwood, who also previously managed Hibernian and Northampton Town, a shorter daily commuting distance from his Northampton home. Media playback is not supported on this device A Brighton statement released on Friday said Calderwood, who was placed on gardening leave on 12 November, had left the club for a job "elsewhere". "We have to move on," added Hughton. "We have a team that is very well drilled at this moment. My main concern is that we have no disruption here. I will think long and hard about bringing someone in that position." Bruce took over as Villa boss on 12 October, bringing in former Birmingham City player Stephen Clemence as head coach, having had him as part of his backroom team at Sunderland and Hull City. The club also named Ian Atkins as their new chief scout/head of European recruitment. Villa director of football Steve Round added: "We are delighted to secure the services of Colin. He is an excellent coach and an outstanding person. "He has a wealth of experience at the highest level and will be a great addition to our management team."

It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: "Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. "The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. "Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business." The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not "lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating "perverse incentives". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a "Fair Pay Charter" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.	Britain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.
They seized the regional government's headquarters and prosecutor's office before opening fire with automatic weapons at the main police station. Interim President Olexander Turchynov criticised local police for their "inaction" and "criminal treachery". The US accused Russia of seeking to "change the security landscape" of Eastern and Central Europe. By David SternBBC News, Kiev The pro-Russian gunmen in Ukraine's east seem to be following a strategy of constant expansion and pressure on the Kiev government. Hardly a day goes by without another incident. Just recently, official buildings in Kostyantynivka have been taken over, Western military monitors detained, peaceful demonstrators in Donetsk attacked, and now the regional administration building in Luhansk has been seized. It is difficult to say what their ultimate goal is. Perhaps it is to keep government officials in Kiev on the defensive, forcing them to put out a number of fires at once, while others pop up throughout the region. Or else it is simply to keep the situation unstable, in order to prevent the presidential election scheduled to take place on 25 May. Or it could be just the opposite, as many in Kiev and throughout the country fear: to provoke the Ukrainians into a full crackdown, which would in turn spark a Russian invasion. The militants have called on Moscow to intervene on more than one occasion. In a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Kremlin to "leave Ukraine in peace" and warned: "Nato territory is inviolable we will defend every single inch of it." In other developments on Tuesday: Moscow has said it has no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia activists have seized government buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities. Until now, only the local office of the State Security Service (SBU) in Luhansk, a city of 465,000 people less than 30km (20 miles) from the Russian border, had been targeted. But on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people shouting "Russia, Russia" gathered outside the headquarters of the regional government to demand a referendum on greater autonomy. A group of men armed with sticks and metal bars broke into the building. They pulled down the Ukrainian flag flying from the roof and replaced it with a Russian tricolour and the flag of Donetsk People's Republic. Crowds of pro-Russia activists then overran the building housing the prosecutor's office before attacking the headquarters of the interior ministry's police force. Hours later, an AFP news agency journalist reported that officers had abandoned the police station and been taken away in buses, as an angry crowd shouted at them to "Go home". Activists also went into a regional television station, but decided not to take it over after they were allowed to make a live broadcast. Following the takeovers, President Turchynov demanded the dismissal of the police chiefs in Luhansk and the other eastern city of Donetsk. "The overwhelming majority of law enforcement bodies in the east are incapable of fulfilling their duty to defend our citizens," he said. Pro-Russia activists control much of the neighbouring Donetsk region. Sanctions By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow Sanctions screw is tightened Eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population, was a stronghold for former President Yanukovych before he was overthrown by protesters in February. The interim government has rejected the pro-Russian activists' demands for greater autonomy, fearing they could lead to the break-up of the country or more regions being annexed by Russia, as happened with Crimea last month. Pro-Russian activists continue to detain some 40 people, including seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) seized last week. On Tuesday evening, the self-styled "mayor" of the town of Sloviansk, where the observers are being held, said "good progress" had been made at talks with OSCE representatives. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov had earlier warned that they would only be released if the EU dropped its sanctions against separatist leaders. Earlier, the EU published a fresh list of 15 individuals facing travel bans and asset freezes. It included the chief of the Russian General Staff, the head of Russian military intelligence, and a Russian deputy prime minister, as well as separatist leaders in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk. On Monday, the US announced sanctions against seven individuals and 17 companies it said were linked to President Putin's "inner circle". President Putin warned that new sanctions might have an impact on the operations of Western companies in Russia. "If this continues, we will of course have to think about how they work in the Russian Federation, including in key sectors of the Russian economy such as energy," he said, adding that there were "neither Russian instructors, nor special units, nor troops" in Ukraine. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions, first imposed by Washington and Brussels after Crimea was annexed, had so far caused "a quite substantial deterioration in Russia's already weak economy".	Pro-Russia activists have stormed several official buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk.
It does not include a final decision about where to locate a new station in or near Sheffield. The announcement confirms ministers' commitment to push ahead with the controversial £56bn project, which they say will boost the economy. Critics say HS2 is not needed and will spoil parts of the countryside. The announcement removes much of the uncertainty over the project, except over where to site Sheffield's station - a decision on which is expected next year. The government's preferred option is for the main HS2 route to run east of Sheffield, with a separate spur to take passengers to Sheffield city centre. This would cost around £1bn less than the alternative suggestions - which involved taking the main HS2 line through Sheffield city centre or to a new station at the Meadowhall shopping centre just outside Sheffield, near the M1. Another spur will take HS2 to a new station at Manchester airport. The first phase of the £56bn railway is due to open in December 2026, with trains to travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before continuing on the existing West Coast Main Line. The second, Y-shaped phase is due to be completed by about 2032-33. Now that the government has confirmed most of its chosen route, it will go through the parliamentary process. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said support and compensation would be available to those affected by the project, who can begin the process now by contacting HS2 Ltd. The Department for Transport says compensation will be calculated at 110% of the value their home would have had without any plans for HS2. Anyone living within 60m of the route is entitled to compensation, although the DfT said that could be extended in certain circumstances and wasn't "a hard and fast rule". Nevertheless, communities along the proposed route in South Yorkshire are still voicing strong objections. Among them are residents of the newly built Shimmer Estate in Mexborough, which is likely to be demolished to make way for the new rail line. Resident Russell Holmes said: "It may be a new estate, but it's a proper community. For that to be destroyed is devastating. "But the uncertainty, waiting until it happens, when you can actually put something in place to move, is horrible as well." The area's MP, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, said he would oppose the planned Sheffield part of the route, saying it "flies in the face of evidence, logic, value for money and the needs and interests of local people". He added: "This is the wrong decision for South Yorkshire, wrong for Doncaster and wrong for the residents who will see their homes destroyed and communities blighted." Jonathan Pile, of campaign group Yorkshire Against HS2, said the proposed route was "unsuitable, should be struck out" and was "unfit for purpose". Pressure group Stop HS2 said that once the high-speed railway was operating, existing intercity services to London would be reduced by up to two trains an hour. The group's campaign manager, Joe Rukin, said ministers were "trying to con the public" that the high-speed line was needed to boost rail capacity. "The government have finally come clean in admitting 'freeing up capacity' means for many cities 'losing the trains you already have', as the HS2 business case demands £8.3bn worth of cuts to existing services," he added.	The government has announced the route for the second phase of the high-speed rail line HS2, from Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) accused ministers of offering an "unworkable" guarantee to protect firefighters aged over 55 who fail fitness tests "through no fault of their own". The government said it had been "clear" that the staff would get full pensions. It said "robust" plans were in place to protect the public during the strike. In December, MPs approved plans to make firefighters in England work until they are 60 and to increase their pension contributions. Fire minister Penny Mordaunt said no firefighter over 55 would lose their job for losing fitness if it was not their fault. But the FBU says it has contacted fire authorities and "a number" said they would not uphold the guarantee. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack claimed: "It is clear that when Penny Mordaunt gave the guarantee in Parliament she would have been aware that no fire authority ever planned to implement the 'guarantee'." He said Ms Mordaunt had "misled" fire service staff and Parliament, and firefighters were "unbelievably angry with the disgraceful actions of this government". A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said firefighters who "fail a fitness test through no fault of their own and cannot regain fitness with remedial help" would get an "unreduced pension". The FBU said its members in Northern Ireland had ended their dispute following a "revised and improved offer with a lower pension age". It said members in Scotland and Wales would not strike because "genuine negotiations" had taken place.	Firefighters in England say their next one-day strike in the long-running dispute with the government over pensions will be on 25 February.
Linda Norgrove, from Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, had been working in the country when she was kidnapped. Former colleagues have told a BBC Alba documentary that her captors told Ms Norgrove she was only being held hostage as a bargaining tool. The 36-year-old was killed by a US grenade during a failed rescue attempt. Ms Norgrove had been working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan in 2010 when she was seized by rebels. Colleagues still working in the country told BBC Alba that her captors told Ms Norgrove they did not intend to kill her. She was led to believe she was being held captive to secure the release of rebel prisoners and would be set free when that happened. The programme also shows images of Ms Norgrove's kidnappers that she took herself on her camera and phone before she was killed. It had first been thought her captors killed her during the US rescue mission in October 2010 but later evidence confirmed she was killed by a grenade thrown by a US special forces soldier. Ms Norgrove was abducted along with at least one other colleague who survived the rescue attempt. Abdul Wadood, another former colleague who is still working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, said: "Linda asked the abductors when they were planning to kill her and then the abductors talked to her in a very soft language and they told her and assured her that she would not be killed, because that was not their purpose to kill her - all they wanted was to release some of their prisoners, in the end she would be released when this deed is done." Travelling to Afghanistan, Ms Norgrove's parents John and Lorna said it was important for them to see where their daughter had lived and worked and to review the aid work now supported by the charity they set up in her name. Mr Norgrove said: "We deliberately took a choice that we thought what we should try and do is try and make something positive, because I think that's what Linda would have wanted after Linda had been killed. "It was with that in mind that we started up the charity that we did and it stopped us getting totally involved in all this blame culture of trying to work out whose fault it was, because at the end of the day I don't think it was anybody's fault." The Linda Norgrove Foundation is now providing financial help for the kind of work Ms Norgrove did while she was in Afghanistan, including support for schools and hospitals. Lorgan Linda - Linda's Story will be on BBC Alba on Monday 8 October at 21.00 and later on the iPlayer	The aid worker who died in Afghanistan during an attempt to free her two years ago was told by her captors they were not going to kill her, it has emerged.

The government said 19 of the 24 bills outlined in the speech will apply in whole or in part to Scotland. And the Scottish secretary said there will "undoubtedly" be more powers devolved to Edinburgh after Brexit. But opposition parties said the general election result meant the Conservatives have no mandate to govern. The SNP claimed that Theresa May was a "lame duck prime minister leading a lame duck government". And Scottish Labour said the speech had set out a "weak, vague and mean-spirited programme from a government in meltdown". Ms May - who lost her majority in the snap election earlier this month - has been forced to either axe or delay a number of key manifesto plans. Much of what remained in the Queen's Speech related to Brexit, including the so-called Repeal Bill - which will copy all existing EU laws into UK law, with parliament then deciding which bits to retain. The bill would give the UK Parliament temporary authority to amend laws that do not "operate appropriately" after Brexit. And existing decision-making powers devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be maintained pending further discussion on "lasting common frameworks". Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the powers will be returned from Brussels "in a way that works best for Scotland and the rest of the UK". He added: "There will undoubtedly be more decision-making powers coming to Holyrood, and I look forward to working closely with the Scottish government on this." The Scottish government has repeatedly claimed that the prime minister is planning a "power grab" because she has not confirmed that all of the powers associated with devolved areas, such as fishing and agriculture, will be handed to Holyrood once they return from Brussels. Ahead of what was a relatively low-key State Opening of Parliament, the prime minister promised to work with "humility and resolve" after failing to win the general election outright. In an apparent sign of recognition that she must seek a broad consensus for any Brexit deal, Mrs May said getting EU withdrawal right will mean securing "a deal which delivers the result of last year's referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support". The government used the Queen's Speech to stress that one of its priorities was to "build a more united country, strengthening the social, economic and cultural bonds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales". And Mrs May said her programme for government would include measures to support the aerospace industry in Wales, protect access to British waters that are "so important to Scottish fishermen", and open new markets for key exporting industries in Northern Ireland. She said: "So this is a government with purpose. Determined to deliver the best Brexit deal, committed to keeping our country safe, enhancing our standing in the wider world and bringing our United Kingdom closer together." The Queen had earlier been accompanied by the Prince of Wales, rather than the Duke of Edinburgh, for the ceremony. Prince Philip was admitted to hospital on Tuesday night as a "precautionary measure" for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. Conservative ministers are still attempting to secure a deal with the DUP, which would see the Northern Irish party support Mrs May's minority government. As well as the bill to convert EU rules into UK law, the government unveiled measures on trade, customs, immigration, fisheries, agriculture, nuclear and sanctions. On immigration, a bill will legislate for the end of free movement from the EU and make the status of EU nationals and family members subject to UK law. Although there are no specific details about a new system, ministers say they will be able to "control" numbers while attracting the "brightest and the best". A Fisheries bill will allow the UK to take on responsibility for "access to fisheries and management of its waters". And an Agriculture Bill will "provide stability" for farmers and ensure an "effective system" of support to replace the Common Agricultural Policy. Ian Blackford, the SNP's new leader at Westminster, said there was "nothing in the programme to try and turn around the faltering economy, or how to support our under-pressure public services". He added: "No one can have any confidence in this Tory government's ability to speak on Scotland's behalf in the vital Brexit negotiations - this makes it all the more vital that Scotland is given a seat at the negotiating table." Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said the government's proposals failed to reflect the message that voters sent to Mrs May in the general election. She said: "Theresa May has no political authority, and while she struggles to stitch together a deal with the DUP to stay in office, she has been forced to ditch policies from her wildly unpopular manifesto." The Liberal Democrats said the Queen's Speech was "bereft" of ideas to support public services.	The prime minister has pledged to bring the United Kingdom "closer together" as her government unveiled its proposed new laws in the Queen's Speech.
The 33-year-old was injured at Colchester police station in Essex during a struggle when he grabbed hold of a toilet bowl in his cell. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has started an investigation into the incident. It is believed seven Essex Police officers will be questioned.  The force has not commented. It is thought the IPCC will investigate claims the man was handcuffed after his fingers were severed, and allegations of a significant time delay in taking him to hospital. The prisoner, who lost part of three fingers on his left hand, was taken to hospital following the incident on 1 May. He had been taken into custody in connection with a public order incident. A spokesman for the IPCC said: "The Independent Police Complaints Commission is to independently investigate an incident at Colchester Police Station on May 1, 2015 where a man suffered serious hand injuries while in custody. "Further information is likely to be published in due course."	A police force is being investigated after a prisoner had three fingers severed while in custody.
The East Antrim MP had been considering putting his name forward after Nigel Dodds ruled himself out. Finance Minister Arlene Foster is the only person so far to declare an interest and has the backing of a majority of the party's most senior elected representatives. Nominations to become the next leader of the DUP close later on Wednesday. Peter Robinson announced in November that he was standing down as party leader. On Tuesday, Mrs Foster said she was "very humbled" by the support she has received from party colleagues. Mr Wilson thought long and hard about his decision and spoke to among others, party colleagues Mrs Foster and Mr Dodds. In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the party's wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. "We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future," she said. In a tweet on Monday night, Mr Robinson said he had "received a valid nomination" from Mrs Foster for the post of DUP leader. "Arlene's nomination was submitted with the support of over 75% of those entitled to vote in the electoral college," he added.	Sammy Wilson has said he will not be running for the DUP leadership.
The video of Bailey Matthews showing him abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line has been viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times. Bailey, from Doncaster, was given the Richard Whiteley award at a ceremony in Leeds on Friday night. Cricketer Joe Root received the Sporting Achievement award. The Yorkshire Awards, now in their 27th year, "recognise the many and varied achievements of people and businesses in the county". Bailey competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for four km and running for 1.3 km. Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame. Bailey's family said: "We are extremely honoured to receive the Richard Whiteley award for Bailey's efforts and it makes it all the more special with being proud northerners." Sheffield-born Root became the leading batsman in the ICC world rankings after helping England beat Australia to regain the Ashes. The 24-year-old has established himself as one of England's key performers and is closing on 3,000 test runs. Root said the award was a "real honour" and he wanted to thank everyone who had supported him. TV chef Rosemary Shrager, who has worked and lived in Yorkshire for many years, was presented with the Woman of the Year award, while Rotherham-born William Hague was named Man of the Year. Mr Hague, former MP for Richmond, said: "Whatever I have done, and wherever I have been in the world, I have never stopped being a Yorkshireman, and never will." Sir David Wootton picked up the Lifetime Achievement while Huddersfield-born poet Simon Armitage won the Arts and Entertainment award. Mr Armitage's numerous accolades include a BAFTA winning film Feltham Sings for which he received an Ivor Novello award. The Business Enterprise award was given to timber company Howarth Timber. Starting in Leeds in 1840, it has expanded from a one-man business to an employer of more than 1,000 people. North Yorkshire famer Gareth Barlow was presented with the Countryside award while junior football coach Stephen Shipley won the Community Hero award.	An eight-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who was filmed completing his first triathlon unaided has been honoured at the Yorkshire Awards.
Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, who were "holding hands" as they crossed the road, died after the crash on Ashton Road. Four men, aged 59, 48, 38 and 18, remain in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A fifth man, aged 23, has been de-arrested, police said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was initially arrested for the same offence but was now assisting police with enquiries. Greater Manchester Police said it had identified the car involved in the collision as a Blue Peugeot 807. The dark blue vehicle, which had evidence of previous damage to its rear window, was found abandoned on Honeywell Lane. Nigel Whittle, principal of Oasis Academy, Oldham, said the school was "deeply saddened" by the news of the deaths of Zaneta, who was a first year student, and her cousin Helina Kotlarova, a former pupil. He said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this extremely distressing and difficult time. "We are a very closely-knit school community.  As our students return following the Christmas break, I know that they will care for one another, and our staff will be available to offer the support and time necessary as we all come to terms with this awful loss." He said with the agreement of the Krokova family the school would join together to pay tribute to Zaneta in the coming weeks. A book of condolence would be opened on Thursday, he said.	Police have been given more time to question four men held over an apparent hit-and-run crash in Oldham on New Year's Eve in which two cousins died.
The cameras will be operated by the Canadian Urthecast company, which intends to stream high-resolution video of the planet to web users. Russian cosmonauts completed the attachment in a six-hour spacewalk on Monday. It followed an aborted installation attempt in December. On that occasion, there was a difficulty in getting telemetry through to Moscow mission control. In a statement on Tuesday, Urthecast confirmed that both cameras were passing data to the ground following the latest effort. "During the installation, we were able to complete all of the intended tests during the spacewalk," the statement read. "At this time, all telemetry received and analysed is within our expected results." The cameras were made for Urthecast by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, UK. The high-resolution video unit should provide a resolution on the ground of about 1m per pixel. Large crowds and moving vehicles would be visible on this scale. The second camera will provide static imagery at a medium resolution of 5m per pixel. "Testing of every part of the camera system will now follow. Once that's completed, we can expect the first imagery to be released publicly," said Prof Richard Holdaway, the director of RAL Space. "We'll be helping Urthecast. We'll be checking the optical alignment and focus, to see that it is everything we expected," he told BBC News. Urthecast hopes to build a business around space station imagery. One of the customer sectors for the hi-res video, for example, is likely to be news organisations that want moving pictures of major events, such as war zones and regions of the Earth hit by natural disasters. It is hoping also to generate social media buzz around its imagery products, by enabling people to tag and share pictures through a special web portal. Urthecast is one of a group of Earth observation start-ups currently in the process of launching and commissioning space hardware. Skybox Imaging of San Francisco has already started to showcase video of Earth acquired by its small, free-flying SkySat-1 satellite.  And Planet Labs, another San Francisco venture, has a "flock" of 28 nano-satellite imagers that are about to be released out of the airlock on the ISS. The station itself is increasingly becoming a platform for Earth observation. This is quite a challenge, however. The movement of the astronauts inside the ISS makes it flex, and there is a constant vibration from onboard equipment. All this requires cameras to have dampers built into their rigs to maintain a steady shot. The US space agency (Nasa) will be launching another two Earth-observing instruments to the station this year.  One will study ocean winds and storms; the other will examine small particles in the atmosphere that can influence the climate.	Two British-built Earth-observation cameras have been successfully installed on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS)
Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, had been missing since the collapse in February. His body was found on Wednesday and workers who carried out the search formed a guard of honour as it was driven from the site in the early hours of the morning. Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, remain missing. The body of a fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was previously recovered from the site. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris, who has been involved with the family since the incident, said they still did not know all the facts about the collapse. She said: "I feel very sad. My heart and my prayers go out to the family who have waited desperately for Christopher's body to be found. They can finally have closure, and say goodbye to him and grieve his loss. "But let's not forget that there's two other families who are still waiting for their loved ones to be returned." The building was due for demolition when it partially collapsed in February.	A body found in the ruins of a collapsed building at Didcot Power Station has been identified.
An effort to raise cash for a role-playing video game was exposed as a fraud by users of Reddit, Something Awful and other sites. The project             had $4,739 (Â£2,922) in pledges  out of a target of $80,000 at the point it was pulled by its creator. Kickstarter could not provide comment at this time. The site has successfully funded             nearly 22,000 schemes  since it was created in 2009. Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men had promised "gameplay characteristics will be similar to that of World of Warcraft and the graphics quality should be up there with Skyrim". The commitment to compete on an equal footing with big budget titles and a claim that "animations will be done via motion capture thanks to some friends at Disney/Pixar" raised suspicions. The scheme also offered supporters the chance of being motion captured so that they could appear as a "god" in the game, a life-sized sword and a copy of the soundtrack recorded "at the Disney Studios" if they gave enough money. Internet users subsequently reported that teaser screenshots had been copied from unrelated concept art and graphic design tutorial websites. No money transferred hands as Kickstarter only charges backers' credit cards if a project attracts enough support before a time limit expires. However, some users have raised concerns about whether the site was doing enough to vet applicants. "What worried me the most is how Kickstarter allowed this to be posted in the first place," wrote David Kononen on the site's comments page. "A simple Google search, and I found out for myself this was very shady." The person responsible for the scam may have been trying to capitalise on the success of another video game. The studio Double Fine recently raised over $3.3m from more than 87,000 backers to develop a new point-and-click adventure. That sum has since been eclipsed by Pebble, an effort to build an e-paper based watch which has raised close to $7.7m in pledges, smashing its $100,000 goal with more than a fortnight to go before its deadline.	Crowdsourced funding site Kickstarter has suffered its first publicised scam.
Twenty-four buildings at Stow Maries Aerodrome, near Maldon, have been Grade II star-listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The airfield site, which was used as a base for the 37th Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, is one of the few remaining of its kind in the country. It was listed for its "rarity" and "historical importance", Heritage Minister John Penrose said. The aerodrome was created in 1914 by the forerunner to the Royal Air Force. It was one of several in the south east of England used to defend London from German Zeppelin airship and bomber raids during the conflict. It ceased being used by the military in 1919 and was returned to agricultural use. Its buildings remained and, according to English Heritage, is now "the largest known surviving group of Royal Flying Corps buildings on a WWI aerodrome". In recent years the aerodrome was bought by private owners, who have had the buildings restored, and created a museum to tell its role during the war. In 2010, a war memorial commemorating the 10 pilots of 37 Squadron killed in action during WWI was erected on the former parade ground. Among the 24 surviving buildings are the officers' mess, accommodation huts, ammunition store, workshops, blacksmiths and mortuary. On granting the listed status, Mr Penrose said the aerodrome was a "poignant reminder of the conditions in which they were working". "I am listing Stow Maries for its rarity, its architectural interest, its value as a group and also of course for its historical importance as the first line of defence against German air raids," he said. English Heritage chief executive Simon Thurley said: "The importance of Stow Maries is amplified by the approaching 100th anniversary of the Great War. "It's in a remarkable state of preservation, full of historic interest and of great educational potential."	A World War I airbase in Essex has been granted listed status.
Lancashire batsman Livingstone, who scored 129 from 83 balls for England Lions against South Africa A last week, is one of five uncapped players named. Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Tom Curran and Craig Overton are the other four players yet to make their debut. The three-match series starts in Southampton on 21 June. England lost their last Twenty20 series 2-1 to India in February. Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June. This will allow them to gain experience of playing with the pink Dukes balls that will be used for the first day-night Test to be played in England, against West Indies at Edgbaston in August. Sussex fast bowler Tymal Mills, meanwhile, has been ruled out with a back injury, but Durham seamer Mark Wood returns after missing the India series through injury. Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March. Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire. Jason Roy, who has managed just 18 runs in three innings for England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, is named in the squad. Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: "The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition. "With five uncapped players selected, there is undoubted talent coming through the system and we are excited to see some of these players showcase their skills at the highest level." BBC Radio Lancashire's Scott Read There is a touch of Kevin Pietersen about Liam Livingstone when he gets onto the front foot to pull through mid-wicket. He is a powerful, destructive batsman who in white-ball cricket has the ability to take games away from the opposition and is great fun to watch.	Liam Livingstone has been given his first senior international call-up as England rest five players for the Twenty20 series against South Africa.
Silcox Coaches is a private coach hire and tour operator with bases in Pembroke Dock and Tenby, and has a contract with Pembrokeshire council to provide school transport. Letters have been sent home to staff this week explaining the situation and that a buyer is being sought. Silcox has been asked for a comment. It is understood customers enquiring about trips they have booked have been told the company has taken this action in order to protect the business as it seeks a new owner. The company was founded in 1882 and has run bus services around Pembrokeshire since 1932.  It is also one of the main suppliers for local sport teams. Pembrokeshire council said it was waiting to hear how a potential sale of Silcox would affect school transport. A council spokesman said: "We are aware of the possible restructuring of the company and we will work with all interested parties. "We anticipate a clearer picture of the situation emerging next week." He added: "At this time, Silcox continues to operate and the council will continue to pay the company for the work it is carrying out in accordance with our contractual obligations."	About 100 jobs could be at risk at a Pembrokeshire coach company which intends to file for administration, BBC Wales understands.
The company's management team says the internet means that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has fallen dramatically from its peak in the mid-1970s. We have been asking what you think of this change; on Twitter, on Facebook and on our story. Many of you think it is a most welcome move and might even help encourage a more respectful portrayal of women in the media. Others think it is simply a smart marketing choice. Some, rather wistfully, see it as the "end of an era". Other people say that without the nudity, it is the beginning of the end of Playboy. However, many others are pointing out that if you want to see naked people, you can just go online. As Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders put it: "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free." Quite. Maybe there is a bigger problem. Is the magazine itself outdated as a form of media? Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000. Finally, some people are simply very happy that a certain well-known trope will now be true.	Playboy magazine has announced it is to stop publishing pictures of fully naked women.
Kirsty McGuire, from Dover, Kent, said her son Codie McDowell was left screaming with pain. The accident in East Sussex has led his family to warn of the dangers of barbecues on beaches to prevent it happening to anyone else. But Rother council said disposal barbecues were banned from the beach. Ms McGuire said: "He stood on it, yelped 'just get it off me, get it off me'  and that's when my brother's picked him up and all the bottom of his foot's just blistered." She said when they looked at the sand they first realised it was bright red and then they saw the barbecue underneath it. "How someone could just be so selfish and not put their rubbish in the bin," she said. "It doesn't take long to put a barbecue out especially with the amount of sea that's there and dispose of it properly." She added: "I felt helpless. He was in so much pain and screaming and there's nothing that I could have done to prevent it and when he's laying there in hospital and he's 'mummy take the pain away', obviously it breaks my heart." She said her son now needed hospital visits every three or four days for his injuries. Councillor Simon Elford, tourism portfolio holder at Rother District Council, said:  "We were very sorry to hear at the injuries received by this young boy and wish him a speedy recovery. "To ensure the safety of everyone using this popular beach, disposable barbecues are banned and our officers carry out regular checks of the beach during busy periods."	A four-year-old child has been badly burned after he stepped on a disposable barbecue that was buried at Camber Sands while it was still alight.
The main feature was a drop in bank shares. That came after the news that Deutsche Bank faces a $14bn penalty to settle an investigation by US regulators into the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Shares in RBS fell by 4.4%, Barclays by 2.8% and Standard Chartered by 2.7%. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said the Deutsche case could have serious implications for RBS which was "among a number of European institutions that could face similar claims from the US Department of Justice", he said. "RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. "Even a third of this figure could deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon," Mr Wilson added. Among the main risers in London were TUI, up nearly 4%; Shire, up 3.2%; and Burberry, up 3%. On the currency markets, the pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.309 and dropped 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1730.	(Close): London share prices fell back slightly, with the FTSE 100 index closing 20 points lower at 6,710, a fall of just 0.3%.
"The rules of the game are changing," the prime minister declared. And he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism. I can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end. Chaos ensued. Opposition parties protested they had not been consulted. The then Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee dismissed the policies as "half-baked". And Mr Blair went on holiday leaving his Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to pick up the pieces. Day after day, there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified, rewritten and embellished. Some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles, such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge. The attacks transformed the politics of the summer. But the key point is this: Mr Blair had already won his third election in May with a healthy majority of 66. In contrast, Theresa May is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on. For the prime minister, there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her Labour predecessor. Anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones. And laws do not always help. Since 2000, there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by Parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real. Yet Mrs May clearly felt the need to say something in Downing Street in response to the London Bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence, sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces. The fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that, in her mind, the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident. And, of course, a four-point plan was better than Mr Blair's 12. This was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election. Long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of Islamist terrorism. Where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on Brexit or tax or spending, much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers, intelligence capacity and extremist ideology. It is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent, allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial. It lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the Olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a Downing Street podium can confer upon them. In times of uncertainty, the status quo looks attractive. As Belloc rhymed, "Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse". Yet for Mrs May this is a double-edged sword. Her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism. Yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat. Has she, for example, been increasing or cutting police budgets? Security is also double-edged for Jeremy Corbyn. These attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force, to accuse him of consorting with members of the IRA, and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws. But the issue also allows the Labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force. It also gives him space to question some of Britain's alliances with countries in the Middle East from where some Islamist ideology originated. The truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward. In Israel, for instance, what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left. But the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy. The terror attack in Paris this April did not help the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. But in Spain in 2004, the attack on Madrid's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right Popular Party from defeat. The bottom line, perhaps, is that many voters in Britain will have seen terrorism before. And they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote. They also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term.	After the bomb attacks on London in July 2005, Tony Blair summoned the media to Downing Street for a news conference.
The 20-year-old striker was sent off by Mike Jones in Blues' 2-0 win on Saturday. But an FA Regulatory Commission upheld Blues' appeal for wrongful dismissal. Adams is now free to play against Bristol City on Sunday, with Harry Redknapp's side needing victory to secure Championship safety. Blues are 20th in the table and go to Aston Gate two points clear of the relegation zone but with an inferior goal difference to Nottingham Forest and Blackburn immediately below them.	Che Adams will be available to play in Birmingham City's final game of the season after his red card against Huddersfield was rescinded.
Gwent Police was called to the incident near Raglan Services at about 11:30 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service said a patient had been taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. The road was closed in both directions between Monmouth and Raglan for about four hours but police said traffic was now moving freely.	A person has been taken to hospital by air ambulance following a serious crash on a major road in Monmouthshire.
In Theresa May's letter triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty she states: "We believe its necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.' But Donald Tusk responded today: "Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time as suggested by some in the UK will not happen." Bluntly, the divorce bill would have to settled before talks on trade can begin. What's more, only one party to the break-up, the European Council, would decide if the settlement is good enough. This rebuff was always likely, and the Downing Street response restrained - in effect, reminding us we were simply at the beginning of the negotiating process. So no flames fanned, but it may not be long until Theresa May feels the heat. Ahead of a divided Labour Party in the polls, she may be at the zenith of her political popularity. Because now her own party's apparent unity is set to be tested. If some of her own MPs don't like the size of any proposed financial settlement, they may not only suggest it's better to walk away with no deal, but attempt to apply pressure to this end. That in turn might lead to the largely self-muting Remainers in her ranks to find their voice. And there are more time bombs in Tusk's draft guidelines. If Theresa May wants a transitional deal, she will have to accept a "supervisory" regime for a time - presumably the European Court of Justice whose jurisdiction she wants to end. So UKIP are likely to claim by the next election that we are still "half-in, half out". And with the EU refusing to do a final trade deal until after the UK has left, it may be difficult for her to demonstrate the benefits of leaving - allowing the Liberal Democrats to claim we should never have cast aside single market membership in the first place. It's an old political adage but one with which Theresa May will be familiar: "you cannot please all of the people all of the time." But she may find it a challenge to please some of the people some of the time, even in her own party.	A tale of two sentences, drafted in two different capitals, exposes the clear blue water between London and Brussels.
Media playback is not supported on this device Like Cook before him, Root has been promoted from vice-captain, an elevation such a formality that the anointing of another leader would have come as a seismic shock. But an expected coronation does not guarantee that the crown will sit right, especially when Root is such an inexperienced skipper. Why is he the man for the job? What type of leader might he be? And how will it affect his batting? Root has long been tipped for the top job. As a 13-year-old playing club cricket for Sheffield Collegiate he was nicknamed 'FEC', for 'future England captain', a title once bestowed on Michael Atherton with similar accuracy. Since he made his debut at the age of 21 in December 2012, no batsman on the planet has made more than Root's 4,594 Test runs and only India's Virat Kohli has a better tally in all international cricket. He is perhaps the most complete three-format player that England have ever produced. The English way is to push the batting totem towards leadership - it was the same with Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Cook, with varying degrees of success. Now it is Root's turn. Although his leadership experience amounts to only four first-class matches, the tiny glimpses offered when he has briefly deputised for Cook hint towards an enthusiasm and dynamism for the job. At 26, he is a year older than Atherton when he took charge, but a year younger than Cook was. With 53 Tests to his name, he has 22 more than Vaughan when he was named skipper in 2003. "He's the obvious candidate," said England pace bowler James Anderson. "The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected. "He is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man. "Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man." Root hasn't quite been named captain by default, but it's not far off. Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler were all consulted after Cook's resignation, but it always seemed incredibly unlikely that any would beat Root to the job. Still, there is the suggestion that Root's carefree, jovial approach might not be best suited to leadership. "Root is the outstanding candidate, but you wouldn't want it to be a case of making your best player captain, only for it to backfire on you later," said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann. "I'm still not convinced Root is the right man for the job. I want him to concentrate on being the best player we have ever had, rather than having his talent curbed by the pressures of captaincy. "He has tried to be more sensible later, but part of his cheeky chappy persona makes him the player he is, and I don't want to see that taken away." And although Cook proclaimed Root to be "ready" for the captaincy during the tour of India, it was Root himself who said that he needs to "start growing up a bit" after an angry reaction to a dismissal in the fifth Test in Chennai. Fatherhood should help, a first-born son having arrived on 7 January, but if it is a different Root who leads England out against South Africa at Lord's on 6 July, will he have the same success that brought him to the captaincy? "It's hard to say how ready I am," said Root in January. "I've got quite a lot experience in Test cricket now, but it's one of these things where you have to learn on the job. "Being a dad you don't know what to do, you just have to go with it and see how it goes. I imagine being captain would be very similar." It is a downside of central contracts that England players have little or no opportunity to learn captaincy in the county game. Arguably, another related negative is that a player can only ever be schooled by the limited number of captains he has played under. Root, for example, has never played a Test under anyone other than Cook, while Cook's style of leadership was heavily influenced by predecessor Andrew Strauss. With just those four first-class matches under his belt, Root is one of the most inexperienced captains ever appointed by England - at least Cook had benefited from 18 months in charge of the one-day side. Root's style of leadership is therefore something of a mystery. The perception is that he will be more adventurous than Cook - but so is popping to the corner shop in your slippers instead of your shoes. "Joe will know what he would like to improve or what he would like to do differently," said former England captain Vaughan. "When all the speculation over Cook's future began, he will have gone home at night and thought 'what if I do get the job?' "But you're never too sure how you're going to be as a person until you get it. You can think you're going to be X or Y, but you can't be 100% sure." Of the four times Root has led in the first-class game, one match was in charge of England Lions, with the other three as Yorkshire skipper. In each of Root's matches as Tykes captain, fast bowler Ryan Sidebottom was part of the Yorkshire team. "I get changed next to him and he can be a scruffy little git, but when it comes to cricket knowledge he's very clued up and knows everything about the game," said Sidebottom. "If you look at the way he bats, he's got all the shots. He works hard on innovation, so I think he will be a creative captain. "When he plays, he takes the game to the opposition. The English way can be quite conservative; I'm sure he'll change that for the better." Media playback is not supported on this device It is incredibly English to fret over how taking on the responsibility of captaincy might affect the new leader's batting (they are almost always batsmen, after all). However, of the seven men with the most Tests as England captain, only one - Vaughan - has an average significantly worse as captain than when in the ranks. The batting records of Cook, Strauss and Nasser Hussain are similar whether captain or not, while Atherton, Peter May and Graham Gooch saw their runs increase with responsibility, the latter two dramatically so. It is not just English leaders with lengthy tenures who have seen a spike in their scoring. Of Root, India's Kohli, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson - widely regarded as the four finest batsmen on the planet right now - the Englishman is the last of the quartet to take over as his nation's Test captain. Each has seen an improvement in his batting average, Williamson by a small amount, Kohli and Smith by more than 20 runs each. Realistically, though, England would probably settle for Root's record to hold steady. His batting average of 52.80 is the highest by any England player to have played at least 20 innings since 1968. Any improvement on that would be pretty remarkable. The status quo of Cook leading the Test side and Eoin Morgan taking charge of the one-day and Twenty20 outfits worked well for England because neither was a threat to the other. Both were miles away from getting into the teams they did not lead. Three-format man Root's elevation to lead the Test side poses a problem for the England and Wales Cricket Board. Do they leave Morgan, who has presided over an incredible improvement in England's one-day cricket and guided them to the World Twenty20 final, in charge, or give Root three sets of reins? Those in favour of change will say there are very few examples of a Test captain playing for too long under a different limited-overs skipper, while any dip in results or form could increase pressure on Morgan. However, director of cricket Strauss' crusade to bring limited-overs success to the England side has seen greater and greater separation between the red-ball and the white-ball teams. One skipper for all could be seen as a return to a uniform approach that had largely been abandoned. And the relentless scheduling of international cricket more than justifies two skippers, particularly if resting Root from the shorter formats helps him cope with the mental and physical demands of Test leadership. Consider the winter schedule of 2017-18. The five Ashes Tests that begin at the end of November are followed by an ODI series against Australia, which rolls into a T20 tri-series also involving New Zealand. After that, England play five more ODIs and two Tests against the Kiwis, which might not conclude until the end of March. A player involved in all parts of that tour could be on the other side of the world for five months or more. Even two captains might not be enough. England captains have a natural shelf-life. Of the seven skippers with the most Tests, discounting any time as a stand-in, only May's reign spanned more than five years - and that ended in 1961. Of the longest-serving skippers since the late 1980s, Gooch managed five years, Atherton four, Hussain four, Vaughan five (with an enforced 18-month break because of a knee injury), Strauss four and Cook just over four. From the seven longest serving of all-time, Cook has taken charge of most matches thanks to the Test-hungry nature of the ECB's scheduling department. That Root's tenure begins with five Test-free months is an anomaly, but one that will soon be compensated for. Over the succeeding 14 months or so, England will cram in 21 Tests. If we take July to be the proper start to Root's reign and assume that the fickle mistresses of form, fitness and results allow him to be in charge for four and a half years, then his spell as skipper could end with the 2021-22 Ashes in Australia. By then, he could have been at the helm for more than 60 Tests - an England record - and, at his current rate of scoring, will have become the second Englishman to reach 10,000 runs. He will have just turned 31, so will still feasibly have half a decade of Test batting left in him, much like Cook does now. At the point, a 25-year-old Haseeb Hameed could be the next unsurprising candidate to be given the keys to the kingdom.	In the least surprising move since England last needed a new Test captain, England have appointed Joe Root as the successor to Alastair Cook.
Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016. Read said of the 25-year-old: "Last winter he got fitter and stronger. "Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball." Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad. "Jake is in fantastic form with the ball," continued Read. "He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career." Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been "terrific" so far in 2016. "That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example," added Newell. Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.	Pace bowler Jake Ball has made a "lively" return following a winter playing for England Lions, says Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read.
The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index grew to 50.1 from 49.4 in April, which had been the lowest reading since early 2013. The 50 mark separates manufacturing growth from contraction, with the sector now just on the positive side. Manufacturing failed to boost overall UK growth during 2015 and early 2016. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: "The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter. "There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general." The report found that more than a third of manufacturers surveyed believed uncertainty over the EU vote has had an impact on their business, with 8% saying the effect was "strongly detrimental". The survey showed the investment goods industry experienced a difficult month, with production falling at the quickest pace since early 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the manufacturing sector was "essentially at a standstill in May". Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small improvement for manufacturing in May did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector. "Granted, the headline PMI index recovered from its three-year low in April, ticking up from an upwardly revised 49.4 to 50.1 in May, above the consensus expectation of 49.6," she said. Ms Miller said this was still far below the average since the economic recovery picked up at the start of 2013. However, she thought the situation would "improve for UK manufacturers later this year". Overall new orders rose in May. Meanwhile, some firms said they were already pricing in the expectation that inflation will rise. Annual consumer price inflation currently stands at 0.3%.	UK manufacturing activity rose slightly in May, raising concerns over the economy's strength in the run-up to the 23 June European Union referendum.
The final member of the family, a male marmoset called Gomez, was found by police on Monday, having been abandoned on a vets' doorstep. A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A$5,000 (Â£3,000, $3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. "Ay, check out my monkey," wrote the third person, according to court documents. "That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. "Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed," the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft.  The zoo said the marmoset enclosure is currently closed "to give the family privacy".	Three rare pygmy marmosets have been rescued and are set to be reunited, after being stolen from a Sydney zoo at the weekend.
Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received €40m and his former club, Santos, was paid €17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40% of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: "They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice." The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated €13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen $47m (£33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.	Brazilian football star Neymar has appeared in court in connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to FC Barcelona.
The runaway critter was spotted on top of the house in Cambridgeshire. Fenland Animal Rescue was called in, but it was "a bit of a wrestle as he was not the friendliest of raccoons", said the charity's Josh Flanagan. "That said, I've never met one before, and we don't train in raccoon rescue techniques," he added. They are hoping to locate the animal's owner. Click here for more news from Cambridgeshire "Raccoons aren't native to this country, so he must have escaped from somewhere," Mr Flanagan said. "You can imagine their surprise when the householders saw one on their roof. "The woman thought her husband had lost the plot, but when she looked out, there it was, staring back at her through the window." With the animal jumping from the house to a garden shed roof, it was a short game of "cat and mouse" as Mr Flanagan tried to catch him. "At one point I was sat on the rooftop with him, and we were both eating bananas. I don't think I'll ever experience anything like that again, but it's why I do this job," he said. Eventually the animal was brought down safely, using a control pole. A few days after its ordeal, the racoon is settling in - but "causing havoc" - at the rescue centre's Whittlesey base. "He's a devilish boy, a bit vicious," Mr Flanagan said. "They look all cute and adorable, but they're not." If no one comes forward to claim him, he will be moved to a specialist rescue centre "where he can live his life in a safe and secure environment with other raccoons to call friends".	A woman thought her husband had "lost the plot" when he woke her up to tell her there was a raccoon on their roof.
The Premier League club say the 22-year-old left-back is expected to be sidelined for "up to eight weeks" after the knock in a 6-1 loss to Bournemouth. "The Scottish international damaged his calf during the second half of the defeat," said a club statement. Scotland will face England in World Cup qualifying Group F on 11 November. Gordon Strachan's side sit three points behind leaders England after three games. The Scotland head coach had remarked before this month's 1-1 draw with Lithuania that his squad had "incredible" strength in depth at left-back. Robertson started at Hampden but picked up a knock and Celtic's Kieran Tierney took over for the 3-0 defeat in Slovakia. Hull were 3-1 down at the Vitality Stadium when they lost Robertson to injury after 63 minutes, defeat knocking them down to 16th, two places and one point above the relegation spots. The game was Mike Phelan's first since his appointment as head coach until the end of the season following a spell as caretaker. The left-back said on Twitter: "Looks like I'll be a supporter for the next few weeks! Hopefully the lads can kick on." Robertson's Scotland team-mate, goalkeeper David Marshall, has endured a miserable spell since his transfer from Cardiff City, conceding 15 goals in his first four outings for the Tigers.	Andrew Robertson will miss Scotland's trip to Wembley to face England and up to 10 games for Hull City after suffering a calf injury.
Andrew Barrett, 32, from Norfolk, worked for the East of England Ambulance Service but resigned when he was charged. The girl was aged 14 and 15 when she was sexually assaulted in summer 2013 and May last year. Barrett, of Rayners Way, Mattishall, who was not on duty when he committed the offences, was jailed for 16 months. Norwich Crown Court heard the father of one met the girl while doing voluntary work and began sending her sexually explicit messages on Whats App and by text. He also texted the girl naked photographs of himself and became "persistent in his requests" for her to do the same, the court was told. Martin Ivory, prosecuting, said she eventually sent him five pictures. During the first sexual assault, he hugged her when she became upset and touched her indecently. The second took place while he was driving and she was in the passenger seat. He again touched her indecently. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the girl said she became anxious every time she heard an ambulance siren and at the prospect of ever having to call an ambulance. She said she had nightmares and had self-harmed. David Wilson, defending, said Barrett had been a man of "exemplary conduct" and had worked for the ambulance service for 13 years. Disregarding Mr Wilson's call for a suspended sentence, Judge Antony Bate said: "I would be failing in my public duty if I didn't send you to prison immediately today."	A paramedic who admitted sexually assaulting a teenager and possessing indecent images of her has been jailed.
US media report that Tori Castillo, 39, is facing child abuse charges and the children are now with their father. Onlookers in the car park instructed the five-year-old on how to open the boot from the inside, reports say. Passersby had noticed the car shaking and noise coming from inside where it was parked outside a Walmart. The incident happened on Thursday in Riverdale, Utah. It is not clear how long the children were in the boot. Local police officer Casey Warren told KTVX: "It's never right to lock a child inside of a vehicle, let alone a trunk of a vehicle. "Obviously there's a lot of things that could go wrong." He praised the "good Samaritans" who helped the children get out. Under Utah state law, leaving a child under the age of nine unattended in a vehicle is punishable by a fine or jail time. The law was enacted in 2011 after repeated cases of children dying unattended in hot cars.	A woman has been arrested in the US after allegedly locking her children, aged two and five, in the boot of her car while she went shopping.
Australian ship Ocean Shield is first investigating a possible third signal elsewhere in the massive search zone. None has been confirmed as coming from the flight recorders of MH370. Meanwhile families of the missing passengers have attended a prayer service in Kuala Lumpur. By Nick ChildsWorld affairs correspondent, BBC News Pursuing those pulses The plane disappeared four weeks ago with 239 people on board. Investigators believe it crashed in the Indian Ocean although no confirmed debris has been found. Australian co-ordinators said on Sunday that new analysis of satellite data meant efforts would now focus on the southern part of the search zone, near where China's vessel is located. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said China's Haixan 01 had redetected a signal for about 90 seconds on Saturday, within hours of it being heard earlier. He said the latest discovery was about 2km (1.2 miles) away from the original pulse, and that China had also reported spotting white objects on the surface of the water about 90km away. "The fact that we have two detections - two acoustic events - in that location provides some promise," he said. However he said these signals were "fleeting encounters" that could not be verified until the arrival of British naval ship HMS Echo and Australian defence vessel Ocean Shield. Both vessels have technology able to detect underwater signals emitted by "black box" data recorders. HMS Echo arrived around 15:45 GMT on Sunday. The depth of the water in this zone is said to be about 4.5km (2.8 miles). Ocean Shield - described by officials as the best equipped vessel taking part in the search - will head there once it has investigated a third acoustic detection about 300 nautical miles away (560km). It is not expected to reach the southern area for over a day. As crews began day 30 of the search on Sunday, Air Chief Marshal Houston told reporters investigators were "running out of time" in the search for the flight's "black box". The battery-powered signal from recorder can begin to fade after 30 days. Thousands of people, including families of the missing passengers, attended the prayer service in the Malaysian capital on Sunday. "This is not a prayer for the dead because we have not found bodies. This is a prayer for blessings and that the plane will be found," said Liow Tiong Lai, the president of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), one of the parties in the governing coalition. A dozen military aircraft and 13 ships are searching three areas about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) north-west of the Australian city of Perth. What we know The search for flight MH370 Pursuing those pulses The areas cover a total of 216,000 sq km (560,000 square km). Haixun 01 picked up the first so-called "ping" signal at about 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, state-run Xinhua news agency said. The signal reportedly had a frequency of 37.5kHz - the same as that emitted by the flight recorders. Three people on board the boat were said to have heard the pings, which were not recorded as they came suddenly. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March. Malaysia earlier announced it had set up three ministerial committees to help co-ordinate the search, and a new investigation team which would include members from Australia, China, the US, the UK and France.	A UK ship with sophisticated detection equipment, HMS Echo, has arrived in an area where a Chinese vessel searching for the missing Malaysian plane has twice detected a pulse signal.
Hampshire, who chose to bowl, had Essex 0-1 when Nick Browne was caught off the bowling of Fidel Edwards. Rain then caused a lengthy delay, but Cook (114 not out) and Westley (111) dominated when play resumed. Kyle Abbott finally ended their stand, bowling Westley with the last ball of the day as Essex closed on 243-2. England opener Cook's ton was his second of the season, with the former Test captain averaging 81.75 with the bat through five first-class innings this season. He was ably supported by Westley, whose century was his first of the season in first-class cricket. Hampshire could take few positives from a difficult first day, especially after a shoulder injury to fast bowler Edwards, but Abbott's late removal of Westley will leave them with some hope of limiting the hosts' score. Essex batsman Tom Westley: "It's good to get that first score out of the way. That first Championship hundred of the season is always nice. It was tough going, but it's pleasing to get some runs. What's most pleasing is the position we're in after being put in to bat. "We would have wanted to bowl first in those conditions. It did nip around in the first hour and a half. It's a good cricketing wicket, but there is definitely a bit in it for the bowlers, but also if they miss their length you feel you score. "I don't think Cookie will mind me saying we both played and missed. On another day you can nick them and we can be 100 for three or four. But sometimes you have to ride the luck and Cookie's was a chanceless hundred. They bowled well at him, so it wasn't easy going. It's great having him at the other end. He just loves scoring runs. He's a huge asset for the club." Hampshire coach Craig White: "We'll assess Fidel Edwards' injury in the morning, but it looks a bit sore and he'll struggle to take a further part in the game. "Every game it seems this year we've had a bowler go down. It's not ideal, it's just frustrating. Injuries happen I know but when it happens every game and you're a bowler down you wonder if you're doing something wrong." "It was a frustrating day. At the start we wouldn't have thought they'd only be two wickets down at the end of play. I'm a little bit shocked really. It was great conditions to bowl in and we probably early on didn't get enough balls consistently in the right areas. But you have to take your hat off to those two. They played really well."	Alastair Cook and Tom Westley both hit centuries as Essex took charge on a rain-affected first day against Hampshire in the County Championship.
The 21-year-old is eligible to face Macclesfield on Saturday. Former Port Vale player Jefford has made 27 appearances for Welling this season. "Ben is a good young player that we potentially feel is a league player," Rovers assistant boss Jamie Day told BBC Wiltshire. "He has gained some good experience."	National League side Forest Green Rovers have signed defender Ben Jefford on an 18-month contract from Welling.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
Protesters have been on the the streets since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April - a week after a police encounter where he sustained unexplained injuries. Shops have been looted and objects thrown at police, injuring several officers. It was the first time in the history of professional baseball that fans had been locked out of a game. The game at Camden Yards started at 14:05 EDT due to the city's 22:00 curfew in the wake of the riots, with Baltimore winning 8-2. Among the few able to witness the match were those who had paid for balcony rooms in the nearby Hilton Hotel, which overlooks the stadium. Journalists accredited to cover the game reported that the voices of players on the infield could be heard clearly. "Attention media: For record-keeping purposes, today's official paid attendance is ... zero," an announcement made over the press box public address system said. Other reports said the stadium still played the traditional US baseball anthem - Take Me Out To The Ballgame - during the traditional seventh-inning stretch. The Orioles and Major League Baseball officials had said the decision to shut out fans had been taken for safety reasons. But Brendan Hurson, one of the 40 spectators gathered by a fence near the stadium's main gate, said it was a missed opportunity and held up a sign reading "Don't forget Freddie Gray". Six police officers have been suspended following Gray's death and an internal investigation is under way. On Sunday, more than 1,000 protesters were on the streets of Baltimore and at least 12 arrests made. Gray, who was 25, is the latest of a series of black Americans to die in police custody in recent months, triggering angry protests accusing the police of brutality.	Fans were locked out of Baltimore Orioles' game against Chicago White Sox following violent protests in the city.
Tory sources have said Mr Reckless, the AM for South Wales East, has held talks with Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives. An announcement is due on Thursday which would see Mr Reckless join the Tory group in Cardiff Bay. It is understood Mr Reckless will be an independent AM rather than re-join the Conservative Party. There is resistance to re-admitting Mr Reckless following his dramatic defection from the Conservatives to join UKIP in September 2014. The then-MP fought and won a by-election in his Rochester and Strood seat in November that year, but lost his seat in the May 2015 General Election. He was elected to the Assembly in May 2016 as UKIP won their first seats in Cardiff Bay, and he is currently chairman of the Climate Change, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee. He had also worked as a researcher for MP Douglas Carswell, who left UKIP last month. The move would mean the Conservative group would become the second-largest, with 12 seats to Plaid Cymru's 11.	UKIP AM Mark Reckless is set to quit the party and vote with the Conservative group in the Assembly.
The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by pause for a moment. But the emotional scars of the tragedy that took place will live on for a generation. For 57-year-old Sabi, they're still raw. He runs the boat club on the beach, used principally by customers of the Hotel Imperial, targeted that day. He points to the spot where the gunman opened fire, appearing first to make a phone call, before throwing his mobile into the sea and beginning his killing spree. "People all around me were falling", he recalls, "and I just grabbed as many customers as I could and ran." They went through a staff gate to a basement of the hotel - but Sabi returned to bring more to safety. "I saw six of our loyal customers die, people who always came to this hotel. They were like brothers to me. This beach should be full of life now. But it's deserted." Sabi pauses, looking at the rows of empty sunbeds. "We will fight", he says, his lip quivering, tears welling up. "At least we can still smile". Tunisia is a nation in shock - and its tourism lifeline is under serious threat. Thousands of holidaymakers have already left on emergency flights laid on by tour operators. I watched as another busload from the Hotel Imperial arrived at the local Enfidha airport on Saturday night, heading for Manchester. Among them was one man whose fiancee had died in front of him. Most were too traumatised to talk. But in the hotels beside the Imperial, dozens are staying put. "I wanted to leave early", says Isabelle Campbell from Gateshead, "but my husband said: if we go, they win. I'm not relaxed though, I'm nervous about going to the beach." Her husband, Bob Taylor, says they ventured down earlier and saw a speed-boat manoeuvring in the water, revving its engines towards them. "For a moment, we thought: Oh God, something is going to happen again. We used to go to Egypt but changed to Tunisia because of the security threat there", he adds. "Now we don't know what'll happen here." One in ten Tunisians works in the tourism industry. It took a hit after the attack on the Bardo museum in March - and is now widely expected to plummet. The fear of that has only added to Tunisians' anguish over a worrying rise in Islamist attacks. The birthplace of the Arab Spring, which was widely praised for its largely peaceful transition to democracy, now has more people fighting in Syria and Iraq than any other country: an estimated 3,000 Tunisians are thought to be there, many feared to have joined so-called Islamic State (IS). A once peaceful Arab democracy has been shaken by the chaos and civil conflict of neighbouring Libya, where IS has taken root and is thought to train increasing numbers of Tunisians crossing a porous border. It is all a vast challenge for Tunisia's new coalition government, which has scrambled to announce a security clampdown, including the closure of 80 mosques suspected of being breeding grounds for radical Islam. Critics say the reaction has been too late. "These people want to destroy Tunisia," says Dorra Brahem, a local student, walking on the beach with her sister Aisha and friend Fatma.

The space agency has set out a three part plan, which it hopes will eventually lead to humans living on Mars by the 2030s. Unlike the Moon, humans have never physically set foot on Mars, we've only ever used robots like the Curiosity Rover. By exploring Mars with robots for the last 40 years Nasa has found out lots about our neighbouring planet, including the recent discovery that there is flowing icy water under the crust. They hope that this huge mission will help us to learn even more about not just Mars, but Earth as well. So, how will they do it? Since 2010 Nasa has been testing out the effects of what living in space can do to the human body, to prepare them for the journey to Mars, and also for living there. They have done this by sending astronauts to live onboard the International Space Station for long periods of time. Nasa also sent a team of scientists to live in a "Mars-like" dome for a year near a volcano on Earth, to see if the team can live happily on their own, away from everyday human-life. They are also doing a number of tests on Mars spacesuits and are currently trying out technology which could be used on the planet. In the "Proving Ground" part of their plan, Nasa hope to be able to do experiments in a "deep space" environment which will allow scientists and astronauts to return to Earth in a matter of days. Most of these experiments will take place in the Moon's orbit. Some of their plans include teaming up with the European Space Agency as part of their Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission in 2020, which aims to take a large asteroid from a near-Earth orbit, and move it to travel around the Moon instead. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will then explore the asteroid in the 2020s, and return to Earth with samples. NASA will also be testing out its powerful new systems such as the Space Launch System rocket and Solar Electric Propulsion, which would be used for sending supplies to the team, and also for long space travel. Nasa will build a new rover robot to join the Curiosity rover in 2020. It will have lots of new gadgets to test out on Mars. One of these gadgets is called MOXIE, and will be trying to make oxygen, which is an important part of the air we breathe here on Earth, from carbon dioxide, which is in the atmosphere on Mars, Researchers will also be investigating ways astronauts can recycle better in space. In the "Earth Independent" phase of Nasa's plan, they hope to be able to send humans to Mars, using all the research and new technology they discovered in the previous phases. At the moment it takes around eight months to travel to Mars, but scientists are looking into ways to reduce this time. By 2030 Nasa are hoping they will be able to send people to the edges and surface of Mars, not just to visit, but also to live there for a long period of time. They will be looking into ways to make fuel, water, oxygen and building materials on the Red planet. Nasa will also be looking into improving their communications systems with Earth, to allow for quicker exchanges of research and data For years scientists have been curious about the Red planet, and whether or not humans would be able to live there. Recent research has proved that there is water on the planet, and that at one point Mars' climate was perhaps similar to that on Earth. Robot rovers are also looking for the possibility of whether there is alien life there too. Sending humans to the planet could help speed up the research and allow us to better understand the history of Mars. Nasa are also curious to find out if studying Mars could help us find out more about our own planet, and even how our solar system was born. However Nasa could be pipped to the post in the race to Mars, as a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands has said they will land humans on Mars by 2027.	Nasa has revealed its plans to try to get humans living on Mars in the next few decades.
It will be the first concerted use of an emerging technique called Crispr to "snip out" specific disease genes in order to discover drugs. The technique is cheaper, faster and more accurate than current methods. The research will be carried out with four leading academic and industrial gene-research centres across the world. AZ vice-president Dr Lorenz Mayr hopes it will speed the development of medicines for illnesses including diabetes, heart disease and many cancers "You can't stop the science," he told BBC News. "It is one of the biggest developments in the area of biotechnology in decades." Many serious illnesses occur when genes in the human body go wrong. The human genome project determined that humans had about 24,000 genes. These are found along the DNA double helix in every cell in the body. The decoding of the human genome 15 years ago led to the hope that doctors would eventually identify faulty genes responsible for specific diseases and eventually develop medicines to treat them. The principle is simple - drug companies would "snip out" the gene responsible for the disease from the patient's DNA, then use it to test drugs to see if they could fix the problem. At the time, US President Bill Clinton said: "Our children's children will only know cancer as a constellation of stars," and hailed the completion of the project after a 10-year race that cost billions. And Tony Blair, then UK Prime Minister, who joined the Mr Clinton by satellite from Downing Street, added: "Every so often in the history of human endeavour, there comes a breakthrough that takes mankind across the frontier and into a new era." Fifteen years on, one could wonder: "What new era?" There are only a handful of new medicines based on the human genome project, and, although Mr Clinton may eventually be proved right, cancer is still known as "cancer". Progress has been hampered by two main factors. First, researches soon began to realise that most common illnesses were caused by any combination of tens of genes. Second, the genetic techniques to snip out specific genes are expensive and take a long time. Researchers have to make what are in effect "genetic scissors" tailor-made to the gene they want to snip out. This process can take months for each and every gene. But in recent years, scientists have developed a set of genetic scissors that can be quickly and cheaply tailored to cut out a specific gene. And this technique, called Crispr, will be the focus of the research programme. Dr Kosuke Yusa, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, one of the academic organisations involved in the project, said "this powerful technology" would enable "researchers to target genes with incredible specificity". Also involved are the Innovative Genomics Initiative, a joint venture between the University of California, Berkeley, and University of California in San Francisco, the Broad Institute/Whitehead Institute and Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are both based in  Massachusetts.

The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city. Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school. Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting. Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April. Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening. He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police. He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt. India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms. In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi.	A man arrested on suspicion of shooting a female student dead and wounding another at a school in India has been remanded in custody.
Tenants cleared from Glancalvie Estate set up a camp in Croick Churchyard, near Ardgay, 170 years ago. Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today. A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum. Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate. They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands. With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother. She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel. Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum. Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter. To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August. Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times. Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to "improve" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films. Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June. Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross. The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony. Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes. Sutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home. It will be free of dialogue.	A wine decanter taken from a church during the Highland Clearances and used by evicted families to feed milk to babies has been gifted to a museum.
Newport's win over Accrington sees the Exiles leapfrog Pools, putting them two points in front with two games remaining. Victory for Barnet, under caretaker boss Rossi Eames, was only their second win in 13 games. But they controlled the match throughout against a side lacking in confidence, belief and ability. John Akinde was denied an opener after 12 minutes when his angled header was tipped over for a corner. From the set-piece Michael Nelson, the Barnet skipper, fired a shot against a post, while Jack Taylor's goal-bound shot was deflected wide. Nathan Thomas got Pools' first shot on target after 64 minutes, failing to test goalkeeper Josh Vickers. And the Bees went ahead in the 66th minute when Akinde turned and powerfully fired an angled drive past goalkeeper Joe Fryer. Simeon Akinola made it two five minutes later, the Bees racing away down the left side and Jamal Campbell-Ryce setting up the substitute. Akinde also missed a penalty, Fryer saving his weak spot kick with nine minutes remaining. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.

Many more are feared trapped under rubble after hundreds of buildings collapsed. Thousands of people have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters and mosques. Some have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed, others have fled their homes amid fears of aftershocks and a possible tsunami. Rescue workers used diggers to remove rubble in their search efforts overnight on Wednesday. Others used their bare hands and shovels to find people. A few survivors were pulled out alive on Wednesday. More than 200 buildings were either seriously damaged or toppled in the earthquake. The Pidie Jaya region, on the north Aceh coast, was the hardest hit. The tremor hit just offshore early on Wednesday morning. Many of the homes in the area have corrugated tin roofs which collapsed. Hundreds have also been rushed to the sole functioning hospital, which has been overwhelmed by patients. Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake.	A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province in Indonesia on Wednesday, killing at least 97 people.
Sean Earle snatched the bag of Linda Clarke, who had cut her wrists and walked out of hospital before sitting on a ledge over the M602 in Salford. After she fell to the ground, the 26-year-old "saw his opportunity" to steal her bag before running off, Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court heard. Earle, of Trevelyan Street, Salford, was bailed until sentencing on 17 July. Mrs Clarke, who had two daughters and was a full-time carer of her autistic son, walked out of Salford Royal Hospital in the early hours of 17 April. CCTV footage showed Earle walking the same way before approaching her as she made her way to the bridge nearby. A driver, who saw Mrs Clarke and Earle on the bridge, decided to turn back to check on her welfare. He saw Earle running away and realised the 55-year-old woman had "gone over the wall and is lying on the carriageway", prosecutor Shazia Aslam said. Police were called but Mrs Clarke, who was also a grandmother, was pronounced dead in hospital. It was then discovered that her handbag was missing and a policeman identified Earle from the CCTV footage. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Clarke's husband Gary said his wife's death had devastated the family and Earle had "added to our pain" with his "despicable" theft. Lorna Wincote, defending, said Earle was not charged with anything related to Mrs Clarke's death after an "extensive" police investigation. "He is also a person who suffers from his own mental health issues," she added.	A man has admitted stealing the handbag of a female carer after she fell to her death from a motorway bridge.
BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season. There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation. Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading. Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third. Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively. Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men. Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time. Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes. Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today. Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals. It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011. Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought. The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City. He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1. Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put £300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a 'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north. "Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment," Way told BBC Somerset. "This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team." Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints. Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win. Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One. The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone. David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches. Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory. "We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net," Brass told BBC Radio Manchester. It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars. Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf. Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins. "I'm delighted," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. "It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team. "They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling." Take part in our new Premier League Predictor game, which allows you to create leagues with friends.	They say that Christmas is the time for charity but there are going to be a few football managers across the country wishing their players had not been quite so generous this year.
Thomas Baker, known as Tommy, was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on 27 January. The 44-year-old, from Everton, had been shot in the head and chest. He died later in hospital. The three Liverpool men arrested - two aged 29 and the other 32 - remain in police custody for questioning. Merseyside Police said Mr Baker had left Phoenix Gym at the market shortly before he was shot while getting into his car. Detectives believe those involved in the shooting had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour. Det Ch Insp Bev Hyland said officers were still searching for a silver VW polo, which "left the scene at speed" and travelled along a number of roads including Balmoral Road, Molyneux Road and Queens Road. She added that a number of people captured on CCTV near the meat market had yet to come forward and while "they may not think what they saw would be of any significance, they could have information which is key to our inquiries".	Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the shooting of a man at a meat market.
The Commons' Home Affairs Committee said the UK Border Agency should challenge unacceptable behaviour by some of its contractors. The report comes 15 months after a deportee died on a flight. A spokesman for the UKBA said that all private security escorts are trained in approved restraint techniques. Jimmy Mubenga, 46, fell ill and collapsed on a British Airways plane bound for Angola on 12 October 2010. The MPs did not comment on the case, which is still being investigated by the police, but said that Mr Mubenga's death had triggered their own investigations into the way that the UK Border Agency managed the deportation of people on flights from the UK. The UKBA contracts out the job of escorting people to their deportation flight. The contract has been held by Reliance since May 2011 and previously by G4S. The MPs said found: "It is a matter for serious concern that contractors should use racist language among themselves," said the report. "That they were content to do so in front of not only UK Border Agency staff but also inspectors from HM Inspectorate of Prisons is shocking. It is possibly the result of a relationship between the Agency and its contractors which had become too cosy." Restraint techniques The MPs said that the UKBA's own staff should feel that they can properly challenge any bad behaviour by contractors - but it also criticised the practice of taking "reserves" to airports - people who may then find that they are not being removed from the UK after all. It called on the government to allow independent monitors, people allowed into prisons and removal centres, to board removal flights. The MPs said that they were not convinced that a potentially harmful head-down restraint position was never used, even though it was not authorised. A recent expert report found that such techniques could lead to death. "We recommend that the Home Office issue urgent guidance to all staff involved in enforced removals about the danger of seated restraint techniques in which the subject is bent forwards. "We also recommend that the Home Office commission research into control and restraint techniques which are suitable for use on an aircraft. The use by contractors of unauthorised restraint techniques, sanctioning their use, or failing to challenge their use, should be grounds for dismissal." Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: "The UK Border Agency must not wash its hands of responsibility for detainees just because the service is contracted out. "People who are not entitled to remain in the country must be removed and there may be occasions when it is necessary to use physical force, but this must always be done only when absolutely necessary, and with proper respect for the dignity of the detainee." A UKBA spokesman said: "All escorts on flights are trained to use restraint techniques approved by the Prison Service. "We have no evidence contractors use head-down restraints and would take strong action against them if their conduct does not meet our standards. "We are currently working closely with Noms (National Offender Management Service) to develop specific techniques appropriate to confined spaces."	Private security guards employed to forcibly remove people from the UK have used racist language and inappropriate force, a report by MPs has said.
No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful. And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA ("there is no alternative"). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.	I haven't been in Greece for three weeks but I am told it is eerily quiet and - in respect of tourism - surprisingly busy.
Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day and Five Go Parenting will catch up with the sleuthing children as adults. The series, written by Bruno Vincent, follows on from the success of the recent Ladybird book spoofs for adults. The original 21 books featured Julian, George, Dick, Anne and their dog Timmy. Their escapades, set during the '40s and '50s, saw the children having virtually adult-free outdoor holidays where they solved mysteries while drinking lashings of ginger beer. Famous titles include Five on a Treasure Island and Five Go to Smuggler's Top. A film parody, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was also made by the Comic Strip team for Channel 4 and featured Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French and Adrian Edmondson. They went on to make another film called Five Go Mad on Mescalin. The books have also been made into films, TV series and cartoons, as well as audiobooks, comics and video games. Publisher Quercus said the five's grown-up adventures will "remind older readers of the unbreakable bond" between the children and "introduce newer readers to the spiffing time you can have with a few friends and a dog". It added the series brings characters - who are "posher than us and holidayed more than us" into our "baffling adult world". Their adult adventures will involve trying to give up alcohol, finding themselves on a puzzling "strategy away day", hunting for a good gluten-free cream tea and, "most perilous of all", preparing for parenthood. Anne McNeil of Enid Blyton Entertainment added they were "thrilled" with the new books, adding: "We are certain Enid Blyton would have delighted in the gentle parody of her characters - characters which have helped to create a multi-million-selling global brand." The books will be released in hardback on 3 November. The Famous Five series is among some of Blyton's most famous books, which also include Noddy and The Faraway Tree. In all, she produced more than 700 books, writing one a week at the peak of her powers. The British writer, who was born in 1897 and died in 1968, has sold more than 600 million books in total, which have been translated into 90 languages. In 2008, a survey by the Costa Book Awards saw Blyton voted the "most-loved author", beating Roald Dahl, JK Rowling and Jane Austen. Michael Joseph's Ladybird Books for Grown-Ups series, which includes the Mid-Life Crisis and The Hipster, has sold 1.74 million copies grossing Â£10m to date, according to The Bookseller.	A spoof series of four books called Enid Blyton for Grown-Ups, which reimagines the Famous Five as adults, is to be published.
Centre-left candidate Daniel Scioli led exit polls, and just edged centre-right Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri with most votes counted. Many had expected Mr Scioli to lead by a greater margin. The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round. With 96% of the votes counted, Mr Scioli was marginally ahead with 36.7% of the vote, while Mr Macri had 34.5%. To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival. "What happened today will change politics in this country," Mr Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, told supporters. Sergio Massa, a former ally turned rival of outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came a distant third with 21.3% of the vote and admitted defeat. Mr Massa has not said who will get his backing in the second round next month. With Mr Macri and Mr Scioli neck-and-neck, Mr Massa's support could prove crucial. Mr Scioli was handpicked as candidate by President Fernandez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. The governor of Buenos Aires province, he is a former world powerboating champion who lost his right arm in a race in 1989. Late on Sunday, he spoke before thousands of his supporters, saying: "United together we will triumph. I call upon the undecided and independent voters to join this cause." Last week, Mr Scioli pledged tax cuts for workers earning under a certain income, a move expected to affect half a million people. He has also vowed to bring down Argentina's inflation to single digits in less than four years and promises to introduce policy changes to invigorate the economy. Ms Fernandez, who stands down after eight years in power, says she leaves Argentines a better country. "We are voting today in a completely normal country," said Ms Fernandez said after casting her vote in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos. In previous decades, Argentines always went to the polls "in the middle of a serious crisis," she added. Ms Fernandez said achieving stability and leaving Argentines "a normal country" was the promise made by her late husband, Neston Kirchner, when he took office in 2003. He died in 2010, three years after handing over the presidency to his wife. Argentina elections: All to play for 14.5% Official, but disputed, inflation level 28.2% the inflation level in 2014, according to the World Bank 0.7% amount IMF predicts the economy will shrink in 2016 Whoever wins the presidency faces significant economic challenges. While the country gained strength after a financial crisis in 2002, its economy, the third-largest in Latin America, has slowed in recent years, with GDP growing by only 0.5% last year. The government is also locked in a battle against American hedge funds who disagree with how it wants to restructure $100bn (Â£65bn) of debt on which it defaulted in 2001. While the firms successfully sued Argentina for repayment, Ms Fernandez refused to pay.	Argentina will face a run-off election next month after neither presidential candidate gained enough votes to win the poll outright.
Sofia Legg's family was told there was a six-month waiting list for therapy despite an urgent GP referral for help. The inquest coroner in Taunton recorded a conclusion the 14-year-old had taken her own life by hanging. Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said it had apologised to the family and improvements had been made. The inquest heard Sofia, a student at Kings of Wessex Academy in Cheddar, had been suffering from low moods, was self-harming and was expressing thoughts about taking her own life. She was referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Services (CAMHS) in March 2015, but did not meet the criteria for specialist support. In February 2016, her GP made an urgent referral to CAMHS, after Sofia confessed to having suicidal thoughts. But after being seen twice by CAMHS in July 2016, she was told there was a six-month waiting list for cognitive behaviour therapy. Her family found her body when they returned home on the evening of 20 September. On the day before she died, a CAMHS worker met Sofia and her mother, giving a crisis plan stating her mother Sandy Legg needed "to watch her and keep a close eye on her". But investigation reports stated Sofia had to be "supervised at all times". "If constant supervision was necessary then this should have been stated directly to me before I left with Sofia," her mother told the hearing. Speaking after the inquest she added: "As a family we will forever mourn the loss of our kind, bright, beautiful daughter. "Sofia was failed by the system and we, as a family, feel badly let down." Somerset coroner Tony Williams said he would be following up his concerns about the death with the trust.	Mental health services failed a teenage girl who had suicidal thoughts, her family has said following an inquest into her death.
Following the revelations of inappropriate relationships, the home affairs select committee has called for an urgent review of laws governing undercover policing. Here are the women's accounts of how they felt when it emerged that their relationships, which lasted from two to six years, were based on deception. These are not their real names. "I was absolutely shocked and devastated," she told MPs. Lisa had a six-year relationship with former PC Mark Kennedy, who posed as long-haired dropout Mark "Flash" Stone to infiltrate a group of environmental protesters. "You imagine that somebody may be in public meetings that environmental groups have. You imagine there might be somebody listening in there. You could even imagine that your phone might be tapped or that somebody might look at your emails. "But to know that there was somebody in your bed for six years, that somebody was involved in your family life to such a degree, that was an absolute shock. "Well, 'shock' is an understatement. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me and my sense of what was reality and what wasn't was completely turned on its head." During the hearing she was asked whether she had any sympathy for Mr Kennedy, who is suing the Metropolitan Police claiming he had been traumatised by what had happened. "As a human being it is very difficult not to have sympathy for somebody that I cared about deeply, but it is also important to remember that that person that I cared about deeply did not in fact exist," she replied. She adds that she still has questions about what happened. "Who was listening in to our most intimate phone calls? Who saw our holiday photos? Was there anybody following us when we were on holiday? "Who made the decisions about what happened to my life, where I was allowed to go, who I was allowed to see, which I thought was my free will but actually was being manipulated by this person who was being controlled by other people?" "We weren't married, clearly, but we shared the same flat. He was completely integrated into my life for five years and then one day he disappeared," she said. Alison had a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy, who she met through a group she was involved with in 1994. But he was in fact an undercover police officer. She told MPs the revelation had an "enormous impact" on her life. "The experience has left me with many, many unanswered questions, and one of those that comes back is: how much of the relationship was real?," she told MPs. "Some of the consequences of that have meant that I have, for the last 13 years, questioned my own judgment and it has impacted seriously on my ability to trust, and that has impacted on my current relationship and other subsequent relationships. Alison, a peaceful campaigner involved in left-wing political causes, believes she inadvertently provided him with "an excellent cover story", helping persuade other activists he was genuine. She said he became totally integrated into her family, appearing in her mother's wedding photograph, accompanying her on holidays and supporting her through the bereavement of a close friend. "This is not about just a lying boyfriend or a boyfriend who has cheated on you. It is not even about a boyfriend who is having another relationship with somebody else. It is about a fictional character who was created by the state and funded by taxpayers' money." "You do not know who you can trust any more. It destroys everything," she said. When the boyfriend Clare knew as John Barker disappeared two years into their relationship, she was determined to track him down. She found a death certificate for his name, and discovered he had been using the identity of a child who had died of leukaemia aged eight. She visited the child's house, but their parents no longer lived there. "He had told me that his parents were dead when we were in a relationship, so I wasn't expecting to see the parents, but I thought that if I went there... he had been a missing person for however long and I was desperate to find him. I was really concerned about his welfare," she explained. "Nothing made sense of what had happened, and so I went there desperate, thinking I have to follow every clue that I have, and I thought maybe some other members of the family may still live there or somebody might know where he was." She said people trying to justify the practice saying things like it prevented terrorism, was very distressing. "This is not about a need to do it. It is about a desire to do it. They have the power and they think they can get away with it. That is what it is about. "It is deeply distressing, and I do not think it should be allowed in any circumstances. It is so intrusive into people's lives, and, as my friends have said, it turns your life upside down. "Everything that you thought you knew suddenly becomes unreal; everything changes," she said.	The stories of women who were unknowingly involved in relationships with undercover police officers are revealed as their testimonies to MPs are made public.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics while many clinics provide a good service, some give too little advice and support. It says some fail to make it clear that non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can offer only an estimate of Down's risk and is not diagnostic. One private clinic said counselling was a vital part of the test. NIPT involves taking a blood sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood. This is how doctors can gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions affecting the baby, such as Down's. Doctors can also use NIPT to determine a baby's sex. This isn't something NHS England will be advocating when it rolls out the test to high-risk women next year, but it is already big business for some private clinics in the UK. Most private NIPT providers offer their tests to women through hospitals and healthcare clinics, although some clinics are located in retail chains on High Streets. NIPT is also available on some websites for women to order directly. The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, says the information currently offered to women and couples accessing NIPT outside the NHS can sometimes be poor and incomplete. It says some providers are not telling women enough about the limits of the test. Advertising by clinics can fail to point out that NIPT can vary in its accuracy, and that it may give a reading that turns out to be false. This is important because women use the test result to decide whether to have more risky, invasive diagnostic tests that pose a chance of miscarriage. The report says there have been instances where the NHS was "left to pick up the pieces" after women had been told that they had a high chance of carrying a baby with a genetic disease based on their NIPT result but had not been given sufficient follow-up. One woman who used a private testing service told the Nuffield Council: "My results were delivered via a telephone call on a Friday teatime. I was then told if I needed to know more to phone back on Monday. In the meantime arrangements would be made to facilitate a termination." Dr Louise Bryant, who helped write the Nuffield Council report, said: "We are concerned that some women are not being supported well enough to make informed decisions." Judith Pilling, from the private provider This is my: Health Screening & Ultrasound Centres, said trained genetic counsellors should be accessible for patients when queries or concerns arise - something her company offers. Many groups have welcomed the Nuffield Council report, but some have criticised parts of its content, including a call for a ban on the use of NIPT for determining the sex of an unborn child. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said: "We should be absolutely clear that there is no peer-reviewed evidence of sex-selective abortion taking place in the UK. "Where any woman is under pressure to produce a male child, the ethical answer is not to deny every pregnant woman the right to find out information about her own pregnancy, but to do our utmost to ensure gender equality and access to comprehensive women's support services so that women can make their own choice about their pregnancy free from coercion."	Pregnant women are being urged to ask questions of private providers offering a new test for Down's syndrome.
I remember to this day the feeling of freezing rain blinding me and the extreme cold wind causing my ears to hurt. However, that did not bother me at this time. What was the occasion? Well, this was Hogmanay and the boys of the township were carrying out the traditional ritual of going from house to house on this special evening. What is the tradition behind it? It is widely thought that some of these island traditions came from the Vikings who were settlers in the Western Isles in particular, during past times. To be honest, that did not matter to me. I was out and about having fun. This traditional event, which happened in the Uists throughout the centuries, was also practised in many other places, but with differences in format depending on where you lived. On these nights it was the young males that went round the township with permission given to boys as young as five to go out with the big boys. The upper age limit was normally 17. My township was North Boisdale and I would say there were about 25 houses to visit and a few not so friendly dogs to dodge. The start time was 19:00 and all the boys would meet up at one end of the township and begin to visit each house. Each person had a pillow case or bag that would be filled with goodies received from householders. As you walked between each house the boys would shout in Gaelic "Hogmanay and New Year Hooray". This alerted the folk, especially on a clear calm night, that the Hogmanay boys were on their way. Outside each house one person would recite the Hogmanay poem and at the end of the poem ask the man of the house for permission to enter. Once inside the house a candle would be lit by the eldest boy in the group and then the candle would be passed round all family members starting with the householder. There was superstition involved with this as it was thought that when the candle was being circled above each individual's head, if the candle was to go out it meant that individual would have a year of bad luck. Of course jokers within the family would try and blow the candle out when this was taking place. Once every member of the family had been passed the candle, the mother of the house would bring out the gifts. Loafs of bread, sugar, fruit, biscuits and of course sweets. Sometimes folk would offer meat or fish. The man of the house would give money, as would older males in the family. Older men in the township would offer a dram to the senior boys, which would of course be refused. On leaving each house the oldest boy in the group would wish luck on the family for the coming year. After being to each house the pillowcases would be full and heavy and it was at the last house that the fun began. The pillowcases would be emptied and the goods shared out evenly. It did not matter how old you were - the boys all got their share. The hosting house would also provide a small party that would finish before midnight so all the boys were home before the bells. On the way home the blinding rain or freezing conditions did not bother me as I now had a pillowcase full of goodies, a full belly, and money in my pocket. A great start to the New Year. Dr Ragnhild Ljosland, a lecturer at Centre for Nordic Studies in Orkney, confirms the Hogmanay Boys tradition has connections to Norse culture. She says: "As a child in Norway in the 1980s, I remember dressing up to gÃ¥ julebukk (go Yule-goating). "Julebukk involves putting on a mask and going to people's doors to chase Christmas out around New Year. You sing and carry a sack to collect cakes and sweeties - ah, the joy of ending up with a huge sack of goodies. "If we go a couple of hundred years further back in time, Norwegian people used to walk in a group around the farms in the parish, dressed up so that nobody would recognise them. "These costumes could be rather frightening and represent fantastical animals, such as an effigy of a billygoat's head on a stick. The guisers would be offered food and drink at each farm. "These customs are extremely old, going back to pre-Christian beliefs. "Folk belief had it that supernatural beings were extra active at this time of year. "Interestingly, similar traditions are also found in Iceland, the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. In Shetland today, for example, guisers travel around and are offered food and drink at Up Helly Aa in January."	With Hogmanay looming, DJ MacIntyre, Gaelic officer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, highlights a tradition once popular on South Uist in the Western Isles and with a connection to Norse culture - Hogmanay Boys.
Simon Dredge suffered life-threatening injuries in the crash on Wednesday. He was travelling in the boat along with three other professional crew including his father Peter, a champion powerboat racer. Powerboat company, Vector World said the boat was on its first test run when it overturned just after 08:20 BST. A spokeswoman said: "We are encouraged to hear that Simon is stable and improving." Peter Dredge, Simon Wood-Power, a powerboat racer and Lee Hurst, a powerboat engineer were all taken to Southampton General Hospital with non life-threatening injuries. They have since been discharged. Eyewitnesses described seeing the high-powered vessel come out of the water "like a rocket" before flipping over. In a statement following the crash, Hampshire Constabulary said it appeared the powerboat "lost control" just before it collided with the Hamble Point cardinal mark. The large metal buoy marks the entrance to the Hamble River. A joint investigation into the crash is being carried out by Hampshire Police Marine Unit and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.	A teenager is "stable and improving" in hospital after the prototype powerboat he was training in crashed and overturned in the Solent.
It emerged that the wife of former Ulster Unionist MLA Neil Somerville has a wood pellet boiler under the scheme in a family business. The boiler is used to power a horse solarium. "My wife runs the business which also includes the grooming and clipping of horses, but due to the type of work she does, it wasn't possible to carry it out all year round," Mr Somerville explained. "The installation of the wood pellet boiler has meant that my wife is now able to carry out her work on a year-round basis and a horse solarium has been installed. We are happy for an inspection to take place." But perhaps the question many people asked - as images of goggle-wearing dobbins tanning themselves leapt into their minds - is just what exactly is a horse solarium? David Kirkpatrick, of the Equine Council for Northern Ireland, who has one, said they are the "same as what a physio would use for the human populace". While the solariums can differ, Mr Kirkpatrick's consists of three rows of 500 watt bulbs which the horse stands under. "I would use the solarium for my own horses after work. The whole purpose of it is that the heat gets into the muscles," he said. "You put your horse in for probably half an hour a day maximum, or maybe half an hour twice a day, it's not a continual process, at least I've never heard of anyone using it on a continual basis. "You can also use weaker solariums in stud farms to falsify the length of the day - you're encouraging your mare to come into season, to think it's spring." He added: "They are becoming more and more common equestrian wise. Ten years ago they were unheard of. But it is something that is becoming more and more common and more equestrian people are starting to use them." The horses seem unfazed and no goggles are required. "My fella just stands and eats hay, he just goes to sleep underneath it," Mr Kirkpatrick said. "The only welfare issue is to make sure that if he throws his head up, he doesn't smash a bulb." Fiona Parker, who works for a West Midlands-based company which sells horse solariums to both Northern Ireland and the Republic, said they have two main uses. "Number one, if you wash a horse, it can dry them and it keeps them nice and warm," she said. "The other thing that people use them for, is that when you ride a horse you have to spend so much time warming it up - like you would, you wouldn't go straight out there and sprint you would do a few warm-up exercises to loosen up the muscles. "So if you've got a competition yard and you've got a lot of horses to ride, what a lot of people do is put them under the solarium and it just warms their muscles slightly. "It's just a preventative thing to prevent injury." So as the RHI scandal continues to burn, if someone asks you what's the most surprising use for one of the scheme's boilers, you can reply "there's neigh contest".	While the the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme has lurched from controversy to controversy, one of the more unusual uses for an RHI wood pellet boiler came to light on Monday.
Williams driver Felipe Massa suffered two left-rear wheel failures and Renault's Kevin Magnussen a suspected broken left rear suspension. The session was stopped for 30 minutes as officials launched an investigation and cleared the track of debris. Williams had a wheel problem. Renault's turned out to be a suspension failure. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas said the team had found a problem with the "rim clearance" - the distance between the wheel and the wheel assembly - and that he had had the same problem as Massa but had been "more lucky". "If there is something under the rim too close, that can cause problems," the Finn said. Both Massa's failures happened on his first lap out of the pits on the entry to the Turn Six hairpin. On the first, Massa was pitched into a spin. On the second, he did not lose control, but the tyre appeared to simply pop off the rim. There were no clear television pictures of the failure on Magnussen's car. Williams did not send either of its cars out again when the session was re-started with eight minutes remaining. Magnussen, who had broken rear suspension, was also consigned to the pits. In a busy final few minutes of running, Rosberg supplanted early pace-setter Hamilton at the top of the times with a lap of one minute 38.037 seconds. The world champion was 0.146secs behind in the second Mercedes. Rosberg returned to the pits at the end of the session in "limp-home mode", his engineer telling him over the radio that he thought there was "an engine issue". Mercedes later diagnosed it as an ignition problem and said they hoped it would be solved for second practice. Hamilton already knows that he has a five-place grid drop from wherever he qualifies because of a gearbox change after the team discovered a potential problem and decided not to risk a retirement. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third quickest, 0.628secs off the pace and 0.396secs quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in fourth. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fifth, ahead of Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz and the McLaren of Jenson Button. Fernando Alonso returned to the McLaren after being forced to miss the last race in Bahrain because of a broken rib sustained in his high-speed crash at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The Spaniard faces further medical checks after the first session to establish whether he will be allowed to continue for the rest of the weekend but he made no public reports of any physical discomfort. Alonso was 12th fastest, 0.564secs slower than Button.

Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a "manoeuvre". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. "We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership," he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. "Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling." A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of "irregularities" in the text.	Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen have freed a senior presidential aide who they abducted 10 days ago.
But many people will be asking this weekend if the 28-year-old is really worth all that money? To answer that you need to separate his value to United right now from how some might view his broader value in the transfer market. For all the income they generate, United are a club going through a difficult transition. They are way off the pace in the Premier League and struggling to qualify for the Champions League next season. The financial impact of failure this season will not dent the money making machine that is Old Trafford, but long term decline? That's a very different proposition. All of this has placed huge pressure on the club's new manager David Moyes and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward to show the club is still a force to be reckoned with despite the retirement of the formidable Sir Alex Ferguson. The record signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea in the January transfer window was the first part of what Woodward and Moyes hope will be a three-step strategy back to the top. Rooney's new deal is part two while the summer is phase three. That's when we will really be able to judge how serious the club's American owners, the Glazer family, are about rebuilding United's under-powered squad. Mata's arrival and Rooney's decision to stay - having been courted first by Manchester City and more recently Chelsea - will surely help the club attract top talent before the start of next season. The other thing to consider is that Rooney had just 18 months remaining on his previous deal. United knew they faced the possibility of him leaving for nothing. By signing him up for five and-a-half years, they have protected the value of arguably their most valuable and recognisable playing asset. So while the £85m agreement up to 2019 looks exorbitant, it's probably cheaper than United having to find a replacement in the transfer market and pay his wages. The total cost would have probably been much higher. It leaves United free to spend their money elsewhere - with midfield and defence arguably a greater priority. The deal Rooney has signed is, I am told, worth around £250,000 a week in basic salary. What makes the new contract potentially much more lucrative to the England striker is an agreement with the club to market and exploit his individual commercial rights around the world. This obviously has benefits for both the club and the player but there is no doubting United's hugely successful commercial operation could help take Rooney to a new financial level and certainly on a par with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. In playing terms it would be hard to argue Rooney is in the same league as those two. But as things stand he is United's most marketable brand and that is ultimately why the club couldn't afford to let him go.	With projected revenues of £420m this year, there is no question Manchester United can afford to make Wayne Rooney the best paid player in the Premier League.
Born at Alltnacaillich, Strathmore in 1714, Rob Donn could not read or write and dictated his poetry from memory in later life. A wall hanging depicting scenes from his life and work is to be created in a project led by Strathnaver Museum and Mackay Country Community Trust. People living in and around Strathnaver are to be invited to help make the piece of craftwork. Donn's poetry continues to be celebrated and studied today. Some of his work has turned into music and performed at Glasgow's Celtic Connections Festival. Strathnaver Museum has been awarded Â£5,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund's Stories, Stones and Bones programme towards the project.	A Gaelic bard is to be remembered in needlework.
The Ayrton Light, located above the Great Bell - known as Big Ben - needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it. Installed in 1885, it was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021 because of repairs to the tower. The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark. It is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for. Big Ben will not be heard from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after "concerns". Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said "it can't be right" that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday.	A lamp at the top of Elizabeth Tower - which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting - is to stop shining for the first time in more than 70 years.
John Stevenson Wright was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to 18 months for sexually abusing Darren Kenny. The court heard the offences took place when Wright worked at a pub run by Mr Kenny's parents in Rochdale. Wright, 68, abused Mr Kenny as a teenager when he used to sleep over at the pub. He was convicted of gross indecency, indecent assault and inciting a child under 16 to engage in a sexual act between 1978 and 1981. Wright's sentence will be added to the 22 years he is already serving for sexually abusing boys. Mr Kenny, 50, an officer with Greater Manchester Police in Tameside, was repeatedly abused as a teenager and thought Wright was dead until he typed his name into an internet search engine. While looking for his abuser's obituary, he was "horrified" to learn Wright had been jailed for child sexual abuse in Rochdale. He added: "We had been told he had died - I had my closure and then when we found out he wasn't dead I had no closure any more and I needed it back." Mr Kenny, who has waived his right to anonymity, contacted the officer who had investigated Wright and said: "I've got another victim - me. "Even if wasn't a policeman I would have come forward. "The length of sentence isn't important... returning the guilty verdict is what is important." Mr Kenny encouraged other abuse victims to speak out. "Look at me - I'm here, I'm a 50-year-old cop, and if I can do it I'm sure they can."	A police officer who thought his childhood abuser had died before he chanced across him online has said the man's conviction brought him "closure".
It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin "enemies of the people" and called for such "traitors" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West. Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a "half-witted rabble", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their "mass psychosis". "I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double," he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled "foot soldier" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a "true patriot". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the "shame of Russia". "Why don't you get lost?" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let "normal, honest people" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his "hasty" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his "discourtesy", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his "emotional outburst". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan "for existing". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were "itching" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. "Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him," wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. "Just imagine what would happenâ€¦ If it weren't forâ€¦ Democracy." There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. "It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening," argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. "The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society," wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. "The situation is very tense now," Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. "Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads," he warned.  "So we need to be careful."	Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.
Wasps goalkeeper Neil Parry had already denied Dobbie three times before the striker curled in a drive off a post. Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the 33-year-old would not be denied his fifth goal in three Challenge Cup outings and 12th goal of the season for the Championship side. His close-range header killed off the lively League One visitors' hopes. And it ended a run of eight games without a victory for the Dumfries side - a sequence that had ended with Gavin Skelton standing down as manager earlier this week. The side under caretaker Jim Thomson, who had been football development manager, for the first time became the second into the last four. Dundee United had earlier beaten Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 at East End Park. League One leaders Livingston host Welsh champions The New Saints, while Ayr United visit Championship rivals St Mirren, in two Sunday quarter-finals. A Grant Anderson header had grazed the Alloa crossbar before Dobbie made the breakthrough at Palmerston Park. The Wasps had their moments, with Jamie Longworth being denied by goalkeeper Lee Robinson and Greig Spence going close with an overhead kick with Jim Goodwin's part-time side only one goal behind and looking the more likely to score. However, after Parry prevented Derek Lyle extending the lead, Dobbie provided the finish from Dean Brotherston's cross 14 minutes from time. Queen of the South caretaker manager Jim Thomson: "It was a shock to myself. On the Monday, Gavin just decides to resign. I think it was a combination of things. "It has been a terrible run and hopefully that brings a bit of confidence to the squad. "It has been a hard week for everybody, but the way the boys trained during the week, the tempo they took into the game. "I thought in the first half we were excellent. Some of their play was brilliant. "It is a break from the league for the boys and it's a national cup semi-final so you always want to progress." Alloa Athletic manager Jim Goodwin: "We came here to be positive and to take the game to Queen of the South. I thought we done that for large spells of the game. "They're very lucky to have Stephen Dobie, who's a top player. "He's the type of player who could easily be playing in the Premiership. "I'm proud of the players. We didn't just come down here and look to hang on. Overall, there's a lot to be positive about."	Stephen Dobbie's double took Queen of the South into the Challenge Cup semi-finals at Alloa Athletic's expense.
The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their captain and colour sergeant.  It took place in February while on exercise in Kenya. Fifteen were sentenced to detention, one of whom was dismissed from the Army. A 16th was also dismissed. All the soldiers pleaded guilty to disobeying a lawful command - an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. The soldiers complained of being "led by muppets", the court martial heard. The prosecutor at the court martial said members of the platoon had been seething at the way they were being managed, and felt that they were "not appreciated". The court heard a captain and sergeant apparently got drunk before a lengthy training march in the Brecon Beacons last winter. The troops were said to have been furious at finding their two commanders asleep, rather than greeting the soldiers as they crossed the finish line. Tensions came to a head at the end of a training exercise in Kenya in February, when 16 soldiers decided to protest. Ahead of a parade, a ringleader shouted "sit down" and members of the platoon did so. The commanders ordered each man in turn to stand up, but were ignored. Corporal Anthony Brown, said to be the ringleader, was stripped of his rank, dismissed from the Army and sentenced to 60 days' detention. Two lance corporals were reduced to privates and sentenced to 60 days' detention, while a third was reduced to private and dismissed without detention. Twelve privates were sentenced to 40 days' detention. The soldiers were in the 1st Battalion at the time of the protest. However, the 1st has now become the 2nd, following Army restructuring. John Wilson, a retired colonel and former editor of the British Army Review who lectures in military history, described the nature of the soldiers' protest as "unprecedented". The sentences given to the troops at the court martial were "strong enough to make the point", added Col Wilson. "I don't think a corporal, whatever his grievances, can expect to orchestrate such a public protest in front of the entire battle group parade and get away with it." An Army spokesman said it was "not appropriate" to comment on the sentencing.	Fifteen soldiers have been jailed after a court martial for staging a "sit-in" in protest at being "led by muppets".
Security consultant Paul Moore examined the publicly available information of the UK's six biggest ISPs. He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers. But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues. The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed. More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen. Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes. "There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious," he told the BBC. The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites. Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them. "Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly," said Mr Moore. "On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it." But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him. TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had "integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work". "We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system," it added. Sky told the BBC: "We take our customers' security very seriously. We constantly review our systems and we have robust, independently assessed protocols in place to make sure customer information is as secure as possible." Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey University, said he was shocked by the findings. "TalkTalk still has problems and others have not dissimilar ones," he said. "I find it very surprising that after the TalkTalk hack, they [the six ISPs] still appear not to be attending to the basics. He added: "ISPs are the single biggest handlers of our personal data and I would expect them to get this right."	The security of the UK's biggest internet service providers needs "major improvement", according to one expert.
The former army officer promised to be "even more dangerous than when I was in uniform". He also vowed to turn his tiny West African nation into an "economic superpower" over the next five years. President Jammeh first seized power in 1994 but was re-elected in December in a widely criticised poll. "You cannot be in your offices every day doing nothing... and at the end of the day you expect to be paid," he said on a televised address on Wednesday. "This has to stop. You either do your work or leave or go to jail," the president said. "I will wipe out almost 82% of those in the workforce in the next five years starting this Friday unless they change their attitudes," he said - without elaborating. Mr Jammeh also promised "zero tolerance" on corruption and drugs. The Gambia - a popular destination for foreign tourists - has recently become a key transit point for cocaine trafficked from Latin America. The president also promised to focus more on the empowerment of women and create more jobs for the youth. Mr Jammeh - who first came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994 - has been criticised by international rights groups for suppressing any dissent. On Tuesday, former Information Minister Amadou Scatred Janneh, a US citizen, was sentenced to life in jail for plotting a coup and distributing T-shirts with the slogan "End to Dictatorship Now".	Yahya Jammeh has been sworn in for a fourth term as Gambia's president and promised to "wipe out 82%" of workers, accusing them of being lazy.
Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49. They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches. Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1. England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett. But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history. Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country. Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss. Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards. Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point. Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession. Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series. Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings. Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots. Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions. Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour. England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches. Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day. Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit. Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so. Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning. At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before. Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable. Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones. I feel privileged to be here to have seen it.	Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka.
Convicted murderer Sweat, 35, was shot twice and captured less than two miles (3km) from the Canadian border. His prison-break partner Richard Matt, 49, was killed by police on Friday. The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of Constable on Sunday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference. He said Sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away. "The nightmare is finally over," the governor said. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote on its Twitter page: "#DavidSweat of the #PrisonBreakNY captured. Sleep peacefully New York." The Buffalo News website earlier quoted a source who said that the convict's wound were "life-threatening" and he was bleeding badly. Matt was shot dead near the town of Malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate New York, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. US officials have charged prison worker Joyce Mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms Mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts. Officials allege that he gave Sweat and Matt the frozen hamburger meat Ms Mitchell had used to hide hacksaw blades and a screwdriver. Mr Palmer's attorney said his client had no knowledge that the meat contained the escape tools. Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy. Manhunt timeline	Second New York State prison escapee David Sweat is in custody after being shot by police, US officials report.
"I'm a progressive who gets results and I will be a progressive president who gets results," she said. The two Democratic contenders took questions from an audience in New Hampshire, which will pick its presidential nominees in a few days. Iowa kicked off the state-by-state election earlier this week. The former secretary of state, Mrs Clinton, was declared the winner in Iowa by a whisker after a prolonged count. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator with a big lead in New Hampshire polls, listed issues upon which he thinks Mrs Clinton was not liberal enough - trade agreements, Wall Street regulation, climate change and her backing for the war in Iraq. "I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15m from Wall Street," said Mr Sanders. Mrs Clinton, who followed him on to the stage in Manchester, said she was not bothered by his accusation but it was not helpful because they shared the same aspirations. Under the senator's definition, President Barack Obama would not be a progressive, she said. The former first lady was also on the defensive for her speaking fees paid by big businesses, which amount to $9m, according to the Associated Press news agency. When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper why she was paid $675,000 for one event, she said: "I don't know. That is what they offered." The tone is definitely rising between the two Democratic opponents. All day, by e-mail, on Twitter, they sparred about who is the real progressive. On Tuesday, Mr Sanders had said that his opponent was a progressive ''on some days''. Mrs Clinton called it a low blow. And they went at it again in the evening, during the town hall. This isn't just about semantics: it's about who has the ability not only to build on President Obama's legacy, but to take it much further and, by doing so, inspire voters frustrated by the slow pace of change. Mr Sanders is promising a revolution and dismissing those who say that's pie in the sky. Change always happens bottom up, he said, during the town hall. Mrs Clinton, who comes across mostly as a pragmatic doer, hasn't yet managed to capture the imagination of young voters and she admitted she had work to do on that front. This was a format that brought out the best in both candidates - they took turns on stage, and interacted with voters who asked very considered questions. The candidates gave thoughtful answers. This was probably one of Mr Sanders' best performances so far - he did less shouting and arm-waving than usual. Prodded by questions about faith and humility, Mrs Clinton opened up in a way she usually reserves for small settings, not national television, but which always works well with voters. Earlier on Wednesday, in response to the same accusation about not being a progressive, Mrs Clinton listed her accomplishments in helping minorities and the disadvantaged. She mentioned her efforts in expanding access to children's health insurance and her push to support women's rights and gay rights. The tensions between the two come as they prepare to debate each other on stage together on Thursday night, five days before the New Hampshire primary vote. Both Republican and Democratic parties will formally name their presidential candidates at conventions in July. Americans will finally go to the polls to choose the new occupant of the White House in November.	Hillary Clinton has defended her progressive record after Democratic rival Bernie Sanders mounted an attack on her links to Wall Street.
Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan were bowled out for 234 after Alastair Cook (76 not out) and Joe Root (71 not out) helped England declare on 173-1 to set a target of 565. James Anderson and Chris Woakes took 3-41 and Moeen Ali 3-88 as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 89 runs to lose on the fourth day. Victory was England's second-biggest against Pakistan in terms of runs. However, all-rounder Ben Stokes will have a scan on Tuesday after injuring a calf while bowling in the afternoon session. Pakistan's highest stand was the 58 Mohammad Hafeez and Younus Khan put on for the third wicket, but both fell to Moeen in the space of six overs. Mohammad Amir was last man out, removed by Woakes for 29. The third Test at Edgbaston begins on 3 August. England, who opted against enforcing the follow-on on Sunday, added 75 runs in nine overs in the morning after resuming on 98-1. Root hit 10 fours in his 48-ball 71 to go with his first-innings 254, while Cook - 49 overnight - brought up his fastest Test half-century, off 55 deliveries. Anderson, on his home ground, made early inroads as he had Shan Masood caught in the slips for the second time in the match before trapping Azhar Ali lbw, but Hafeez and Younus resisted for 15.1 overs. With Stokes, who was injured during his follow-through, off the field, Moeen struck twice. He had Hafeez caught at short leg for 42 and Younus at long-on for 28. Woakes then bowled Misbah-ul-Haq for 35, the skipper having put on 43 with Asad Shafiq. After Sarfraz Ahmed became Woakes' second victim, Anderson and Moeen completed their three-wicket hauls by trapping Shafiq and Yasir Shah lbw respectively. Part-time spinner Root then took a wicket with just his second ball, having Wahab Riaz caught at short fine leg. Amir struck five fours in his 43-ball resistance, but Woakes finished things off by having him caught at mid-off when trying to drive. Man of the match Joe Root on Test Match Special: "It's a great feeling. It's about contributing to wins. It's the most controlled I've played. "The bowlers grafted really hard today and last night. It was a really good effort from all of the team. It sets it up nicely for the series." England captain Alastair Cook: "I was surprised the decision not to follow-on caused such a stir. To me it was a bit of a no-brainer. I think everyone else wanted a day off." Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "It's an absolute hammering. It's been very similar to the Sri Lanka series, where England dominated with this kind of performance." Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq: "We have to improve in every department. We could not build pressure and let them score a massive total in the first innings. "If we had restricted them to 350, we had a chance. But it was difficult to come back from 600."	England thrashed Pakistan by 330 runs in the second Test at Old Trafford to level the four-match series at 1-1.
For 70 years, my father has lived with the shame of what happened to his ship, HMS Hebe, in June 1940. During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel. The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. "It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment. "The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us. "There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep." In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. "As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest". "It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army." The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation. My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a "lack of moral fibre". "We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others. "Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital. "About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches." The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain. "We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return." To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo. "This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day," he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.	BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles has been talking to his father, Harold, about his recollections of the Dunkirk evacuation.
Soon he won't need a book to learn more about this tiny British overseas territory in the Mediterranean, just south of Spain. Following the lead of the UK town of Monmouth, Gibraltar is aiming to spill the content of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia into the real world. To do this, it is equipping Gibraltar's tourist attractions with QR codes - "quick response" barcodes that can be scanned with a mobile phone. These black-and-white pixelated images have been around for more than two decades but have started to gain mainstream acceptance only in the past few years, appearing on everything from walls and billboards to newspapers and detergent packs. As well as other technologies such as near-field communication tags (NFC) and augmented reality (AR) apps, they give mobile phone users information about a particular object. QR codes store text, phone numbers, email addresses and calendar events, and once scanned, create links to websites or generate some interactive content on your smartphone's screen. Tourism is a big part of Gibraltar's economy, with more than 11 million visitors spending Â£280m last year, and the authorities are keen to seize any opportunity to increase revenue. The QR codes take users directly to a Wikipedia page of the relevant tourist attraction, says Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum. "Gibraltar is a multi-layered cake of historical events, starting with the Neanderthals of 50,000 years ago through to modern humans," he says. What are QR codes' chances? QR codes have been around for years, but only 11% of UK smartphone users scanned one in July 2012, according to data agency Comscore. Some analysts have been saying that other technologies such as NFC, which lets you get information wirelessly just by waving your phone in front of the chip, may eventually replace QR. But QR supporters argue that NFC is not quite there yet - it is expensive to create tags, and for now, not many phones can scan them. QR codes are free to create, cheap to install and nearly all modern smartphones have apps that can read them. Augmented reality apps are also a potential threat - they allow information to appear on your handset's screen simply by pointing the phone towards an object of interest. Google Glass headset could even take this one step further, and make information appear right in front of the user's eyes. But QR is far from being dead - and recent moves by the electronic giants Apple and Microsoft could give it a push. The technology will be integrated into Apple's Passbook ticket/coupon wallet service, available on the forthcoming iOS6 operating system. It will allow users to get into a cinema, check in for a flight, or redeem a coupon via their phone. Microsoft has recently signed a licensing agreement with NeoMedia, one of the pioneers in the mobile barcodes field, to acquire all of the firm's QR code patents. "Our own caving unit has now catalogued over 200 caves in Rock, with many being rich in archaeology but inaccessible to most people. "Here we have another way of getting all this information across to the world." "Gibraltarpedia" organisers want their QR codes to communicate with the user's phone to determine its set-up language, so a Brazilian tourist can be taken to a page in Portuguese, a Turk to one in Turkish and so on, says Roger Bamkin, a consultant to the Gibraltar government and a volunteer from Wikimedia UK, the charity that supports the online encyclopaedia. "By scanning QR codes around them, tourists will be to able to find out about the place they are visiting in their own language, with the description written by a volunteer speaking that language," he says. Volunteers have been producing up to 20 articles a day in various languages, and Mr Bamkin has been in Gibraltar this week seeking more people to contribute photos, maps and information on the territory's history. But once all the landmarks are equipped with codes and all the articles are written, other factors need to be dealt with for the project to take off. Roaming charges may deter visitors from connecting to the web - and the government of Gibraltar says it is considering the possibility of free wi-fi. Also, tourists should be familiar with QR codes and be willing to use them. Although people may be used to seeing them, not many in the Western world actually scan them. On the other hand, in Japan and South Korea many use them on a daily basis. Tesco Korea lets consumers shop in a virtual supermarket while standing on a subway platform. They scan images of groceries with a QR code reader and buy them with a click. But Gibraltarpedia organisers say that they realise QR codes may be replaced by other technology - just as DVDs replaced CDs, says Mr Bamkin. However, he believes that the project will be a success - and be it QR, NFC or any other future tech, Wikipedia is aiming to bridge online and offline worlds. "Projects like Gibraltarpedia are a test of our mission," says Mr Bamkin, adding that the next target is expansion into northern Africa. "Africans have a great need of free information - there are many more Wikipedia articles in the UK or France than there are in Morocco, Algeria, or Mali."	Driving along a sunlit road along Gibraltar's western slopes, a tourist stops by one of the city's top attractions - St Michael's Cave - and consults his travel guide.

The man dialled two taxi firms from the landline in the house at Wodecroft Road, Luton, but hung up after he was asked for his phone number. Bedfordshire Police asked anyone who recognised the man's voice to contact them. A flat-screen television and other electrical items were stolen from the house. The calls were made in the early hours of Saturday 25 October using a cordless telephone, which was then left on a table in the garden, police said. The man called two Luton taxi firms which were both dealt with by the same control office. In the first call, the suspect was asked to leave his landline number, but said he did not know it. He was then asked to leave his mobile number and he started to, but then stopped, claiming he did not know it. Police said he then made a second call and got through to the same controller, who explained the office handled calls for more than one taxi firm. The force hopes the suspect, who almost revealed his mobile phone number, can be identified from the recordings, which were made automatically. Det Con Scott Hannam said: "We are keen to identify the man as we believe he may have important information which could assist our investigation. "I would urge anyone who recognises his voice, or for the man himself, to contact police. "I am also keen to hear from anyone who has any information or saw a large television being carried around this area on the night in question."	Police have released recordings of a suspected burglar phoning for a taxi from the house he had just broken into.
Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order. When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case. It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education. Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled. According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014. Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential. Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels. Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction. "I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him," she says. "I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick." Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him. "Freedom is what makes learning still fun," he says. "In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker." Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children. Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum. "A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime." Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children. "I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life." These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education. They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong. But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do. Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis. It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information. The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy. But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos. In a statement, Kensington and Chelsea Council acknowledged the right of parents to educate their children at home. But it said "when this happens we believe that we have a duty of care to establish that the child is receiving a suitable education".	A London council has withdrawn an order forcing a mother to send her home educated child to school.
He said he wanted to act "in the best interests" of the university where he studied as an undergraduate. The resignation comes after several of his Bill Cosby shows have been axed in the US. The 77-year-old entertainer has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women. The comedian has not directly addressed the accusations, but his lawyers have described them as "discredited" and "defamatory." Mr Cosby said in a statement on Monday that he had "always been proud" of his association with Temple University, where he had been a trustee for over 30 years. "The Board of Trustees accepts Dr Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university,'' the university said in a statement. More than a dozen women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, have come forward claiming that Mr Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them. Some of the accusations date back to 2005 and 2006. A woman from Florida has also accused Mr Cosby of raping her backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976. Mr Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Several broadcasters have decided not to continue projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix.	US comedian Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia amid ongoing allegations of sexual assault.
This weekend's match is the centenary of the first meeting between the two sides, and with Leicester arriving as champions there is no doubt which club is in the ascendancy at the moment. During Guscott's time at The Rec it was the West country club that ruled the roost - and he believes they are potentially on the cusp of a revival. This game is big in a lot of different ways for different generations of families and supporters, and the players that have represented both clubs through the years. Those that have followed and played for these two clubs over many years will remember the times they have been successful and the times they have not. Bath took over from Tigers as the dominant English club around 1983-84 and maintained that until the early-to-mid 1990s. Since that time Tigers have been there or thereabouts, often battling for supremacy with Wasps and have been the most consistent English club for 25 years or so. This particular fixtures is given an extra edge because of the anniversary. It evokes memories of all the great games of the past but, looking to the future, Bath are potential challengers to a Tigers team that will want to put down a marker. Throughout my career, games against Leicester - as well as local rivals Gloucester and Bristol - were the biggest games that Bath played in, perhaps because of three cup finals Bath won in 1989, 1994 and 1996. At the time, both teams were used to winning and were full of current or previous internationals players. Who wouldn't want to be involved in those games? The contests were always full of tension, particularly the 1996 final when we got a penalty try to win 16-15. At the end of the game Leicester's Neil back mistook team-mate Steve Lander for Bath's Andy Robinson and pushed him over. With a comfortable win at Newcastle on the opening weekend, Bath have got off to a good start. However, the visit of Leicester is one of the biggest tests of the season and it is good that it arrives early. The Tigers challenge will show this relatively new Bath team where they are and how much further they need to go. Fly-half George Ford ran the game well against the Falcons last week in poor conditions, he was tactically good and nailed most of his kicks. The Tigers know him well and I'm sure the likes of Julian Salvi and Jordan Crane would like the opportunity to get some tackling practice in on their former team-mate. Individually, Bath have exciting backs like Kyle Eastmond, Jonathan Joseph, Nick Abendanon, Tom Heathcote, Anthony Watson, Tom Biggs, Semesa Rokoduguni, Gavin Henson and more. We await to see what they can collectively produce, especially as there are high expectations to deal with. You have to admire the Tigers - the club, supporters, playing squad and management. Friday Harlequins v Northampton - Quins win Sale v Newcastle  - Sale win Saturday Exeter v London Wasps - Exeter win Worcester v London Irish - Warriors win Bath v Leicester - Bath win Sunday Saracens v Gloucester - Sarries win This weekend's full fixture list Over the years they have been brilliant at maintaining their values by recruiting the right players. By that, I mean they have signed players that aren't always the best in their position but are seen as the right fit for the Tigers culture. That's very important. The Tigers expects nothing less than 100% commitment on and off the field and expect their players to abide by the culture and code of conduct set out. You may think that's the case at every club. It's not - and that is one of the reasons that the others have struggled to match Leicester. Leicester ran over Worcester last week and they will look to power through Bath with more aggression and precision at the breakdown. They will look to make Bath players ask themselves whether they have what it takes to be a top-four team. Have they got the heart and soul for the fight? Fly-half Ryan Lamb had a mixed game last weekend but that's what you get from a player who tends to play what he sees rather than what might have been planned. He does the unexpected, which is different to Toby Flood. Flanker Tom Croft, who is out for the season with a knee injury, is a huge loss and we all wish him a speedy recovery. Bath want to change from last season's defensive displays and test themselves with a more balanced style. This new game plan will be given a severe test against the Tigers. Outside the clear colossal forward engagement that will take place, Bath's most important player will be Ford. If he has the clear mind to make the right decisions and produce a big-game performance, Bath will win. Media playback is not supported on this device Bath have been starved of success for some time now, but they have begun a journey under new owner Bruce Craig, who has arrived with ideas that are ambitious, but certainly not impossible. Before Craig arrived, Bath had, in my opinion, lost their on-field identity, with no recognisable style. Only under Steve Meehan did they give the impression that something was building, but that ended and another unsuccessful period started. For quite some time Bath haven't had enough quality players or guys who have wanted to work hard enough to earn success. Gary Gold, Mike Ford and their team of coaches have to create that environment. Off the pitch you can see the changes, the club's administration and training facilities all under the same roof at Farleigh Manor, providing a great working habitat. It's hoped the Recreation Ground could house a new stadium for 2015. Maybe Bath will have a winning team by then.	Jeremy Guscott fought many battles with Leicester during his years in the centres for Bath, so he knows just how strong the rivalry is between the two clubs.
Syd's Garden will be "laced with little clues" about the singer, according to Stephen Pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of Pink Floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here The garden has been designed by sculptor Mr Pyle and Paul Herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, Art Garden Health, creates and maintains green spaces for NHS hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr Pyle knew Barrett as a young man when the two began Saturday art classes at Cambridge's Homerton College. They were also members of band Those Without, which toured Cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the Cambridge School of Art before Barrett left for London - and Mr Pyle began a career in theatre set design. "Syd's sister said he liked roses," said Mr Pyle. "And there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. "The artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and Paul worked with those colours. "There's also a nod to Abbey Road's crossing." The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage Barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. "This was the Syd I knew at art school," said Mr Pyle. "The 18-year-old, the free wheeler. "He wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented." He described Barrett as a "celebrated son of Cambridge", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In October 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the Cambridge Corn Exchange in October 2016, where he played his last live gig. A blue plaque was also dedicated to him in Cambridge as part of BBC Music Day 2017.	A childhood friend of Pink Floyd legend Syd Barrett is developing a hospital garden in his honour.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Great City Games, an open and free event for the public, is due to take place in Manchester on Friday. Organisers said the event will go ahead as planned, but a decision on Sunday's Great Manchester Run "is expected in the next 24 hours". The FA Cup final, EFL play-offs and the PGA Championship are also this week. An eight-year-old girl was among those killed in Monday's suicide bombing at Manchester Arena, at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK terror threat level has been raised to its highest level of "critical", meaning further attacks may be imminent. Manchester United cancelled a news conference on Tuesday, due to be held prior to their Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday, and will wear black armbands for the match. The club said: "Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this terribly difficult time." United's players held a minute's silence at training on Tuesday, and the club closed its megastore, museum, cafe and stadium tours to the public. A staff event scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Manager Jose Mourinho said: "We are all very sad about the tragic events; we cannot take out of our minds and our hearts the victims and their families. "We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. "I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one." Ajax manager Peter Bosz said: "What happened yesterday evening in Manchester is something we all feel in Ajax and on behalf of all of us at Ajax we express our sympathies with the victims that fell. The feeling that prevails is the final does not have the glow it should have. "Tomorrow evening should be a football feast but because of the events in Manchester we are affected. It is horrible. My sympathies are heartfelt." Football's European governing body Uefa announced a minute's silence will be observed prior to the final. The opening ceremony will also be considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. Aleksander Ceferin, president of Uefa, said he was "deeply saddened" and shocked that "so many innocent people lost their lives". A Uefa statement said there was "currently no specific intelligence" to suggest Wednesday's game could be a target for further attacks. "Uefa has been closely working with local authorities and the Swedish FA for many months and the terrorist risk had been taken into account since the very beginning of the project," it said. "Furthermore, a number of additional security measures were implemented following the attacks in Stockholm last April." There will be a minute's silence observed at Headingley cricket ground before England's one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday. Both sets of players will also wear black armbands during the game. The South Africa team have been told there will be extra police officers on duty at the ground and increased security at team hotels and practice. There will also be a minute's silence before Saturday's Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park. The Scottish FA's security and integrity officer, Peter McLaughlin, said: "We remain vigilant to the threat posed by global terrorism and are engaged in constant dialogue with colleagues at Police Scotland and the National Counter-Terrorism Security Office. "This ongoing communication and intelligence-sharing is part of our operations protocol for all events at the national stadium, including the forthcoming Scottish Cup final." A number of leading athletes are scheduled to participate at the Great City Games on Friday, while a public half marathon and 10km run are due to be staged in Manchester on Sunday. Wembley hosts Saturday's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea, and the League Two and Championship play-off finals on Sunday and Monday respectively. A Football Association spokesperson said: "Fan safety is of paramount importance and we have robust security measures in place at Wembley Stadium. "In collaboration with the Metropolitan Police and the local authorities there will be an enhanced security operation for all upcoming events. "All supporters are encouraged to arrive for events at Wembley Stadium as early as possible for security checks and to avoid any delays in entering the stadium." The English Football League (EFL) added it "takes security issues extremely seriously" and urged supporters travelling to Wembley to "be vigilant of their surroundings at all times, stay alert and not be alarmed". The Metropolitan Police says extra armed officers will be deployed at this weekend's major sports events in London, with a full review of the security and policing operations under way. "Over the coming days as you go to a music venue, go shopping, travel to work or head off to the fantastic sporting events you will see more officers - including armed officers," said commander Jane Connors. Golf's BMW PGA Championship starts at Wentworth on Thursday. "As with any major event, security is the highest priority," said European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley. "It was before Monday night and it remains so. "We're in constant dialogue with the police and security services. We are comfortable we will react in the right way if in fact we need to significantly increase our security." Cricket's Champions Trophy will take place from 1-18 June at venues in Birmingham, London and Cardiff. A statement from the International Cricket Council [ICC] read: "The ICC and ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] place safety and security at the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Women's World Cup this summer as the highest priority. "We operate on advice from our tournament security directorate - in conjunction with the ECB and relevant authorities - to ensure that we have a robust safety and security plan for both tournaments. "We will continue to work with authorities over the coming hours and days and review our security in line with the threat levels." England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said his team had met their security advisers on Tuesday morning before Wednesday's match against South Africa. "On behalf of the England cricket team, I'd like to offer our thoughts and prayers to everybody in Manchester affected by the tragic events," said Morgan. "I'd also like to give our support to those in and around things and those most affected and those who helped out and continue to help out." The domestic rugby union finishes this weekend, but the National Counter Terrorism security office has been in touch with Sale Sharks and every other Aviva Premiership club asking for details of any events planned by them over the next couple of weeks. There will also be tighter security at horse racing's Epsom Derby on 3 June, with Surrey Police announcing firearms officers on patrol around the grounds. Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: "The Epsom Derby is a fantastic event which attracts thousands of people and spectators from around the world and I am confident that this year's festival will be no exception." England Women's cricketer Danielle Wyatt was at the Ariana Grande concert and said: "Thank you for all messages - I'm safe. Was at the concert enjoying myself like many others - thoughts with victims & families." Manchester United and Spain goalkeeper David de Gea tweeted: "Much rage, much pain. My condolences to the victims' family members involved in the atrocious attack to the heart of the city." Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard said the "beautiful city" of Manchester "will stand together in this dark hour", captain Wayne Rooney said he was "devastated" by the news and winger Ashley Young said he was "absolutely shocked". Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand: "My thoughts & prayers are with all the families & friends affected by last night's attack in Manchester." Former Lancashire and England cricketer Andrew Flintoff: "In the toughest of times the people of Manchester showing why this is such a great city, standing together in the face of such evil." Manchester City players - including captain Vincent Kompany, goalkeeper Willy Caballero, forward Leroy Sane and defender Pablo Zabaleta - also tweeted their support for those affected. Lucy Bronze, from City's women's team, said her "thoughts are with those affected" and urged people to "stick together". Olympic and world 100m champion Usain Bolt tweeted: "Thoughts & prayers goes out to people of Manchester and all those who are affected."	Sporting events and venues in England are conducting major security reviews after 22 people were killed in an attack at Manchester Arena.
The Communication Workers Union said the walkout would start on Monday 19 December and include Christmas Eve. It will involve thousands of workers from the Crown Post Offices. The Post Office said despite the walkout it would be "business as usual" with "at least" 97% of its 11,600 branches not involved. Crown Post Offices are the larger branches that are usually located in High Streets. In April 2016, the Post Office announced plans to transfer up to 61 branches into WH Smith stores over the following year. It said the move was part of a 10-year plan to cut costs and save cash, and would act as a way of "safeguarding the future of the network." "Our members want the Post Office management to pause its closure and privatisation programme, hold off on its planned pensions changes, and commit to sitting down with us and with the other key stakeholders of this Great British institution and, together, construct a lasting vision," said CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey. The Post Office said it was "extremely disappointed" by the CWU's action. "Just today, we agreed with the CWU that we would resume talks, which have been ongoing throughout the summer, on Wednesday," added Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's network and sales director.	Post Office workers will stage five days of strikes from Monday in a continuing dispute over jobs, pensions and branch closures, their union says.
Wales wing Hallam Amos scored two fine tries in the second half while Dorian Jones kicked five points for the hosts. But Hamish Watson's touchdown, plus eight points from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and a penalty from Blair Kinghorn, proved enough for the visitors. Edinburgh move to within four points of rivals Glasgow in sixth, though the Warriors have a game in hand. The Dragons had 20-year-old Wales centre Tyler Morgan and fly-half Dorian Jones back from long-term injuries, while Taulupe Faletau returned from Wales duties. Edinburgh scrum-half Hidalgo-Clyne was making his 50th appearance while the visitors also paraded their Scotland front row. On a muddy surface, the first half produced only penalties, with two from Hidalgo-Clyne and one from Kinghorn on target for the visitors, while Jones kicked one for the Dragons. Flanker Watson wasted a golden chance for the Scots after 24 minutes as he went for the line rather than using the men free outside. The Dragons started the second half at a higher tempo and after barely a minute, Amos sprinted through a gap to score with Jones' conversion giving them the lead. But Edinburgh struck back in their next attack as Watson wrestled his way over from a line-out drive and Hidalgo-Clyne put over the angled kick. Amos then produced a superb finish from 30 metres out when given an overlap from man-of-the-match Faletau's pass. But that unconverted score after 53 minutes proved to be the last of the match. Edinburgh kept the Dragons pinned in their own half in the final quarter but Hidalgo-Clyne was off target with two more penalty attempts as they failed to make their pressure pay. It was the Welsh side's ninth losing bonus point of the season, including five in the last six matches. Dragons host Ospreys on Friday in their final game at Rodney Parade this season, before their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester on 9 April, while Edinburgh host Zebre on Friday. Newport Gwent Dragons: Carl Meyer; Ashton Hewitt, Tyler Morgan, Adam Warren, Hallam Amos; Dorian Jones, Sarel Pretorius; Phil Price, Thomas Rhys Thomas (capt), Brok Harris, Cory Hill, Rynard Landman, Lewis Evans, Nic Cudd, Taulupe Faletau.

The paper claims London-based private doctor Mark Bonar prescribed banned performance-enhancing drugs to over 150 British athletes including footballers. Arsenal said they were "extremely disappointed" by the publication of the claims, "which are without foundation". Chelsea said the claims were "false and entirely without foundation" while leaders Leicester also denied them. Bonar himself broke his silence on the matter on Sunday evening, writing on Twitter that the newspaper's claims were "false and very misleading". "I have never had a relationship with any premier football club or player," he added on his unverified account, @ZenGrifter. Read more: Footballers 'doped by London doctor' Chelsea added they have "never used the services of Dr Bonar and have no knowledge or record of any of our players having been treated by him or using his services". Leicester denied the allegations and added: "We are extremely disappointed that The Sunday Times has published unsubstantiated allegations referring to players from clubs including Leicester City when, on its own admission, it has insufficient evidence to support the claims." Championship side Birmingham City said: "The club have not used the services of Mark Bonar and has no knowledge or record of any of our players, past or present, doing so." The Sunday Times says it has secretly filmed Bonar claiming he has prescribed drugs such as EPO, steroids and human growth hormone to elite sports professionals from the UK and abroad over the past six years, including: The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies. Bonar had his professional services agreement with the Omniya Clinic terminated on Friday, after it emerged he does not have a licence to practise medicine in the UK. The Football Association released a statement regarding the claims, saying: "These are very serious allegations. As such, The FA welcomes UK Anti-Doping's decision to immediately launch an independent review into the matters raised by the Sunday Times. "The FA is fully committed to maintaining the integrity of English football and will work with Ukad and other relevant agencies in seeking to do so. The FA urges anyone with information that may be relevant to come forward as soon as possible." The case is now the subject of a government investigation, following claims made by a whistleblower athlete who was banned for breaching anti-doping rules in 2014. According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the organisation was "deeply concerned and shocked by the allegations" and it would conduct an independent review into the case. World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live it was "pretty dreadful news" and backed calls for an inquiry, but added: "It is best to wait for Ukad to do their own investigation, then we have full knowledge of the facts to work with. "My own guess is if they had sufficient evidence then they would have acted." Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

9 March 2017 Last updated at 17:03 GMT The 19-year-old from Dublin is a competitive runner - but her chronic epilepsy means she has around 16 seizures a day, often during races. When other competitors see her fall to the ground, they naturally believe she needs to go to hospital - even though she normally recovers immediately and in her case, there's no need for medical intervention. Even though she's grateful for the public response, all Katie wants to do is carry on running. When she told the neurologist who's treating her condition, he offered to become her running partner - and together they've become a marathon-running team.

SKN Heritage Museum is showing the type of belongings brought by African-Caribbean immigrants in the 1940s and 50s. The Windrush generation responded to adverts to work in Britain but were only allowed to bring one suitcase. Organisers said the display gives a unique insight into important part of Nottingham's history. The Windrush was named after the first boat which brought people from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948. The exhibition, called 'From Caribbean Isles to the British Isles -Home to Home', aims to give an insight into people who travelled across the Atlantic to seek a better life in what was still the Empire's "mother country". Item include photographs, clothes, records and games - as well as beauty products designed for black skin and hair when none were commercially available. Catherine Ross, the museum's founder, cameto Nottingham from St Kitts when she was just seven years old. She said: "Our aim is to let everyone know about the contributions that Caribbeans have made to British society and Nottingham and commemorate these achievements. "There'sno better place tostart than Nottingham Carnival, as it's such awell known and celebratory event in Nottingham's calendar." The carnival is taking place for the first time take in two sites - the Forest Recreation Ground on Saturday and the Victoria Embankment on Sunday.	A unique perspective on a landmark social event is to be unveiled as part of Nottingham's Caribbean Carnival.
Peter Bunyan, 53, of Brooklands Road, Cosby, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Derby Crown Court. The court heard a witness saw him forcing entry into 84-year-old Brian Robson's house on 23 February. Police then found Mr Robson with fatal head injuries. Bunyan will be sentenced at a later date. Police told the court they arrived at the address to find Mr Robson in the hall and attempts to revive him failed. Bunyan had returned to his house next door and was arrested there. Det Insp Chris Barratt, from Leicestershire Police, said: "Bunyan's actions on that tragic day led to the death of a very much loved family man and devastated a family. "I would like to offer my condolences to the family and thank them for their co-operation and understanding throughout our investigation and subsequent court proceedings."	A Leicestershire man has admitted killing his neighbour after kicking down his front door.
The Lucky Country by Donald Horne, which came out in 1964, has gone on to become a cult classic, as well as saddling this land with an entirely misappropriated nickname. On arriving in Australia just over a year ago, it was the first book I read having received a recommendation from my predecessor. "That sounds upbeat," I thought, seeking inspiration for my new life down under. It is, however, a thoroughly depressing read. A damning and bleak assessment of Australian society in the early 1960s. "A bucket of cold saltwater emptied onto the belly of a dreaming sunbather," is how one critic described it at the time. The opening words of its final chapter sum up the book's thesis: "Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise." Essentially, Horne painted a picture of a deeply conservative and unambitious country that had got to where it was by luck rather than merit, riding on the coat tails of its historical ties to Britain. "In the lucky style we have never 'earned' our democracy. We simply went along with some British habits," Horne wrote in his 1976 follow-up, Death of a Lucky Country. The fact that the book's title was ironic and that most people referring these days to Australia as The Lucky Country do so in a positive light, drove Horne round the bend. "I have had to sit through the most appalling rubbish as successive generations misapplied this phrase," Horne later went on to say. In 1964 though, despite being unoptimistically received by its publisher, The Lucky Country clearly touched a nerve with the Australian public. It sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year, an Australian record for a book of its type. It's now in its sixth edition. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently described the book's publication as one of the defining moments in Australia's history. The question for many is whether Donald Horne's assessment still applies. Does Australia remain the Lucky Country? It is undoubtedly a successful and prosperous one. When the world's leaders come to Brisbane in a few weeks for the G20 summit, with an agenda including trying to lift more of the global population out of poverty, they will be doing so from the five-star comfort of an incredibly affluent society. A study by investment bank Credit Suisse recently judged Australians to be the richest people in the world, with a median Australian adult worth more than US$225,000 (A$258,000), most of that due to high property values. Research by the Economist Intelligence Unit listed Australia as the second best country in the world to be born, beaten only by the high-flying Swiss. Australian cities regularly pepper the top 10 of best places to live. Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide all made it into the business end of the Economist's latest liveability index. And before the rest of the world gets too green with envy, those cities are also among the most expensive places to set up home. As in most wealthy countries, however, there are pockets of extreme poverty here. Australia's indigenous population fares especially badly. Life expectancy, a key economic indicator, for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is more than 10 years less than for the non-indigenous population. A recent study by the Australian Council of Social Service showed that one in seven Australians live below the poverty line. But the poverty line is Australia is considered to US$350 (A$400) a week for a single adult and US$740 (A$840) a week for a couple with two children. That's not a lot of money to live on in Australia but it compares pretty well to the world's other wealthy nations, let alone the poor ones. The US Census Bureau considers the poverty line to be just US$228 (A$260) a week for a single adult and  US$454 (A$515) a week for a family of two adults and 2 children. In Australia, the average wage in May 2014 before tax was US$51,383 (A$58,239) a year and US$69,413 (A$78,701) for full time workers. In 2013 the average wage for an US individual was just US$43,041 (A$48,784) and the median wage was just US$28,031 (A$31,757). An Australian friend of mine joked to me the other day: "Forget the whinging poms, we've become a nation of whinging Aussies." He suggested people in Sydney regard A$100,000 (US$88,0000) as a normal wage for a relatively successful person. Australia has enjoyed 23 years of consecutive economic growth. It has been one of the world's few developed economies to avoid the global financial crisis. Much of that success has been built on the country's vast mineral wealth, a mining boom that has lasted more than a decade and which arguably is still going, be it at a slower pace. Some might argue that mineral wealth again makes Australia a lucky country; one which hasn't got rich through innovation but rather through the good fortune to sit on huge piles of coal, iron ore, copper and uranium. Of course that's not to say that many other countries haven't profited from similar good fortune. Saudi Arabia must surely be the luckiest of them all. But in the innovation stakes, Australia still fares pretty badly. The Economist's Economic Innovation Index has Australia ranked 22nd, way behind the likes of Japan, the US, Germany and Sweden. Similarly on the magazine's Technological Readiness Index, Australia again fails to get into the top 20 - trailing behind the likes of Portugal, Belgium, Israel and Iceland. Anyone who's experienced Australia's mind-numbingly slow internet connections can testify to that particular low score. Australia has long been promising to embrace "the Asian Century". The country once faced the "tyranny of distance" in terms of European export markets but now finds itself practically on the doorstep of the fast growing economies of East Asia. Yet successive governments have still not managed to meet their pledges to increase the teaching of Asian languages in Australia's schools. Donald Horne died in 2005 as Australia entered the peak years of its prosperity. We'll never know if he would still consider his homeland to be the Lucky Country. All this is not to say that Australia is not a wonderful place to live. I, for one, can vouch for Sydney as being one of the world's coolest and most fabulous cities. I feel lucky to be here. As to whether I got here on merit, I'll leave that for others to judge.	It's 50 years since the publication of one of Australia's most iconic books.

The stormy weather made for treacherous racing on slippery roads but Team Sky's Froome survived the final descent into Morzine to maintain his overall lead. Froome's lead over Romain Bardet of four minutes five seconds will not be tested on the final stage in Paris. Stage 20 was won by Spanish Movistar rider Jon Izaguirre. He rode clear of fellow breakaway riders Jarlinson Pantano of the IAM Cycling team and 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali to win the 146km stage in four hours, six minutes and 45 seconds. Froome, who crashed on a rainy descent on Friday, was more cautious on Saturday's drop into Morzine and finished more than four minutes behind Izaguirre but only a few seconds adrift of his rivals in the overall standings. "I still need to get the yellow jersey to Paris tomorrow but certainly the racing side is done and dusted," said Froome, who won the 2013 and 2015 editions of the three-week race. "It's an amazing feeling of relief, just coming over the last line today. Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more." Frenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he "suffered from allergies" during the race, will finish third. Tradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint. The 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne. The stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time. In doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three. Froome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title. Tour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him. "There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years," he said. "When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier. I liked it very much. Chris Froome was very good, his opponents less good." Britain's Adam Yates will finish a terrific fourth overall and in possession of the white jersey as the best rider under the age of 25. The 23-year-old from Bury was second from stages seven to 12, and only lost third place to Nairo Quintana, one of the pre-race favourites, on Friday's penultimate stage in the mountains. However, his initial nine-second deficit became 19 when he was penalised 10 seconds for receiving a push from an Orica BikeExchange team-mate. That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana. Yates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes. Froome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day. He had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates. Geraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour. All of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders. In the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali. Nibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour. "I think my parents must have been scared watching at home," he said. "I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint. Beating Nibali in a downhill is something that counts in a career." General classification after stage 20: 1. Chris Froome (GB/Team Sky)     86hrs 21mins 40secs 2.

The teenager was arrested outside a takeaway in Heywood in August 2008 for being disruptive. She alleged one of the workers had groomed and then raped her. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) investigated Kabeer Hassan and another man, aged 59, but it was nearly a year later when a CPS lawyer decided to drop the case. According to Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the North West, the lawyer had viewed six hours of video testimony from the girl and also had DNA evidence, but decided "she would not be viewed as a credible witness by a jury". Hassan and the other man, who cannot be named, have been convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court with seven others, all from Greater Manchester, who groomed young girls for sex by plying them with drink and drugs. The file of the girl's allegations was one of the first on Mr Afzal's desk when he started his new job in the summer of 2011 and he took "an immediate decision" to prosecute Hassan and the 59-year-old man. By then GMP's Operation Span, launched in December 2009, was under way investigating allegations from other under-age girls in the Rochdale and Heywood areas relating to the other defendants. However, Mr Afzal maintains he would have charged both men even if the only evidence available had been that which led to the original case being dropped. "I took the view that a jury would have found her a credible witness," he said. "I regret that the wrong decision was made." Mr Afzal said his decision to prosecute was based on 20 years experience including expertise in rape cases. The CPS's dropping of the original case led police to stop all investigations, a decision that is now the subject of separate inquiry. The original lawyer, whose decision was reviewed and backed by a CPS unit manager, has been taken off rape cases and is undergoing retraining. The way GMP treated the 2008 allegations is at the centre of a managed investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). It was only after a second girl made similar claims in December 2009 that detectives began Operation Span. Police went on to find more than 40 vulnerable and at risk girls across Rochdale and Heywood subjected to on-street grooming by a network of men, mostly takeaway employees and taxi drivers. All five girls who were witnesses in the gang's conviction were known to social services at some stage in their lives. GMP is not commenting directly on the IPCC inquiry, but Assistant Chief Constable Steven Heywood concedes the force has made mistakes. "We apologise to anyone that has suffered due to any failing on our part, " he said. "We probably could have done things better. "We and other agencies are on a journey, we know more about this kind of crime than we did in 2008."	Three years ago, a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer dropped a rape case involving an under-age girl which could have left a sex grooming ring undetected for years.

Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as  V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same "nursery" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

He died in a Dublin Hospital at 06:40 GMT on Friday. Fr Reid, 82, a  member of the Redemptorist order, secretly acted as a conduit between the republican movement and the SDLP. He was one of the witnesses who confirmed the decommissioning of IRA weapons. In recent years, he was involved in talks with Basque nationalists seeking independence from Spain. In 1988, Fr Reid was pictured praying over the bodies of Army corporals Derek Wood and David Howes who had been dragged from their car, beaten and shot by the IRA. The corporals had inadvertently driven into the midst of a republican funeral in Belfast. The photograph of the bloodstained priest crouched praying over one of the soldiers was one of the starkest images of the Northern Ireland Troubles. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Fr Alec Reid's intervention to administer last rites epitomised his enormous faith and strength of conviction. "His comfort was given amidst the enormous fears and tension on that terrible day in March 1988." Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said Clonard monastery, Fr Reid's base in west Belfast during the Troubles, was "the cradle of the peace process". He told RTÉ Radio he was with Fr Reid on Thursday night in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and had been due to visit him again on Friday. "What Alec Reid did was, he lived the gospel message. He developed a view which was contrary to the official view, that there had to be dialogue, and he was tenacious." Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: "I heard with sadness of the death of Fr Reid. "We all owe a debt of gratitude to him for the role he played in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland." Former SDLP leader John Hume said Fr Reid was "not simply a go between" in the early days of negotiating for peace. "He was an active player in fighting for an end to violence," Mr Hume said. "Without his courage, determination and utter selflessness, the road to peace in our region would have been much longer and much more difficult to traverse. "While we mourn the loss of a great man, we must also celebrate the legacy of peace and an opportunity to reconcile our people that he gave to us. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to waste." Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, said: "His ministering of the last rites to the two British corporals brutally killed in 1988 offered us an image of decency struggling to assert itself amidst brutality." There were tears and tributes in west Belfast as news broke of the death of Fr Alec Reid. "He should have got a Nobel Peace Prize," said one man. "But maybe he turned it down. The only prize he wanted was peace." One elderly woman, tears streaming down her face, said: "He should be remembered with respect. "He was someone who children should aspire to be like." Fr Reid's funeral will take place at 12:00 GMT on Wednesday after requiem Mass in Clonard church in west Belfast.	Fr Alec Reid, who was a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, acting as a go-between between the IRA and politicians, has died.
Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy in an exercise some parents said amounted to indoctrination. Officials said the schools were closed out of an "abundance of caution" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to: "There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region's religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school's doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because they were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, they said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non-religious example of Arabic. The decision to close the schools has drawn criticism as well. "It looks like fear wins again," a resident told the News Virginian newspaper. On the paper's Facebook account, locals have been debating the closure with one man saying, "our patriot forefathers are rolling in their graves," and another rhetorically posting, "how do these terrified people leave their houses every day?"	A school district in the US state of Virginia has closed all schools on Friday after a geography lesson that included Islam sparked vociferous complaints from around the country.
Jhanvi Ahuja was visiting the India Gate monument in Delhi on the night of 28 September with her parents and other relatives when she disappeared. She was found on Sunday night with a placard around her neck with her name and her uncle's telephone number on it. A passer-by who found her called her family and informed the police. After the child went missing, her family launched a campaign - Bring Back Jhanvi - on Facebook, Twitter and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to find her. "She was found standing on a road outside a gurudwara (Sikh temple) in Janakpuri area in west Delhi," Jhanvi's uncle Gaurav Chopra told the BBC. "She had a little board hanging around her neck. It gave her name and her father's name. It said she was lost at India Gate and asked anyone who found her to call her father. The board had my mobile phone number written on it." Mr Chopra said he asked the caller, a teenager, to sit with the child while he drove to the area. "The people who had taken her had shaved her head but I immediately recognised her. I started crying, she also started crying. I gave her some chocolates. She looked a little tense, but she was fine and in good health." Mr Chopra took her to the police station where Jhanvi's parents also arrived and identified her. Her father Rakesh Ahuja told reporters that it was like "a rebirth of a daughter". It is not yet known who took away the child but police say they suspect her kidnappers panicked and abandoned her following a widespread media coverage of the case and the social media campaign. Some suspect that her head was shaved to change her appearance. Child rights organisations says nearly 96,000 children disappear in India every year and that most of the missing children end up as labour, in brothels or in other exploitative situations. Activists say the authorities are not doing enough to stop child trafficking but officials claim a lack of resources and co-ordination on a national level makes tracing missing children difficult.	A three-year-old Indian girl who went missing a week ago has been found after her family launched a massive social media campaign.
Mr Newman was detained in Melbourne on Thursday after entering Australia without a visa. Australia had cancelled his visa while he was still in the US on the grounds that his presence in the country could incite violence. Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and said women who have abortions are murderers. On Friday, Justice Geoffrey Nettle in Melbourne ruled that the cancellation of Mr Newman's visa was justified, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While Mr Newman may have had a case to challenge the cancellation, he should not have boarded a plane to Australia without a visa, said the judge. "Acting as he did means he does not come to this court with clean hands," he said. Mr Newman, also known as Troy Newman-Mariotti, had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia. But he was prevented from boarding a connecting flight in the US city of Denver on Tuesday after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton cancelled his visa. It came after it emerged he had called in a 2000 book for doctors who perform abortions to face execution . His wife Mellissa had presented his appeal to the high court in Melbourne. "I don't know what they're afraid of. I don't know what they think he's going to do here," she was quoted as saying earlier by ABC News. In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa "was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence". "My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself," he said. Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an "anti-choice extremist". But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that he "has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change".	US anti-abortion campaigner Troy Newman is to be deported from Australia after losing a high court appeal.
Paul Good, 53, and Darryl Shellard, 45, both from Liverpool were convicted of fraud and jailed for eight and seven years each. Lee Doran, 45, of Huyton was sentenced to 16 months for admitting fraud. Merseyside Police said one businessman even lost his home as a result of the scam. The fraud involved sales staff, such as Doran, posing as cold callers from the emergency services to sell advertising for non-existent publications, said police. Shellard, and Good of Knight Street, Liverpool, targeted small firms and start-up businesses sending a sample copy to their clients who were then given 28 days to pay in full. Det Con Clare Walsh from the force's Economic Interventions unit said some offences dated back 10 years with victims spread across the UK. "This type of fraud is not a victimless crime - while initial amounts taken were often small, in some cases bills eventually ran to thousands of pounds, which had a devastating effect on the business and individuals involved, with one business owner even losing his own home as a result of their actions." Shellard, of Tancred Road, also admitted perjury in a civil court.	Three conmen have been jailed for a £4.5m fraud selling bogus advertising space to small companies who were taken to court if they did not pay up.
The 400-member Santee Sioux tribe already runs a casino, hotel and ranch and hopes the resort will be a new revenue generator. Marijuana is not legal in South Dakota but the tribe has been permitted to grow and sell pot since June. It will open on New Year's Eve and only be sold on the reservation. Sioux leaders would grow the marijuana to be offered in a smoking lounge. The lounge would have games, food and a bar, and eventually slot machines and a music venue. "We want it to be an adult playground," tribal president Anthony Reider told the AP news agency. "There's nowhere else in America that has something like this." Tribe leaders predict the resort would make up to $2m (Â£1.3m) per month. Marijuana is growing at a facility on the reservation now and they hope to sell it for the first time on 31 December at a New Year's Eve party. The Justice Department put out a new policy allowing Native American tribes to grow and sell marijuana in a similar way to some US states like Colorado in 2014. The strict provision does not allow tribes to sell marijuana to minors or grow it on public land. Marijuana will be sold in sealed one-gram packages for $12.50 (Â£8.27) to $15, and people will only be able to buy one gram at a time. "[The tribe] must look at these opportunities because in order to preserve the past we do have to advance in the present," said Mr Reider.	A Native American tribe in the US state of South Dakota has said it plans to open what would be the first marijuana resort in the US.
The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning. It was suggested the problem with the escape chute could be because a crew member was more used to opening a door on the opposite side of the plane.	Passengers escaped a smoke-filled plane by jumping from the wing after a series of problems caused by an electrical fault, investigators say.
His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as "a shock but not a surprise". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an "heroic figure" whose "escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history". Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a "major emblematic figure".	One of the leading figures of the French resistance against the Nazis, Raymond Aubrac, has died aged 97, his family says.
Carmarthenshire council funded chief executive Mark James in his case over remarks made on Jacqui Thompson's blog. Mr James said in 2012 he would not keep any damages he won. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, must pay Mr James damages of £25,000 in instalments but Mr James's lawyers would not say if this had been or would be given to the council. As well as the damages, Mrs Thompson must also pay about £5,000 in interest and nearly £15,000 in costs for March's enforcement hearing - all the money is due by 2032. BBC Wales understands the legal fees paid by the council on Mr James's behalf were in excess of £35,000. The authority's pledge to cover these fees was found to be unlawful by the Wales Audit Office. Mr James said in 2012 he was not motivated by money and vowed any damages he won would "be paid over to the authority". When asked if this was still the case, his solicitors, Acuity Legal, said Mr James "did not intend to give any further statements or any interviews on this subject". At a hearing at Carmarthen County Court on 23 March to determine a possession order on Mrs Thompson's house, Mark Spackman, on behalf of Mr James, said this was his intention "on a voluntary basis" but was "irrelevant" to the hearing. Judge John Parsons said: "Mr Spackman has told us he's entitled to change his mind... and it appears he has." The council is not seeking to recoup the money it paid for Mr James's legal fees but is pursuing £190,393 owed by Mrs Thompson. A High Court ruling said the blogger's "unlawful campaign of harassment and defamation" against Mr James meant she was "the author of her own misfortune". Mrs Thompson said it would be "completely unacceptable" if Mr James had changed his mind and chosen to keep the money A council spokesman said: "The council's position on this matter is well documented and subject of public record. There is nothing further to add."	A council boss has refused to say if he will honour a vow to repay compensation won in a libel case to the authority.
The plans would allow victims to ask for a case to be reviewed when police identified a suspect but did not pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. The policy would begin with rape and child sexual exploitation cases. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was time to "put victims in the driving seat". The CPS already has a right to review scheme in place, where victims can request a review of their case if it is dropped by prosecutors before reaching the courtroom. Labour said it intended to extend this to decisions by the police. Ms Cooper said: "Rape and child sexual exploitation are vile crimes that ruin lives and destroy families. "Too often victims and survivors aren't listened to and aren't heard, especially children. "And although reports to the police have gone up, arrests and prosecutions have gone down. "But right now if the police decide not to pursue a crime, there is little more victims or their families can do. That's not good enough. "We'll change the law so that if the police decide to drop a case after a suspect has been identified, victims will have a new right to challenge their decision. "It's time to change the culture, stop these awful crimes being hidden away and put victims in the driving seat." Main pledges Labour said that of 16,300 complaints of rape made to the police in England and Wales in 2012-13, 5,400 were passed to the CPS. The party said a decision to drop a case when a suspect had been identified would follow the process used by the CPS, of local resolution followed by independent review. Under the plans, the decision to drop the case would be first be checked by a prosecutor who has not been involved with the case previously. Labour said it would ensure victims were provided with a clear and detailed explanation of the decision and the local resolution would normally be completed within 10 days of the receipt of a request for review. If the victim were not satisfied with the local resolution, the decision would be independently reviewed by another prosecutor. Former Thames Valley Chief Constable and head of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: "It is critical that victims have a right to review decisions all the way from the duty to record and allegation, through to decisions on whether to pursue a prosecution. "Not only does this put the spotlight of accountability on the police, but it also gives the victim an important additional opportunity to influence their case and understand the decisions. "Sometimes this will encourage a fresh angle to the case; sometimes there will be no new avenues. But there should always be a full and frank explanation of the steps taken to bring an offender to justice and the rationale for police decision."	Labour has said it would give victims of sexual offences the right to challenge decisions by police not to prosecute suspects.
The 39-year-old, who goes by the name Mick Fett, was born the year the first film in the series came out. Since the 1990s, Fett has amassed a vast collection of action figures, costumes and other merchandise. His collection fills the five-bedroom home he shares with his girlfriend and is estimated to be worth A$500,000 (Â£300,000; $370,000). "I mentioned that I had some Star Wars stuff when we first got together," he told the BBC. "She was a bit overwhelmed at first and then she sort of adapted." The suburban house is filled with a life-size Han Solo carbonite statue, priceless vintage toys and a vast collection of creatures from across the galaxy. There's an entire room dedicated to arcade games and even a pod-racer in the backyard. Only one room does not have Star Wars memorabilia in it - the main bathroom.

"It's two different worlds. The guys at work can't believe what I do in my Star Wars time and all my Star Wars friends can't believe I'm a police officer." The idea to redecorate the Darth Vader costume began when he attended an overseas Star Wars convention. He originally intended to attend the event as a Stormtrooper with an Australian flag cape. But at the suggestion the idea evolved. "One of my mates said: 'Why don't you go out and spray paint the entire costume?' I thought - instead of doing a Stormtrooper why not Vader?" The Down Under alter ego of the Sith Lord has since become a huge hit - at home and abroad. "I don't know whether Aussie Vader is a villain or a Rebel," he laughed. "I'm a bit of a Rogue One myself." "One of my favourite sayings is 'May the Force be with you, mate,'" he said. "The cape is an Australian flag. I've got beer cans on my belt and blue flames airbrushed onto my helmet and chest piece. I've even made a custom light-sabre with a didgeridoo handle." He has already seen the new Star Wars film Rogue One, once at the red carpet premiere and again at a midnight screening with fans. "It definitely beat all my expectations," he said, adding that the latest blockbuster is a great tribute to the original trilogy. "Empire Strikes Back was dark and gritty. Rogue One has a lot of those elements too." Reporting by the BBC's Greg Dunlop	A Sydney police officer and huge Star Wars fan has become a local hit after creating a Darth Vader costume painted with the Australian flag.
Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch of a whole new BBC Scotland channel entirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a "Scottish Six" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a "Scottish Six" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but "progress and hopefully sign of new thinking". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks "entirely political". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.	The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible.
Lachie Stewart, 30, from Easter Ross, was thought to have been travelling to Delhi when he lost touch with his family earlier this month. However, a Facebook page set up as part of efforts to find him, said he had been found on Saturday. Mr Stewart had been working on a contract in Bhogpur in India before his disappearance. His family and friends had made contact with the Foreign Office after becoming increasingly concerned when he failed to make contact by his  birthday on Thursday. Details about his whereabouts have not been released.	A Scottish architect who had been reported missing in India is understood to have been found.
The Washington Post demanded impeachment, followed by a Senate trial. Time magazine, deeming it necessary to publish its first-ever editorial, thundered: "The president should resign." Outside the White House, protesters waved placards at passing motorists: "Honk for Impeachment." Even Washington's most influential columnist, Stewart Alsop, who was normally supportive of the president, called him an "ass." The president had lost his moral authority, argued his critics, and with it, his ability to govern. The country faced a constitutional crisis. The republic was imperilled. Such was the feverish reaction to the events of 20 October, 1973, a date remembered in the national memory as the "Saturday Night Massacre" - a pivotal moment in the unfolding Watergate controversy. With scandal engulfing the White House, Richard Nixon decided to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate "all offenses arising out of the 1972 election â€¦ involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments". Nixon's Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and his Deputy Attorney General, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the president's order. Eventually, the Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in command at the justice department, was prepared to fire Cox. The White House announced the news at 8:22pm that Saturday evening. Yesterday, almost as quickly as the news that he had been sacked as head of the FBI reached James Comey in Los Angeles, these two dramatic episodes were being described as historically analogous. The president had fired the lead figure in an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by members of his own team. The Nixonian parallels were obvious. Roger Stone, a Trump associate who also worked in 1972 for the notorious Committee to Re-elect the President, told the New York Times: "Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling." The Nixon presidential library even trolled the White House on Twitter: "FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian." Democrats insinuated that Comey was fired for similar reasons to Cox, because he was closing in on the truth. There were other resemblances, too. In the lead-up to the Saturday Night Massacre, the Nixon White House was still reeling from the resignation of the president's chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, a central figure in the Watergate scandal, just as the Trump administration continues to be buffeted by the swirl of controversy surrounding the forced departure of General Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor. There's the suspicion now, as there was four decades ago, that an embattled White House has something to hide. So is this truly a re-run of the events of 1973? Is the past repeating itself? Even by the standards of the Nixon presidency, the autumn of 1973 was unusually chaotic. It saw the resignation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew because of fraud, tax evasion, bribery and extortion allegations. The Middle East was in the grip of the Yom Kippur war, a conflict between US-backed Israel and Arab forces armed by the Soviets that threatened to blow-up into a broader conflagration between Washington and Moscow. In Washington, Nixon was fighting a pitched battle with Archibald Cox and the courts. Cox, a Harvard professor who had been appointed as special prosecutor in May that year, had issued a subpoena ordering the White House to hand over nine tapes of phone calls and West Wing conversations in connection with the Watergate break-in. Nixon's legal team argued the principle of executive privilege should apply, and the tapes should remain private. On 12 October, however, the Court of Appeals in Washington upheld a lower court's ruling granting Cox's request. Rather than comply, Nixon decided to fire the special prosecutor, something his Attorney General Elliot Richardson had promised Congress would never happen. A president stood in defiance of the courts, putting himself above the law of the land. It was a textbook constitutional crisis. Donald Trump's sacking of his FBI director, while highly unusual and deeply controversial, is constitutionally permissible. No court orders have been flouted. The president, while breaking with the norm of allowing FBI directors to serve out their ten-year terms unimpeded, is not putting himself above the law. Trump's motivations may also be different. Nixon sacked Cox through fear his criminality was about to exposed. Within the FBI, agents believe that Trump sacked Comey primarily out of pique and spite because of his refusal to publicly exonerate Trump against allegations of collusion with the Kremlin, and also because Comey refused to back up Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama ordered the wire-tapping of Trump Tower. Unlike the Saturday Night Massacre, the president is at one with the most high-ranking figures in the Justice Department rather than at odds with them. The president, the attorney general and the deputy attorney general together they made the case that Comey should go - not purportedly because of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but because of the former director's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The politics is also very different. Back in 1973, the Democrats controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives. That put the investigative machinery of Congress in their hands. Senate hearings were already underway, and the Saturday Night Massacre gave them fresh impetus. Nixon also faced an acid shower of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and around the country. "Clearly we face a constitutional crisis," lamented the Republican governor of Michigan. There have been Republican critics of Trump's decision to fire Comey. But so far they haven't been so vehement. Crucially, the Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is resisting demands from the Democrats, and some in his own party, to back calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 2016 election. Politically, Donald Trump remains strong, because of the support of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill and his grassroots supporters in the American heartland. Nixon, by contrast, was politically weak. This became apparent only a few days later when the White House indicated it would hand over the tapes, which included a recording of the infamous conversation between the president and Haldeman, eighteen and half minutes of which were missing. Nixon was also forced to appoint a new special prosecutor. And eventually, of course, the push for impeachment gathered unstoppable momentum, and he was forced to resign as president. In 1973, Democrats were hollering impeachment. In 2017, the party's congressional leadership has not publicly uttered that explosive word. What maybe similar between now and then is the intemperate mood of the president. As demonstrated by his Twitter tirades, Donald Trump is lashing out publicly against his critics, much as Nixon did privately in his final months in office. Politico is reporting that Trump shouted at the television over the Russian investigation, which again has echoes of Nixon's executive mansion tantrums. Curiously, both presidents also saw Florida as a bolt-hole from the pressures of Washington, Nixon opting for Key Biscayne, Trump regularly visiting Mar-A-Lago - although a key difference is that Nixon medicated himself with alcohol, while Trump is famously teetotal. But the Saturday Night Massacre and the Tuesday Night 'You're fired" are not directly comparable. The sacking of Archibald Cox contributed heavily to Nixon's forced departure from the White House. It was widely seen as an impeachable offence. The removal of James Comey, in and of itself, does not pose such an existential threat to the Trump administration.	The New York Times called for the president to leave office immediately, describing it as "the last great service" he could perform for the country.
What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as "mobile workers" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the "overwhelming majority" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. "I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have," Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments: This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our "pickup" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere. Susan Bird, Kent	Time spent travelling to and from first and last jobs by workers who do not have a fixed office should be regarded as work, European judges have ruled.
The partially-dismembered body of David Miller, 56, was found at his flat in Patterdale Walk in Boothville, Northampton, on 14 June 2016. He had been stabbed multiple times and "crude attempts" were made to destroy his body, a court heard. Ian Cuthbertson, 49, Michael Hallett, 37, Joseph Catlin, 30, and Zena Kane, 35, of no fixed address, deny murder. At the start of their trial, Northampton Crown Court heard police officers had forced entry into the flat and found Mr Miller's remains in the bedroom. Several items were found at the property including knives, scissors and a rolling pin which had been used as weapons during the attack on 10 June, and an angle grinder which had been borrowed to try and destroy the body. A post-mortem examination found he had substantial facial injuries and had been stabbed fifteen times in the back and in the chest. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said that Mr Catlin had been living with Mr Miller in the two months before his death and that the pair had known each other for years. The court heard that Mr Miller was "well known and well liked" in the area but had long-standing issues with drink. Mr Joyce said the four defendants were part of the "Northampton street drinking fraternity". "They lived chaotic lives with long periods of homelessness and regularly used Mr Miller's flat as a place to drink, " he said. "These four defendants all took part in the murder of a vulnerable man in his own home and then spent days trying to cover up what they had done," he added. The trial, expected to last for four weeks, continues.	A jury has heard how a "vulnerable" man died after a "sustained attack" with knives and scissors in his own home.
It follows the arrest of an former ombudsman investigator over an alleged theft of sensitive security documents. It is understood the documents contained information the police and security service MI5 believe could put the lives of individuals at risk. The PFNI said it was an "astounding and very worrying state of affairs". A 69-year-old man was arrested in Dartford, Kent, on Sunday after detectives from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch conducted a joint search with local police. It is understood he retired from the ombudsman's office a number of years ago and that the documents do not refer to any case currently being investigated by it. Mark Lindsay, chair of the federation, said there had to be an element of fairness for police officers under investigation. "They need the same protections that a normal member of society would have and that doesn't exist at the moment with the ombudsman's office," he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. "There is a real role for the Police Ombudsman's office, but that office has to hold the confidence of police officers." The police have begun a criminal investigation into the issue and have also suspended the release of any further sensitive material to the ombudsman's office until a review of security protocols is carried out. The Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott said the ombudsman's office had serious questions to answer. "When there's alleged wrongdoing, the PSNI should be called in at an earlier stage to investigate these matters so that they can be independently investigated," Mr Elliott told the BBC. "There is a failure and a gap there that needs to be resolved." In a statement to the BBC, a spokesman for the ombudsman confirmed he was alerted by police last week about the theft of sensitive material originating from the office. The office of the Police Ombudsman said it was anticipated that this suspension of the sharing of sensitive material "will be temporary."	The Police Federation of Northern Ireland (PFNI) has called for a "full inquiry" into the operation of the police ombudsman.
Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europe now had to "fight for its own destiny". Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September. "The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days," Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: "We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands." On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as "very unsatisfactory". Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week. Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change. Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees. Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September. It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd. But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them. Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny. No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business. With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party. She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September.	Europe can no longer "completely depend" on the US and UK following the election of President Trump and Brexit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says.
The West Indian Carnival in Leeds was launched in 1967 and once again will take over Potternewton Park for the August bank holiday weekend. An exhibition recording its heritage, political and cultural legacy is planned for the city's Tetley gallery. There will also be a week of new plays commemorating carnival at West Yorkshire Playhouse. Live updates and more from Yorkshire Additionally, it has been announced that an illuminated night carnival will kick-off the annual arts and light festival Light Night in October. A recreation of the Sun Goddess, the first Leeds Carnival Queen costume, will be featured at the exhibition from August to October. The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through Chapeltown and Harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur France initiated it after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis. Mr France, head of the organising committee, said: "When you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music." However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr France said he was "very sad and upset" at the council decision but added that it would not "dampen my spirits". Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: "A lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible." Ms Blake added: "The oldest carnival in Europe is here in Leeds. We are so keen to make sure as a city we come together and everyone celebrates an incredible achievement." She praised Mr France as a "legend" that had made "an absolutely fantastic contribution heading up a brilliant team of people".	Plans have been announced for the "oldest carnival in Europe" to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Ahead of talks with his US counterpart James Mattis, Sir Michael said too few of the 28 members were meeting Nato's annual 2% defence spending target and countries needed to "raise their game". The Trump administration has said other countries must bear more of the cost. Sir Michael said UK spending was rising but the armed forces must continue to ensure they were "fit for purpose". Gen Mattis said Britain was an example to other states and its "global leadership is needed today as much as at any time in history". The Times has reported that the Ministry of Defence is facing a Â£10bn budget shortfall in the next decade, suggesting this could lead to further cuts in personnel. At the moment, only five of the 28 Nato members - including the US and the UK - spend 2% of their annual income on defence. The White House has warned that the US could "moderate" its commitment to the 70-year-old defence partnership if other countries don't commit more resources. Sir Michael, who is holding talks with the retired Marine Corps general, said the US had always been the financial mainstay of Nato and no-one wanted to see it retreat from this. He said the UK had always met the 2% target but too many others did not and this was no longer acceptable. "There are five members of Nato who don't even spend 1% and I will be working with Jim Mattis on persuading them that they have to raise their game," he said. "We want other countries to shoulder a fairer share. For instance, getting them to commit to annual increases, and putting the 2% target into their policy documents." He suggested that publishing a table every year of the progress countries were making towards the 2% target would "shame the others into increasing their defence spending." Speaking at a joint press conference in Lancaster House, Sir Michael said Nato was the cornerstone of Western security but needed to be "fitter and faster". Gen Mattis said the two countries were on an "equal footing" in terms of confronting the threat from terrorism, standing together as "bulwarks against maniacs who think by hurting us they can scare us". Their "special relationship", he argued, was "not a historical artefact but a source of strength today for our two nations". The two are discussing measures to modernise Nato, including streamlining command structures, as well as progress on a series of joint equipment projects including the F-35 Lightning joint strike fighter. Sir Michael announced Â£90m investment at RAF Marham in Norfolk to support Britain's consignment of the new aircraft. But the defence secretary is facing questions about the UK's own future capability amid reports that financial pressures could result in cuts to personnel, including to the Royal Marines. The defence secretary said the UK had the fifth largest defence budget in the world and the government was committed to increase defence spending ever year up to 2020, including building many new warships. But he said the armed forces were not immune from having to become more efficient and to adapt to changes in what was being asked of them. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the "balance" of resources within the Royal Navy was a matter for the First Sea Lord. "What I am saying to you is we have 7,000 Royal Marines... and I have not agreed any cut in the size of the Royal Marines," he said. He added: "What we are looking at is the way in which our armed forces work, the different tasks that they have and we are constantly looking to see that they are fit for purpose in what we do. "So if something is no longer needed, if it's redundant, we need to make sure that we can put the savings back into new equipment. "That applies to buildings, it also applies to the way we work and the efficiencies we need." But Labour said "mistakes and poor decisions" since 2010 were now coming home to roost and ministers must be clear about where future savings would come from. "Further cuts of Â£1bn each year, to make up for this mis-management of the defence budget, will do yet more severe damage to our Armed Forces," said shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith. "Reports that the Royal Marines could be cut are particularly concerning...The defence secretary kept referring to investment in equipment but he needs to be investing in our forces personnel to ensure that professional standards remain high."	Nato members will be "shamed" into spending more on the alliance, defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said.
Barnsley's Ryan Kent almost caught keeper Chris Maxwell out at the near post with an inswinging corner. Striker Jordan Hugill pulled Preston's best first-half effort just wide from a tight angle from Paul Gallagher's pass. Tom Bradshaw had an effort blocked on the line for Barnsley and Adam Davies clawed away Hugill's header in added time to deny Preston a winner. Barnsley dropped a place to ninth, but only four points behind Sheffield Wednesday in sixth, while Simon Grayson's Preston also slipped one to 11th, three points further back. The home side gave a debut to loan signing Callum Elder at left-back, with Alex Mowatt suspended after being sent off against Wolves, while Preston recalled 6ft 6in Simon Makienok to spearhead their attack. An early header apart, Makienok was well marshalled by Marc Roberts and Angus MacDonald, and was eventually replaced by Jermaine Beckford. Bradshaw was denied by a defender on the line after sliding in to meet Kent's cross, but Davies pushing away Hugill's header as it flew towards the top corner was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock thereafter in a game of few clear-cut opportunities. Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:  "I was pleased with how we coped with their threats but I didn't feel that we did enough to win the game. "There were not enough crosses into the box, not enough efforts on goal. "I said at half-time I was conscious that I didn't want Preston to grind us down, because the team they picked and the message from Simon (Grayson) at the start of the game was that he wanted a tougher, more aggressive performance. "I don't even speak about the top six. It is about winning the next game, so it has not even entered my head. Preston boss Simon Grayson: "There are plenty of games still to go and there will be so many twists and turns from now until the end of the season. "We have aspirations to try and get there (the play-offs), but obviously we will need to turn these draws into wins if we are going to make up the ground on teams that are up there already. "Neither team really had that cutting edge to go and break down two resilient defensive performances today. "These games just hinge on a little bit of magic from somebody, and from our point of view we never really had that little bit of quality. Match ends, Barnsley 0, Preston North End 0.

Pedro, 25, had been training with the Cumbrians and impressed in reserve games against Barrow and Burnley. The Angola-born wide-man has spent much of his career in the Dutch league with teams such as Feyenoord and Heracles, plus stints in Bulgaria and Romania. "We've seen enough to know that he adds something different to the group," said head of recruitment Lee Dykes. He told the club website: "This is a chance for him to show everyone what he can do."

7 July 2016 Last updated at 09:49 BST Speaking to Today programme presenter John Humphrys, he accepted that in retrospect it would have been better to challenge the intelligence used to justify the war, but stood by his decision to join the invasion.	Tony Blair says people will not accept that he means his regret over mistakes in the Iraq war until he disowns the decision to join the US coalition to topple Saddam Hussein.
Photos on the internet appear to show Diouf in a nightclub, just hours before the match at Southampton on 24 March. "I've made some inquiries and I've asked him about it and he denies he was there," Saunders told Radio Sheffield. "It's still ongoing and I want to get to the bottom of it. It's something I can't comprehend if it is true." Rovers lost the match at St Mary's 2-0, with Diouf playing the full game, and are currently six points adrift of safety with six matches to play. Diouf has scored six goals in 22 games since joining the club in October.	Doncaster Rovers boss Dean Saunders says the club are continuing to investigate claims that forward El-Hadji Diouf breached club discipline.
The 65-year-old was found dead in the garden of his gated home in South Weald in June 2015. Although Essex Police originally thought he died of natural causes, it emerged he had been shot six times. Police said they had questioned a man originally from Tyneside but currently living in southern Spain. The force says the man was not arrested but volunteered to be interviewed at a police station in the UK. The force did not specify which police station he was interviewed at. The interview took place on Saturday morning. An inquest into Palmer's death concluded he was unlawfully killed. Police have said his shooting had "all the hallmarks of a professional hit". Palmer, once described as Britain's richest criminal and thought to have been worth £300m, got his nickname after he was arrested on suspicion of melting down gold from the Brink's-Mat robbery, although he was never convicted. The robbery in 1983 took place at Heathrow Airport when £25m worth of gold was stolen. At the time it was the biggest robbery to have ever taken place in the UK. The former scrap metal dealer, from Olton, near Birmingham,  who was one of seven children, was said to have melted the metal down in the back garden of his mansion at Lansdown near Bath. However, he denied knowing it was stolen and was acquitted in 1987, blowing kisses to the jury from the dock when the verdict was delivered. Worth about £500m in today's prices, most of the gold has never been recovered and the case remains open. In 1997 Palmer was arrested in Tenerife, and returned to the UK to face charges related to a large-scale timeshare fraud. In May 2001 he was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay a record confiscation order of £33m.	A 50-year-old man has been questioned on suspicion of the murder of notorious criminal John "Goldfinger" Palmer, detectives have said.
Lawnmowers, a scarifier and a turfer were taken from the Lockerbie site some time between 09:00 on Thursday and the same time on Friday. Det Con Scott Barr said it appeared to have been a "targeted raid" with a vehicle needed to remove the property. He appealed for anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to contact them as soon as possible.	Grass cutting equipment worth about £20,000 has been stolen from a south of Scotland bowling club.
It's an ambition voiced by many children. That is not surprising given that pretty much every one of them plays games on tablets, phones, consoles and PCs when they have a spare moment. It is certainly my son's goal. And like any dutiful parent, I'm keen to help him realise his ambition - or at least help him find out early on if it's not for him. I am also conscious that my lack of a formal technical background means that, at home, he'll struggle to get to grips with the core technical skill game making seems to demand - coding. This is a problem. What I know about the history of video games suggests many of those that made it in the industry started young. So, there was no better place to get answers about how to become a game maker than at Frontier Developments. The firm was founded by David Braben - the archetypal child programmer who, while still a teenager, co-wrote the legendary game Elite. The latest version of Elite was released late last year and Frontier is now almost fully occupied with maintaining and expanding the space trading and combat game. Frontier employs a lot of programmers, says Adam Woods, a producer on Elite, and it has a well-established career path for them all the way from graduate-entry through to head of technology. However, he says, there are plenty of other people at the firm that went via other routes. The studio's audio head, Jim Croft, started out as a musician and composer creating tunes for TV ads. Make Games. The best thing you could possibly do is start making games today. The reason I got my first job in the industry as a game designer was entirely down to the fact I was the only person who had his own finished video game to show off at interview. Not only did this demonstrate my ability, knowledge and experience far better than anything else I could show or say, but it shows an ability to finish what I start, and that I have a natural drive to develop video games. If you want to be a part of making games, make games today, and finish them. As many as you can. Show them to everyone you can and learn from everything you do wrong, which when you start off, will be almost everything. Nothing else you do is more important than this when it comes to succeeding as a game developer. Mr Woods knows his way around code but started out in QA - quality assurance - which involves playing Frontier games as they are being developed documenting bugs and crashes. "Now, as a producer, I help define the road map for the game for a set period of time - it could be for the next year or the next couple of weeks," he says. His job involves making sure the various teams at Frontier - coding, art, design, user interface, etc - are all on track to finish work on the next expansion or fix big bad bugs. "I break down the work that needs doing and get estimates about how long it is going to take," he says. "Towards delivery date I will chase bugs and make sure it all comes together." The producer role is just one of many that surrounds the programming heart of a game such as Elite Dangerous. Many of the people in those jobs are familiar with technology but coding is not essential to their day-to-day work. Frontier has product managers that help co-ordinate the overall direction of the game, community managers who handle player feedback, and lots of graphic designers who work on creating and animating all the bits that make up a modern title. That kind of diversity is to be expected in a sizeable studio such as Frontier, says Dr Jake Habgood, a former game-maker who now heads the software and games development degree course at Sheffield Hallam University. "If you have more than 150 people in a team you get roles that are very specialised," he says. For Dr Habgood, aspiring game makers would do well to grasp the difference between playing and creating. "One of the common misconceptions that people who to this have is that making and playing games is synonymous," he says. However, he adds, experts make what they do look easy while hiding what it took to master a skill. A game that is easy and fun to play would not necessarily have been as much fun, or as easy, to code and create. For Dr Habgood, coding is the key skill to master for any aspiring game maker and the Sheffield course emphasises hands-on programming skills. For youngsters, such as my 11-year-old, getting to grips with proper programming might be formidable but there were plenty of other ways to get a taste of game making without having to learn C++ or grapple with a command line. Tools including Scratch, Kodu from Microsoft, Game Maker by YoYo and even Unreal Engine 4 make it more straight-forward to make games. The most basic of these involves snapping virtual coding blocks together and even the more advanced ones, such as Unreal, conceal a lot of the in-depth coding. That hands-on experience is key to understand the game-making process, says Dr Habgood, for no other reason than it will bestow an understanding of what is special about the craft. "If you can find the creativity in programming and games you may see how compelling it can be," he explains. Creative breakthroughs aside, seeing a game through to completion is quite an achievement for anyone at any age. It involves real work and exposes one other truth about the industry. "It's very competitive and you have to be prepared to work hard and put a lot of hours in," he says. "If you don't, you won't make it." "It's you that matters, not the degree," he adds. "The degree will help but if you are not committed it will not help you get into the industry."	"I want to make games when I grow up."
Complaints have been made across the UK about the fad, which sees people dress up in order to frighten passers-by. Dyfed-Powys Police received about 30 reports over the weekend and North Wales Police said it was aware of incidents. Gwent Police had 18 reports, including clowns "peering through windows". South Wales Police put out a warning at the weekend after receiving complaints about people dressed as clowns "frightening others intentionally". Chf Insp Paul Staniforth of Gwent Police said: "Some of the reports have included, clowns running through gardens and peering through windows, lurking around shopping centres, parks and schools and jumping from trees. "Fortunately, to date, we've had no reports of anyone being harmed during these reports." He said people could be arrested for a public order offence - causing harassment, alarm or distress. The culprits are said to be following a trend that started in the US. Sgt Rhys Williams of Dyfed-Powys Police said while dressing up was not a criminal offence, "deliberately scaring someone, causing harassment, alarm or distress could lead to arrest". Officers were looking into some of the reports, but no arrests have been made. Sgt Williams added: "Please be mindful that what seems like a bit of fun to you, could not be seen the same way by those on the receiving end of this prank. "There is also the possibility that you could attempt to scare the wrong person and they could retaliate. "Anyone who commits a criminal offence should be aware that dressing as a clown does not make them exempt from being investigated and dealt with through the Criminal Justice System." North Wales Police said officers were aware of incidents, but no offences had been reported.	Sightings of "creepy clowns" have been reported across Wales, with police warning people they could be arrested for scaring others.
A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it "will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.	Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Generations of James Bond fans have cheered 007 as he shoots and sleeps his way through a world of sinister villains and exotic women. The image is hi-tech, violent, romantic and more than a little cynical. It's a world-beating brand, but one today's spymasters are doing their best to keep at arm's length. And so, for the first time, MI6, officially known as the Secret Intelligence Service, is taking on the Bond image on 007's home turf - the silver screen. On Monday, MI6 launches its first ever cinema advert, aimed at attracting different types of candidate. A young woman of ethnically indeterminate background is shown demonstrating people skills and emotional intelligence in a range of everyday situations. This woman, we're told, does not work for MI6. "But she could," the advert concludes. Steely-eyed, white male killers, it seems, need not apply. "There is a perception out there that we want [Bond actor] Daniel Craig, or Daniel Craig on steroids," the SIS' current head of recruitment told the Guardian. "He would not get into MI6," says the recruitment chief, identified only as Sarah. Recruiters have long worried about the pervasiveness of the image first portrayed in the pages of Ian Fleming's novels and then seared into public consciousness via the biggest movie franchise of all time. The aim of the advert is to wean the public off this grotesquely misleading stereotype. According to the accompanying press release, the advert aims "to attract people who rule themselves out of a career in MI6 based on their misconceptions about the agency." It sounds like a long shot, but those behind it seem optimistic. "The whole point," Sarah says, "is about getting people who would never, ever think of joining." "People tend to deselect themselves," adds Mark, head of HR. "We want to prevent that. We want the service to be representative, but also to draw in the capabilities of the workforce at large." It's part of a continuing drive to recruit from the widest, most diverse cross-section of society, with a particular focus on women and ethnic minorities, both still under represented in the service. Another aspect of new effort sees a return of the old "tap on the shoulder" method employed for decades, mostly in the cloisters of Oxford and Cambridge universities. But if the method will be the same, the locations will be different. "Diverse organisations," is how Mark puts it, without elaborating. Some say that the agency's elite image may be punctured by the revelation that a 2:2 degree will make you eligible. Mark says work experience in other sectors is sometimes just as important as a good degree. Other recruiting tactics display a little playfully appropriate subterfuge to seek out those with interpersonal skills and the ability to influence people. Unbranded fliers invite you to click on goodwithpeople.uk and take a series of tests. Only those who succeed in the online games find out that they have what it takes for a life in the intelligence services. This correspondent scored well on the "emotion detector", but not so well on the "human polygraph". And when it came to the "mind changer," I failed a text message exercise designed to persuade a friend to attend a surprise party. I have not been invited to join MI6. The advert will run for a month, in cinemas in London, the West Midlands and north west England, partly reflecting the sort of urban areas recruiters look to but also the fact that MI6 can't afford a nationwide release. And will it be shown in cinemas where Bond or similar spy capers are showing? Emphatically not.	Cinemagoers may think they already know what it takes to be a spy.
Barry McGivern, Scott Fryer and Troy Lacey were travelling to work at Dereham along the A47 Acle Straight, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. They jumped into cold chest-high water to free the man from the crushed car and helped to resuscitate him. Mr Lacey, 23, said: "I'm just glad we could give him a fighting chance to see his family again." The victim is in a stable but critical condition at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, police said. The men stopped when they saw what they thought was a broken-down car and some people running along the road at about 21:00 BST on Saturday. A blaring horn then alerted them to a car upside down in a dyke where they could see a man struggling inside, said Mr Fryer. The unnamed victim, believed to be in his 40s, was trapped by his seatbelt in the crushed car and had his head in water. Mr McGivern, 28, of Great Yarmouth, said he was the first to enter the "freezing cold" water which was chest-high. Mr Lacey, from Martham, said their experience as security staff helped them to keep calm and they had freed the victim as a paramedic arrived. "The car was that crushed that at one point I didn't think we would get him out, but I managed to get under his legs and get them free and Barry snapped the seatbelt," he said. "His pulse was slow so I pumped his chest a few times." Mr Fryer, also 28, a retained fire-fighter at Gorleston, then gave the victim the kiss-of-life. "I'm just pleased we were there and we could help a fellow human being who was dying in front of us," said Mr Lacey.	Three nightclub doormen have told how they helped rescue a man trapped in an upturned car in a water-filled ditch.
The Tinbergen Building, which houses the departments of zoology and experimental psychology, will be closed from Monday. A university spokesman said it was not believed there was a health risk to regular users of the building. He said asbestos was found last year, but it was not in "accessible" areas. A total of 750 staff are based in the building and it is used by 900 students. A statement said: "We do not believe there is, or has been, a health risk to regular users of the building, and more than 200 air quality readings, taken since September 2016, support this belief. "But this asbestos cannot be removed while the building is occupied, so we have decided to close the building while expert contractors carry out remedial works. "We apologise to staff and students for the inconvenience that this unprecedented situation will cause, and we will do all we can to support them so that research and teaching can continue." Prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibres can cause illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.	About 1,650 staff and students will have to move out of an Oxford University building for up to two years after asbestos was discovered.
The report was commissioned by Stormont's Department for Social Development (DSD) and the Department of the Environment (DoE). DSD had proposed an "affordable housing contribution" would apply to all developments of five homes or more. Similar schemes operate in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The departments commissioned the research from Heriot Watt University and Three Dragons Consultancy. It concluded that introducing a scheme "with a single percentage of affordable housing across Northern Ireland will not work given current market conditions". It added that a scheme could be considered for greater Belfast but that "timing, percentage target and form of provision is best left to local decision makers". That suggests that it would be decision for councils on whether to implement a scheme. Social Development Minister Lord Morrow said: "This research report will make a valuable contribution to our evidence base on this issue. "My department, along with the Department of the Environment, will now reflect on the findings and recommendations detailed in the report."	A scheme to compel private developers to contribute towards building social housing is "not realistic" for most of Northern Ireland, a report has found.
The star wore a Gary Barlow mask as he began playing Could It Be Magic on a piano at Cabot Circus shopping centre. Shoppers watching the mystery performer were astonished when he revealed his true identity and sang the hit song. The 45-year-old entertainer is known for surprising fans - in 2015 he "crashed" a number of weddings. Hundreds of people had soon gathered to watch the former X Factor judge at the city centre mall, with many posting videos and photographs of the performance on social media. As news of the concert spread, people around the UK tweeted the star to ask him to attend weddings, birthday parties - and other shopping centres. In 2015, Barlow promised to sing at the weddings of three fans - but went on to sing at more. Among them was Natalie Purkis, who was stunned when the star turned up at her wedding reception in Oxfordshire at the request of her husband Martin. Barlow later tweeted: "I'll look back fondly at 2015 as the year of the wedding crasher!"	Take That star Gary Barlow surprised shoppers in Bristol with an impromptu concert - which started with him wearing a disguise... as himself.
Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - "Hell, no" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. "She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. "And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' "And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the "conflict of the human soul" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a "fuzzy-cheeked young preacher" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. "The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book," the Rev Butts told me. "The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. "Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice." But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. "Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old," the Rev Butts says. "She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity."	It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.
The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3% in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Prices in London, which saw big rises last year, rose by 5.5%, slightly lower than the average in England of 5.6%. Overall, UK house prices increased by 5.2% in the year to the end of July. The other area to see significant price growth was Northern Ireland, up 7.4%. Property values in Northern Ireland are recovering from a massive fall during the financial crisis, and remain 42% below the peak of August 2007, the ONS figures show, Prices rose by 6.7% in the South East of England, the ONS figures show, although here - as in the East and in seven other regions - the pace of price rises has slowed. Analysts suggest that the time of double-digit price rises in London is over for now. "There is very much a ripple effect - the action has moved out from prime central London to the outskirts and those commuter areas where there is better value to be had, although not as much if prices continue to rise as they have been," said Jonathan Adams, director of central London estate agency Napier Watt. The 5.2% average price increase in the UK was down from the 5.7% rate recorded in the previous month. Prices in Scotland fell by 1.3% and were 0.7% lower in the North East of England. Excluding London and the South East of England, UK house prices increased by 4.4%. The average home cost £295,000 in England, £173,000 in Wales, £154,000 in Northern Ireland and £196,000 in Scotland. In England, the highest average price was paid in London (£525,000) and the lowest in the North East (£156,000). The average price paid in the UK was £282,000, and analysts expect this to continue to rise, not least as a result of a lack of properties in the market. Writing in the Guardian, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst for Savills, said that the cost of buying a property, rather than the cost of owning it, is the biggest barrier to people buying their first home. That is because a large amount is needed for a deposit, while mortgage costs are well below the norm. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of homeowners remortgaging - in order to take advantage of low rates - rose by 26% in July compared with the same month a year earlier.	House prices are rising fastest in the East of England, official figures show, as analysts suggest property market "action" has moved out of London.
Kent County Council said the continuing flow of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) from across the English Channel had left it with no choice. The authority currently has 924 such children in its care, compared with nearly 630 at the start of last August. Councillor Peter Oakford said it was "not a position we want to be in". The cabinet member for specialist children's services said Kent County Council had seen a 30% rise in looked-after children in the past seven months. Other authorities elsewhere in the UK have accepted full responsibility for 56 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Mr Oakford told the children's social care and health cabinet committee: "This has affected our ability to place citizen children within Kent ourselves. "We have had to place Kent children outside of Kent due to the influx of UASC, which is not a good position to be in and is not a position we want to be in. "It's actually costing us more financially because we have had to place, I think, six children into residential care either short-term or longer term, which is far more expensive than normal foster care." The council's services have been stretched since the start of the migrant crisis last summer as Kent is the closest British county to Calais and Dunkirk. The number of child asylum seekers coming into its care has slowed to about 15 a week during the winter, but Mr Oakford said if that increased with the arrival of the warmer months the authority would be "in significant difficulties".	Vulnerable children are being placed in care outside their home county of Kent due to the influx of child asylum seekers, according to council chiefs.
New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed vast numbers of the world's bees. Scientists at Paignton Zoo are researching how the breed has survived the mite. The zoo hopes its findings will help protect colonies and encourage more bee keepers to take on the Cornish breed. Colonies of the bees have been moved to the zoo to monitor their health over the summer. The mites act as tiny incubators of one deadly form of the disease, and inject it directly into the bees' blood. Michael Bungard from the zoo said: "It's important that zoos look in our own backyard. "Our bee project is predominantly education, so we can get the message across about the Cornish black bees and the varroa mite."	A rare Cornish bee species could save dwindling populations from a disease that has wiped out millions of colonies worldwide, scientists have said.
Smith, 34, lost WBO title bouts with Arthur Abraham in 2014 and 2015, and trainer Joe Gallagher said Saturday's fight was a "last roll of the dice". The Briton has now been beaten seven times in his 45 professional fights. The three judges in Wetzlar, Germany, each ruled the fight 119-108 in Zeuge's favour. It was Zeuge's third defence since he won the WBA title from Italian Gioavanni de Carolis in November 2016. In a largely one-sided contest, Smith was given a count by the referee in the closing seconds of the final round despite appearing to slip. "Is it the end at world level for him? 100%. Is there another level he wants to compete at? That is one for Paul Smith," promoter Eddie Hearn said on Sky Sports. "We talked about last-chance saloon before the fight, he left it much too late. I think he will be kicking himself for that. "He had a good spell in the third round when he wobbled Zeuge, and he did in the 11th and 12th rounds too. We would have liked to see that earlier, but it's easy for us to say. Zeuge was very good and countered well."	Paul Smith lost a third attempt to win a world title as Tyron Zeuge retained his WBA world super-middleweight belt with a unanimous points decision.
Andrew Virco, 50, and Katharine Walker, 51, from Cambridge, died with two other Britons when the aircraft crashed into a glacier on South Island, on Saturday. Ms Walker's daughter, Rebecca, 22, said the couple were on a "big adventure" that had been planned for some time. "They do holidays but this was the big one... they had waited for," she said. "New Zealand was her dream. Her and Andy had been planning it for a long time. It was what they would do for their 50th birthdays. "It was their celebration together." Ms Walker was head of radiotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Her daughter, a university student, said: "She was everything. She had a special spin on life. She worked hard and she played hard. That's the way she lived her life. "She affected so many people in so many good ways. The things she did at work were incredible. "You just walked through town and everybody would be like 'hi, hi'. I couldn't go shopping without her seeing someone she knew. Cambridge is a big place but she affected so many people. "Not having her here is just going to break so many people. It hasn't sunk in yet." She described Mr Virco, an award-winning photographer, as "amazing". "He took me into his world," she said. "He treated me like his daughter and you can't say much more than that. He's going to be missed." Nigel and Helen Charlton, aged 66 and 70, from Hampshire, also died in the crash, along with Sovannmony Leang, 27, and Josephine Gibson, 29, both from New South Wales, Australia; and pilot Mitchell Gameren, 28, from Queenstown, New Zealand. The recovery operation has been halted for the day after weather conditions at Fox Glacier deteriorated. Three bodies have been recovered. The cause of the crash is being investigated.	A couple who died in a helicopter crash in New Zealand were on a "dream" holiday to celebrate their 50th birthdays, their family has said.
A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for "atheism and espionage". During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation "God is Greatest" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith. The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society. TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening. Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far. Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios. In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark. In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead. In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants. The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests. This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas. Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to "torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them". And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank. Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case. Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor. In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake. The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared. Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was "unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame". Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden. The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month. Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue. But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals. The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat. It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations. As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: "Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective."

From shipwrecks to terror attacks to an air disaster involving Paris Hilton, it seems that almost nothing is off-limits for the prank shows that have become a staple of North African TV during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
They argue that the total volume of water in aquifers underground is 100 times the amount found on the surface. The team have produced the most detailed map yet of the scale and potential of this hidden resource. Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters , they stress that large scale drilling might not be the best way of increasing water supplies. Across Africa more than 300 million people are said not to have access to safe drinking water. Demand for water is set to grow markedly in coming decades due to population growth and the need for irrigation to grow crops. Freshwater rivers and lakes are subject to seasonal floods and droughts that can limit their availability for people and for agriculture. At present only 5% of arable land is irrigated. When water falls as rain or snow, much of it either flows into rivers or is used to provide moisture to plants and crops. What is left over trickles down to the layers of rock that sit beneath the soil. And just like a giant sponge, this ground water is held in the spaces between the rocks and in the tiny inter-connected spaces between individual grains in a rock like sandstone. These bodies of wet rock are referred to as aquifers. Ground water does not sit still in the aquifer but is pushed and pulled by gravity and the weight of water above it. The movement of the water through the aquifer removes many impurities and it is often cleaner than water on the surface. Now scientists have for the first time been able to carry out a continent-wide analysis of the water that is hidden under the surface in aquifers. Researchers from the British Geological Survey and University College London (UCL)             have mapped in detail the amount and potential yield  of this groundwater resource across the continent. Helen Bonsor from the BGS is one of the authors of the paper. She says that up until now groundwater was out of sight and out of mind. She hopes the new maps will open people's eyes to the potential. "Where there's greatest ground water storage is in northern Africa, in the large sedimentary basins, in Libya, Algeria and Chad," she said. "The amount of storage in those basins is equivalent to 75m thickness of water across that area - it's a huge amount." Due to changes in climate that have turned the Sahara into a desert over centuries many of the aquifers underneath were last filled with water over 5,000 years ago. The scientists collated their information from existing hydro-geological maps from national governments as well as 283 aquifer studies. The researchers say their new maps indicate that many countries currently designated as "water scarce" have substantial groundwater reserves. However, the scientists are cautious about the best way of accessing these hidden resources. They suggest that widespread drilling of large boreholes might not work. Dr Alan MacDonald of the BGS, lead author of the study, told the BBC: "High-yielding boreholes should not be developed without a thorough understanding of the local groundwater conditions. "Appropriately sited and developed boreholes for low yielding rural water supply and hand pumps are likely to be successful." With many aquifers not being filled due to a lack of rain, the scientists are worried that large-scale borehole developments could rapidly deplete the resource. According to Helen Bonsor, sometimes the slower means of extraction can be more efficient. "Much lower storage aquifers are present across much of sub-Saharan Africa," she explained. "However, our work shows that with careful exploring and construction, there is sufficient groundwater under Africa to support low yielding water supplies for drinking and community irrigation." The scientists say that there are sufficient reserves to be able to cope with the vagaries of climate change. "Even in the lowest storage aquifers in semi arid areas with currently very little rainfall, ground water is indicated to have a residence time in the ground of 20 to 70 years." Dr Bonsor said. "So at present extraction rates for drinking and small scale irrigation for agriculture groundwater will provide and will continue to provide a buffer to climate variability." The publication of the new map was welcomed by the UK's secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell. "This is an important discovery," he said. "This research, which the British Government has funded, could have a profound effect on some of the world's poorest people, helping them become less vulnerable to drought and to adapt to the impact of climate change."	Scientists say the notoriously dry continent of Africa is sitting on a vast reservoir of groundwater.
Greater Manchester Police spoke to the 42-year-old in Failsworth on Saturday after an abandoned 999 call. The woman had minor facial injuries and a 57-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault. Police later returned to the property in Oldham Road to take a statement from the woman but found her dead. A post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was "not suspicious", a Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said. A mandatory referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was made because police had been in touch with the woman prior to her death. Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "First and foremost I would like to express our most sincere condolences to the woman's family for their tragic loss. "In line with our usual policy when an incident such as this occurs, we have made referral to the IPCC and we await their decision on whether or not they wish to investigate." He added: "In the meantime, we are continuing to investigating the circumstances surrounding the initial call that was made to police which prompted officers to attend and arrest a 57-year-old man on suspicion of assault."	A police force has referred itself to the watchdog over the death of a woman hours after she spoke to officers about an alleged assault.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 18-year-old, who is from Blackwood, took home gold at Saturday's German Open in Hamburg, Germany. Williams performend well and won the -67kg division taking an impressive 112 points from just four fights. "At the Euros nobody really expected me to medal. I just tried my best but now there's added pressure to perform," Williams told BBC Wales Sport. "The German Open was vital for me as I needed points to go to the Grand Prix. Winning gold really was a big bonus. "I've medalled consistently at competitions. I feel I have to maintain that reputation and keep medalling at these competitions but I try to not think about it too much and put my best into everything. "The high scorings make it more exciting. Being able to pull off matches with high scores is a massive bonus as it shows the kicks I'm throwing are working and it's given me confidence to throw high-scoring kicks." Williams first considered taking up taekwondo after watching fellow Welsh fighter Jade Jones win gold at London 2012. She now trains alongside Jones with the British squad in Manchester and says the double Olympic champion is a great inspiration. "It's amazing to train with Jade herself. Jade and Bianca [Walkden] are both Olympic medallists," Williams continued. "To be able to train with them everyday and really push myself gives me great confidence that when I do go out into the ring and fight, they're not going to be much better than Jade and Bianca, so it's a massive confidence boost "My next big aim is the senior World Championships. I'm hoping to be selected for that. If I can medal at that competition it will put me in a really good place and make qualifying for the Olympics a bit more accomplishable."	European Taekwondo champion Lauren Williams says she feels under pressure to keep up her winning record.
LL Camps in Bushey, Hertfordshire, was closed by Ofsted last week and director Ben Lewis has been charged with possessing indecent images of children. Following the closure, parents vented their anger on the firm's Facebook page at the initial lack of information. But camp co-founder Tal Landsman has now said refunds will be issued. Ofsted closed the camp on 6 August and the company's website was taken down soon after. One parent whose child was due to attend the US-style day camp wrote it was an "utter disgrace". Another was concerned about parents who "could not afford alternative care without the refund". A man whose children had gone to the camp told the BBC: "Fortunately, for us they were only going for one further day, and then they were going to a different camp. "Had it been the situation that they were due to be there this week and all of next week, we'd be in a bit of bother." But on Wednesday, Mr Landsman confirmed parents would be able to fill in a refund form which has been placed on a holding page on the company's official website. Mr Lewis and Mr Landsman opened the holiday club in 2010.	Parents of children due to go to a summer camp whose director has been charged with possession of indecent images have been offered refunds.
Councillors have discussed plans aimed at improving the city's transport network and changing its image as what a report calls a "motorway city". City Square could be closed off to through traffic by 2021, as could Neville Street that runs past Bridgewater Place into the city centre. The move forms part of the city's 2023 European Capital of Culture bid. The plan was to get more people cycling and walking around the city, the report said. Cycles, buses and taxis would still be allowed in City Square that lies close to the railway station. Councillor Richard Lewis said: "It's about how me make the city both liveable and prosperous in the future." An upgrade of Armley Gyratory, one of the busiest junctions in the city, was also in the council's plans, he said. There were still many details to be worked out and there would be feasibility studies and consultations, Mr Lewis added. The plans are part of a discussion on a 20-year vision for the city. The HS2 high-speed rail network is planned to stop at a new city centre station in Leeds by 2032/33. The council must register its capital of culture interest by December 2016 and submit a final bid in 2017. The winning bid is expected to be announced in 2018.	Parts of Leeds city centre could be closed to traffic in a bid to make the city less "road heavy".
The images of Europe taken from the International Space Station (ISS) have notched up tens of thousands of reactions on Facebook. Belgium can be seen glowing more brightly than its neighbours. The country's dense road network enjoys near-total streetlight coverage, with lights kept on throughout the night. It uses about 2.2 million bulbs to illuminate Belgium's roads - with 186 bulbs per square mile, the New York Times reports. The 39-year-old French astronaut posted an image on Twitter showing the Aurora Borealis - also known as the Northern Lights - visible towards the north of the globe, and also noted that Belgium "stands out as usual". In another, on his Facebook page, he said London, Paris and Brussels "form a very European triangle". The photos are taken from the "cupola" - a module of the ISS built by the European Space Agency. In his blog, Mr Pesquet says he likes to look out on the Earth while working out on an exercise machine positioned there. "There are not a lot of gyms with such a view!" he writes. He describes in detail life on board the space station, explaining - among other things - that tortillas are better than bread in space, as they don't leave crumbs to plague the astronauts in their weightless environment. Most social media responses to the images marvelled at the beauty of the Earth viewed at night from some 400km (248 miles) above. But some complained about the wasted power and light pollution: "We can see very well the glitz and wasted electricity! Awful for lovers of the sky!" wrote Christian Cellier on Facebook. And one user, Michel-L Saucy said, was more concerned about extra-terrestrial visitors: "Hope that the aliens are not too attracted to light... We cannot accommodate them all once!"	Belgium's penchant for extravagant motorway lighting is suddenly in the spotlight thanks to pictures posted by French astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
Media playback is not supported on this device Stokes, 25, was ruled out of the 2014 World Twenty20 after punching a dressing room locker in Barbados. He was hit for four sixes in the last over of last year's World Twenty20 final as West Indies won the title. "I'll still have that same desire and hunger and want to get into people's faces," he told Test Match Special. Stokes was named vice-captain of the Test team under Joe Root last month, after deputising during England's one-day tour of Bangladesh in October. "I like to think I've grown. I think that's just from playing more and getting a few demerit points and a few tellings-off after games," he said. But the Durham man, who famously clashed with Marlon Samuels during England's Test tour of the West Indies in 2015, and again during the World T20 final, added: "That's what makes me the cricketer I am and I don't want to lose that. "I'm probably going to have to take maybe a step back a few times." Stokes is playing in his first series since he became the Indian Premier League's most expensive foreign player in February. He was the subject of a bidding war between five IPL sides before Rising Pune Supergiants bought him for £1.7m. Stokes says his England team-mates have joked about the fee paid for him. "I found it tough to talk about but the group that we have, it's funny to be around them because it's just taking the mickey out of everyone," Stokes said. "Everyone gets brought back down to earth. It's just the way we operate, which is why it's such a good environment to be in at the moment." England have won nine of their past 10 ODIs against West Indies and secured a 25-run victory when the two sides last met at the same venue in 2014. West Indies are ranked ninth in the world in 50-over cricket, a standing that denied them a place in this year's Champions Trophy, and will field an inexperienced side after changes to national selection. Players can only appear for the international side in limited-overs cricket if they have played the relevant format domestically in the Caribbean since 2010. "We can't be going into this game thinking it's just going to be a walk in the park," Stokes added. "We know how talented the West Indies team are - their batsmen can hit the ball out of the ground whenever they choose to and they've always had good quick bowlers." England captain Eoin Morgan confirmed that fast bowler Steven Finn will start Friday's match in place of Jake Ball, who suffered a knee injury in a warm-up game on Monday in St Kitts, and ahead of recent call-up Tom Curran. Sam Billings is also expected to open the batting alongside Jason Roy, with Alex Hales not yet match-fit despite joining up with the squad after recovering from a hand fracture. Morgan said his side "have one eye on the Champions Trophy" on home soil in June but added that West Indies could prove as tough a challenge as the  2-1 series loss in India in January. "The way we play, aggressively and positively, isn't the easiest to adapt to West Indies conditions with slow, turning wickets," he said. "The wickets here will be more challenging here than in India - those wickets were a lot more batter-friendly than we thought they were going to be." England probable XI: Sam Billings, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn.	England all-rounder Ben Stokes says he has grown up as his side prepare to start their one-day series against West Indies in Antigua on Friday.
People started fastening the padlocks to cables on St Botolph's Bridge, Boston, in Lincolnshire, after it opened in 2014. The locks supposedly symbolise the everlasting bond between two lovers. In recent years, the trend has spread across many parts of the UK - with bridges in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire targeted. Lincolnshire County Council said it had to remove the locks because they could potentially damage the stainless steel cables. A spokesperson for the authority said: "Unfortunately, some are starting to rust and it has become necessary to take them off to prevent further damage. The trend has met with some criticism, with the No Love Locks campaign calling it "an epidemic". One local woman also questioned whether the town was an appropriate place for such acts of love. She told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: "I'm not sure Boston would be the romance centre of the UK." The locks are being removed exactly a year after the bridge over the River Haven opened. They will be kept at Boston Borough Council's headquarters in the town for 21 days if anyone wants to claim them back.	Love locks on a new river footbridge are being removed because of fears they are damaging the structure.
Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers," the regulators said. "These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers." No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was "misguided" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the "unforeseeable" effects of the financial crisis.	Regulators are to begin investigations into senior managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis.
The 30-year-old midfielder moved to McDiarmid Park for a second spell in February 2016 after a frustrating five months with Hearts. He has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances since then, having netted twice while on loan in 2015. "The pull of Hibernian was too much for me," said Swanson. "It's always been an ambition of mine to play for the club and I am looking forward to this new challenge and to help achieve their goals back in the Premiership." The Championship winners are yet to reveal details of the contract agreed with the former Dundee United, Peterborough and Coventry City player. Saints offered the midfielder new terms, with Swanson adding: "The decision to leave St Johnstone has been a difficult one for me. I've felt settled at the Saints and really enjoyed my football, and my period at the club has been the most enjoyable and satisfying time of my career. "So, it goes without saying, my decision to leave McDiarmid Park was not taken lightly. "I want to thank the manager, Tommy Wright, who has supported me in so many ways, on and off the field. "His trust in me on the football park allowed me to flourish. The way he treated me like an adult off the park also helped me to mature and develop as a person. "Now that we are in the top six yet again, which is yet another fine achievement, for the next five games it's my focus to make sure I play my part in helping St Johnstone qualify for a European place." Saints are currently fourth in the top flight, five points ahead of Hearts in the race for the final Europa League spot. Asked what Swanson would bring to his Hibs team, head coach Neil Lennon told his club website: "Goals from midfield, hopefully, creativity, "He's had a great season, into double figures. "I think he sees a pass, he's a fit lad, he crosses the ball well. And, whenever I have seen him play for St Johnstone, he has probably been their best player and more likely to create something. "And, allied to that, he is a Leith boy. He gets the club and that's always important as well." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Danny Swanson has confirmed that he is leaving St Johnstone to join Hibernian, saying he could not resist the lure of his boyhood favourites.
The barrister turned politician led the Home Office at the time of the poll tax riots and the Strangeways prison disturbances in the spring of 1990. On the right of the party, he entered Parliament in a by-election in the 1960s and served as chief whip and other roles under Margaret Thatcher. After leaving the House of Commons, he served as leader of the House of Lords and latterly as governor of Bermuda. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to Lord Waddington's "long and distinguished career in public service", saying he would be sadly missed. "He combined the sharp intelligence of a Queen's Counsel with the wit of a proud Lancastrian," she said. The Oxford-educated David Waddington served in the army in the 1950s before going into politics and first being elected to Parliament in 1968. He represented a number of different seats in Lancashire between 1968 and 1974, when he lost his seat, and again between 1979 and 1990. After rising through the ministerial ranks, he became chief whip - in charge of party discipline - before succeeding Lord Hurd as home secretary in October 1989. A supporter of capital punishment, he took a tougher line on law and order issues than his predecessor, piloting legislation through the Commons in 1990 to ensure serious criminals served longer sentences. He stood down after John Major became prime minister in November 1990 and accepted a peerage soon afterwards. He retired from the House of Lords in 2015.	Former Conservative Home Secretary Lord Waddington has died at the age of 87.
The Euro 2016 semi-finalists initially faced spirited Moldovan resistance but led 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Sam Vokes and Joe Allen. Gareth Bale seized on a woeful pass for the third, then netted a last-minute penalty for his second of the night. Wales' win puts them top of Group D on goal difference ahead of Austria. Chris Coleman's men travel to Vienna for their next World Cup qualifier on Thursday, 6 October. As the group's top seeds, Coleman's side had been expected to make light work of Moldova, who are ranked 154 places below them in the world rankings. After a cagey first half hour they eventually did so with a flourish, becoming the first team to score three or more goals against the eastern European minnows since England's 4-0 victory in 2013. Having led Wales to a first major tournament semi-final at Euro 2016, Coleman said he was "desperate" to follow that achievement by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The former Fulham manager and his players want to ensure their summer exploits in France were not a one-off but a springboard to sustained success. They were backed by a typically vociferous Cardiff City Stadium crowd of 31,731, close to capacity once again as a nation basks in its greatest footballing era. And although it came against limited opposition, this opening victory was an encouraging start as Wales aim to end an absence from World Cups that stretches back to 1958. "That was the perfect start," former Wales international John Hartson said on Radio 5 live. "Moldova were awful, it was a comfortable win as you will see and great start to the qualifying campaign." There was a familiarity to Wales' initial inability to break Moldova down; struggling to unlock a deep and tenacious defence as they had done against Andorra and Israel during their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Moldova had lost 14 of their past 20 games but they are seldom pushovers and have conceded only 26 goals in the process. However, Wales' domination of possession and territory eventually paid dividends after 38 minutes when Bale's arcing cross was headed in by Vokes. Five minutes later, a weak attempted clearance from Moldova goalkeeper Ilie Cebanu found its way to Allen, who scored his first goal for Wales with a drilled half-volley from the edge of the penalty area. Bale claimed Wales' third goal in comical circumstances, as he latched on to a terrible backpass from Moldova's Ion Jardan before clipping the ball neatly beyond Cebanu. The Real Madrid forward scored his second in added time, converting a penalty after he had been brought down to move within four goals of Ian Rush's Welsh record of 28. Wales' next fixture could be the toughest of their qualifying campaign, away against Group D second seeds Austria on 6 October. Austria won 2-1 in Georgia on Monday and, with Serbia and the Republic of Ireland drawing 2-2 in Belgrade, this group is expected to be wide open. Sterner challenges await Coleman's side but this victory - their biggest winning margin in a competitive game since 2003 - will lift hopes of qualifying for a first World Cup in 60 years.

The Fraser of Allander Institute reckons that growth this year will be 1.9%, the same as its forecast for last year, for which official data has not been finalised. That is a reduction on the 2.2% forecast for 2016 that it published in November. For 2017, the forecast has fallen from 2.5% to 2.2% in those past four months. The economists at the Strathclyde University institute warned that growth was too dependent on household spending based on credit, which they said was unsustainable. They explained that the benefits of cheaper oil had not fed through to the economy as strongly as the harm it had done to the energy sector itself. The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans. The economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations. Prof Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer. The report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000. The report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June. It claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment. Its analysis of the European choice was that "it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU". It noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets. The Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak. The latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly. However, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally. It said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt. Paul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: "The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence." He suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers. At sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels. The production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.	Growth in the Scottish economy is failing to pick up pace, according to one of Scotland's main forecasters.
The 42-year-old man was discovered in wetland at the Medmerry Nature Reserve, in Earnley, on Tuesday by Coastguards. Sussex Police said the incident, which took place in the Selsey area at about 17:00 GMT, was being treated as a "tragic accident". The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and British Hang Gliding Association have been informed. A spokesman for Sussex Police said they believed the AAIB would be "leading on the investigation into the cause of the crash".	A hang gliding pilot has died in an accident at a nature reserve near Chichester in West Sussex.
He told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, that he had heard "more and more" that the contest would be unfair. He offered no immediate evidence. At another event he called Democratic rival Hillary Clinton "the devil". Mr Trump has come under fire from across the political divide for remarks he made about the parents of a US Muslim soldier killed in action. On the forthcoming vote, he told supporters "I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest". He later repeated the claim on Fox News, adding "I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.". Mr Trump has made similar comments before in relation to the Democratic race, suggesting the party fixed its system to favour nominee Hillary Clinton over her challenger Bernie Sanders. Earlier this year, he also complained the Republican primary system was also "rigged" amid party efforts to stop his march to the candidacy. Correspondents say Mr Trump could be trying to capitalise on voters' distrust of establishment institutions, or lay the groundwork should he lose the election. At another rally in Pennsylvania, he took the unprecedented step of directly calling Mrs Clinton "the devil". He attacked Mr Sanders for capitulating in the Democratic race, saying he "made a deal with the devil. She's the devil." Democrats and Republicans alike have condemned Mr Trump for his remarks about the parents of US Army Capt Humayun Khan, who was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in Iraq, at the age of 27. Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain became the latest senior figure in the party to criticise Mr Trump for his attacks. Senator McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam War, said in a strongly worded statement that Mr Trump did not have "unfettered licence to defame the best among us". The soldier's parents, Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala, told the BBC it was time to stand up to Mr Trump but he accused them of "viciously" attacking him. Mr Trump had caused controversy by suggesting Ghazala Khan had been prevented from speaking alongside her husband at the Democratic convention last week. In another development, American billionaire businessman Warren Buffett challenged Mr Trump to release his tax returns. Mr Trump has said that they cannot be made public until the financial authorities have completed an audit. But Mr Buffett said there were no rules against showing tax returns and allowing people to ask questions about them.	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested that the November election could be "rigged".
The West Ham striker is charged with driving a car while a baby was being held by a passenger. Snodgrass, 29, is alleged to have driven on Duke Street, Glasgow, on 17 April with too many people to fit a baby seat in. The baby is alleged to have been in the arms for a rear seat passenger. Snodgrass, originally from Glasgow, was not at the city's Justice of the Peace Court when the case called. Defence lawyer Martin Black told the court "he didn't think he had to be" when asked why his client was not present. The Crown requested a warrant which was granted by JP Eunice Paton.	A warrant has been issued for Scotland international footballer Robert Snodgrass after he failed to turn up for his court trial.
Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over £600m in 2014 to only £55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from £500m in 2014 to £30m in 2016. Knight Frank said the low oil price "continued to take its toll" in the north east, with few deals going through in 2016. But it added that market conditions could improve in the year ahead, with crude prices making a recovery. The report found investors spent nearly £1.8bn last year across all sectors in Scotland, including offices, hotels, shops, student accommodation and industrial units. The figure was 12% down on the previous year but above the 10-year average of £1.72bn. Edinburgh registered a particularly strong year for investment, with almost £1.2bn transacted across all sectors - 92.5% up on 2015. But Glasgow saw a "more muted" 12 months, with transaction volumes down by 59% at £280m. Alasdair Steele, from Knight Frank, said: "Overall, the Scottish commercial property market remained resilient, despite an unstable 12 months. "Across the country, political uncertainty has influenced investment levels over the last year. "However, there's a general feeling beginning to emerge that Scotland offers good value and strong fundamentals - an attractive proposition for investors seeking solid returns at an especially turbulent time. "We'd hope to see that reflected in transaction volumes picking up in 2017, provided the political climate remains stable." Meanwhile, a separate report has suggested that investor interest in Scotland's commercial property market has failed to pick up despite an increase in occupier demand. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said both domestic and foreign investment inquiries stayed in negative territory in the last quarter. At the same time, the supply of property for investment purposes fell across all sectors. Some surveyors described market conditions as "challenging". The latest Rics UK commercial market survey suggested increased demand from occupiers in the office and industrial sectors. But it was a different story for retail in the fourth quarter, with a net balance of 14% more chartered surveyors reporting a fall in demand for retail space. Gavin Anderson, from Montagu Evans in Glasgow, said: "The current economic outlook isn't looking great and consumer spending on the high street is feeling the effect of growing fears about the economy. "Hopefully, the anticipated reduction in the rateable value of retail premises from April 2017 will act as a catalyst to help retailers' profit margins across their shop portfolios and increase their confidence to expand and take more stores next year." Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: "The results for the survey suggest that the commercial property market in Scotland has failed to attract investor interest despite an increase in occupier demand for commercial property in the last quarter. "This may be due, in part, to the prospects for the economy and the political situation more generally."	Investment in commercial property has plummeted in Aberdeen in the last two years, according to a report by a consultancy.
Former MEP turned AM Eluned Morgan spoke a year on from the referendum when Wales voted to leave the EU. Hard and soft Brexit relates to the type of relationship with the EU single market after the UK leaves the bloc. UKIP MEP Nathan Gill warned against a "con" of a Brexit, saying there were only two options - to leave or to stay. Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said his family faced "abuse" after he decided to campaign for Leave. On June 23 2016, 854,572 people in Wales - 52.5% of those who took part in the referendum - voted for Brexit, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) who said the UK should stay. The figures were in line with the UK result and came despite First Minister Carwyn Jones and the then Prime Minister David Cameron campaigning for a Remain vote. Asked how parties that campaigned for Remain should learn from the referendum, Ms Morgan said: "We should probably stop talking about the EU in terms that people don't understand. "Not many people I know understand hard and soft Brexit, and those are the experts. "If we really want to connect with the people we have to start talking about a jobs Brexit, or a Brexit that means you can still go out to a cafe and be served because actually we [could] lose so many people." Soft Brexit is sometimes used to refer to the UK maintaining some kind of relationship with the single market in return for concessions on freedom of movement, while hard or clean Brexit suggests leaving the single market entirely. There is no agreed definition of either. But Mr Gill, former UKIP Wales leader, told BBC Wales: "There's only one type of Brexit - you leave or you stay." He says Britain has to leave the single market and the customs union "otherwise we haven't left - it has to be that way". "We have to give the public some credit. They understood these things," Mr Gill said. He suggested that anything else would be a "con". Andrew RT Davies- another leading Brexit campaigner - told BBC Wales last year he suffered "brutal" treatment from senior Tory party figures after he announced his preference for leaving the EU. In an interview he said said his family "received quite a bit of abuse around the decision that I took".	A prominent Welsh Labour EU supporter has said the public largely do not understand what is meant by the terms "soft" or "hard" Brexit.
Board members are believed to have wanted bigger cost cuts and more focus on the investment bank's performance. Chairman John McFarlane said the bank needed to become more efficient: "What we need is profit improvement. Barclays is not efficient. We are cumbersome." In a statement, Barclays said a "new set of skills" was required at the top. Mr Jenkins has been Barclays' chief executive since 2012. The bank said a search for his successor was under way. Barclays' chairman John McFarlane has been named executive chairman until a new chief executive is appointed. In a conference call, Mr McFarlane said the board had decided the firm needed to change its strategy in order to boost revenue growth. Barclays needs to be "leaner and more agile" to improve the firm's capital performance, he said. Investors welcomed the news of the change, sending shares in Barclays up more than 2% in London. Mr McFarlane applauded Mr Jenkins' role in steering Barclays through the aftermath of the financial crisis, and through the fallout of Barclays' management shakeup three years ago. But he also said: "There is no question that cultural change was urgently required." Mr McFarlane told BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed that Mr Jenkins' skill set had been suitable when he took the top post, but that the firm's needs had changed. When the BBC asked him about future job cuts, he did not rule them out. Nor did he rule out the possibility of branch closures. "Inevitably, banks are going to have fewer branches than they have now," Mr McFarlane said. He also told the BBC that Barclays would not renew its sponsorship of the Premier League when it expires later this year. Make no mistake, Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, has been fired after falling out with the board over the size of the investment bank and the pace of cost cutting. Mr Jenkins, who became chief executive in 2012, was told in the last few days that the board no longer had confidence that he was the right man to lead the organisation. Senior sources have told me that Sir Mike Rake, the deputy chairman of Barclays, approached the new chairman, John McFarlane, to say that a number of board members were unhappy with the speed of change at the bank. They wanted cost cutting to go further and more attention paid to the investment bank which is seen as under-performing. It is thought that Sir Mike wants Barclays to retain its global presence as a major investment bank whilst Mr Jenkins felt it should be cut back. It has been made clear to me that Mr Jenkins was seen as having done a good job steadying the bank after the previous chief executive, Bob Diamond, resigned. But it is now time for a new person at the top. Whilst that search continues, Mr McFarlane will become chairman and chief executive, a similar role to the one he held at the insurance giant Aviva. In Barclays' statement, Mr McFarlane said the bank needed to boost returns to shareholders. "We therefore need to improve revenue, costs and capital performance." The board said it recognised the contribution Mr Jenkins had made over the past three years, and was "extremely grateful to him for bringing the company to a much stronger position". But the bank said its non-executive directors had "concluded that new leadership is required to accelerate the pace of execution going forward". Mr Jenkins took over at Barclays in the summer of 2012 following the departure of Bob Diamond, who left in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank said Mr Jenkins had inherited a situation which "would have challenged anyone facing the same issues". Mr Jenkins said that when he had taken over as group chief executive in 2012 it was a "particularly difficult time for Barclays". "It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us.  I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then," he said.	Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, has been fired after falling out with the board over the bank's cost cutting and profitability.
The 21-year-old, who has also played on the wing, has progressed through Wigan's youth system. Tierney is the son of former England dual-code international Jason Robinson, who also played for the Warriors. "It is a huge achievement for me to agree this contract extension and I'm very happy to be staying at my hometown club," said Tierney. His new deal also includes the option of a further year. "Lewis is a good young Wigan kid who knows what it means to play for this great club," added head coach Shaun Wane. "He has improved a greatly in the last few years and it excites me that there is still a lot more improvement to come."	Wigan Warriors full-back Lewis Tierney has signed a new three-year deal with the Super League side until 2019.
Councils in England, including Bradford and Birmingham, will trial the pilot scheme at local elections in 2018. The government said it would "ensure the integrity" of the electoral system. But campaigners said levels of fraud did not justify the move and one Labour MP said it would hit poorer voters. A full list of the participating councils has not yet been drawn up, but 18 council areas in England identified by the Electoral Commission as being most susceptible to voter fraud will be invited to take part in the pilot. The 18 also include Luton, Slough, Woking, Coventry and Bristol. Different local authorities will trial different types of ID, including driving licences, passports and utility bills. The creation of a new form of ID specifically for voting has been ruled out by ministers. Northern Ireland already requires voters to show ID before casting their vote. Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said fraud of any kind was unacceptable and dismissed suggestions that the plans, which could be rolled out across the whole country if successful, could disenfranchise poor people who do not have ID. He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "Voting is one of the most important transactions you can make as an individual. In many transactions you need a proof of ID." "I'm determined to ensure, when it comes to groups who are under-registered, that they get the opportunity to exercise their vote," he added. "Ensuring those communities are protected, that the risks of electoral fraud are diminished, will ensure those individuals are represented fairly across this country." The reform was first touted by former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles in August, when he released recommendations amid growing concerns about electoral fraud. He tweeted that the government was "right to give greater powers to electoral officials and the police to deal with intimidation and other unwanted behaviour". In his report, Sir Eric cited research suggesting certain Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities could be more vulnerable to fraud due to a lack of understanding of the voting process. He highlighted "kinship" traditions, saying they emphasised collective over individual rights and made it more likely that people would "hand over" their vote over to others. Mr Skidmore dismissed suggestions the new measures were targeted at any "particular community" but said it was essential people across the UK were able to fulfil their democratic rights "regardless of their race or their religion". The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for changes to the electoral system to make it "fairer", said the move was a "blunt instrument" that could deter people from voting. "While we should take all instances of voter fraud very seriously where they occur, mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut," chief executive Katie Ghose said. "The government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting. "There is simply no evidence to suggest that electoral fraud is widespread across the UK. Where it has occurred it has been isolated and should be tackled locally." Labour said it supported the idea in principle but views varied among its MPs with Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, suggesting it was a "retrograde step" that was "more about combating low income voting" than tackling fraud. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said he didn't have an issue with the idea as "most people carry ID". Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who was suspended from the Labour Party and is currently an independent, said it was a "political" move and would make life more difficult for most people because of a handful of crimes. "The real problem is the people most likely not to have a passport or a driving licence are going to be the poorest and that I suspect will basically hit the Labour Party," he told Today. As well as the trials, election officials and police will be given new powers to tackle intimidation of voters by activists, who will also be banned from collecting postal votes for submission - a practice known as "harvesting". The government said it was considering plans to check the nationality of voters to stop fraudulent registrations. There will also be reforms to improve the security of the postal ballot system, including requiring postal voters to re-apply every three years.	Plans to demand proof of identity before voting in a bid to combat electoral fraud have been defended by ministers, amid criticism the move is a "sledgehammer to crack a nut".
After a dreadful first-half showing, Spurs improved and the Wales left-back found the breakthrough against their Championship opponents with a deft header. Son Heung-min then wrapped up the victory when he converted Moussa Sissoko's pass to put Mauricio Pochettino's side in Monday's fourth-round draw. Tottenham have moved into third place in the Premier League on the back of a five-match winning run, but their second string struggled to click against a Villa side set out to frustrate. Without the rested Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen, the hosts were short of ideas and the tie looked destined for a replay until unlikely goalscorer Davies arrived inside the penalty area. Villa mustered one shot on target all game and Steve Bruce will now turn his attention to overhauling a seven-point gap to the Championship play-off places. Tottenham were excellent in beating Premier League leaders Chelsea 2-0 in midweek, but perhaps unsurprisingly were nowhere near that level in the opening hour. Of the XI who started against Chelsea, only Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier kept their places - and it showed. Alli, Kane and Eriksen had contributed 30 of Spurs' 51 goals this season, and 11 of 33 assists, before kick-off and without them Pochettino's side looked toothless. Stand-in striker Vincent Janssen, who has scored just three penalties in 23 appearances now, was particularly lightweight and it was only when Alli finally replaced him after an hour that Tottenham found a way through. It was another replacement, Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who crossed for Davies to head home before Son - who had moved up front once Janssen went off - buried the second. A top-four finish remains Pochettino's most pressing assignment, but after a dismal Champions League campaign a first FA Cup win since 1991 should also be high on his list. More to follow.

The body of Peter Wrighton, 83, was found three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk on 5 August. He had been repeatedly stabbed. Norfolk Police said they wanted to trace three men seen around the woodland close to the time he died. The force said a man in his 50s seen changing into a t-shirt has been found. Police say they still want to speak to two other men; one aged 25 to 30, with tanned skin, wearing a grey or blue t-shirt, grey gym shorts and heavy-duty flip flops; the other aged 30 to 50, wearing dark clothing and seen walking without a dog to the north of the heath. Det Supt Andy Smith added: "We have already heard from more than 220 people but we will be exploring all avenues in our enquiries and we are still keen to hear from more. "We also want to hear from delivery drivers who might have travelled through or have been in the area on Saturday and who could have important dash cam footage for us to review. In addition, anyone else with images or footages of the area should contact us." There have been no arrests and no weapon has been found. Mr Wrighton was pictured on CCTV using the post office in Kenninghall at 10:10 BST, about 35 minutes before his body was found near to Fiveways Junction. "His car, a red Skoda Fabia, was parked close to The Street, the road close to the heath land where he was walking his dogs Dylan and Gemma," Det Supt Smith said. The force said it has more than 100 officers and staff working on the "significant murder investigation".	One of three "vital" potential witnesses to the murder of an elderly dog walker in woodland has been traced, police have said.
Adrian Bayley was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for killing Jill Meagher, an ABC Radio employee. On Thursday, it was announced he had been found guilty of three more rapes, of a Dutch tourist and two sex workers. The three trials were the subject of a suppression order to ensure fairness, but this was lifted after a verdict was returned in the third trial. Bayley was described by a judge in 2013 as a "recidivist sex offender". He was on parole for previous rape convictions when he killed Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher, originally from County Louth, was attacked in Melbourne in September 2012 as she walked home. Her body was discovered six days later buried on the outskirts of the city. The new convictions relate to two attacks in 2012 and one in 2000. All the women came forward after recognising Bayley during the investigation and subsequent court proceedings over the killing of Ms Meagher. The defence argued that the women had wrongly identified Bayley because of his prominence in the media, but juries in three separate trials disagreed.	An Australian man jailed for the rape and murder of an Irish woman has been convicted of three more rapes.
3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy additional homes. China's central bank has tried to clamp down on rising prices but that has done little to allay the woes of young workers who earn low wages. The BBC's Stephen McDonell reports on one of the world's most unaffordable property markets.	If you're young, Chinese and living in Beijing, you're probably locked out of the property market.
Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Wednesday. Kirsty Williams has been a member of the Welsh Assembly since it was created in 1999 - at 28, she was one of the youngest AMs elected. After the 2007 election, she successfully opposed her party entering into a so-called rainbow coalition with the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay. The episode caused divisions in the party - which she ended up leading some 18 months later. Early on in her leadership Ms Williams launched Project 31 - a plan which would see the Welsh Liberal Democrats aim to win a majority of seats in Cardiff Bay. However, in her only assembly election campaign in charge so far - 2011 - the Lib Dems lost one of their six seats, and polls suggest they have a fight to keep the rest this time around. Despite leading the smallest party in the assembly, Ms Williams can take credit for getting Welsh Labour ministers to deliver Lib Dem policies such as increased school funding for poorer pupils as part of a deal to support the government's budget. Her reputation as a party leader may be enhanced - but the biggest challenge for Kirsty Williams is making sure that there are enough Lib Dem AMs re-elected to ensure that she has a party group to lead for the next five years. Thursday 14 April - Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Aberystwyth Friday 15 April - Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones in Llangollen Monday 11 April - Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in Swansea Tuesday 12 April - UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill in Swansea Ask the Leader can be seen on BBC One Wales at 19:00 each day and on the BBC iPlayer.

Spireites midfielder Gary Liddle was sent off after only 16 minutes for a foul on Kane Vincent-Young. Chesterfield kept the U's out until Drew Wright broke free with 20 minutes remaining, cutting the ball back for Bonne to strike right-footed. However, three minutes later Lee Novak converted from the spot after he was felled by Richard Brindley. Colchester's winless run in League One stretched to 17 matches as they remain rooted to the foot of the table while a point was enough to take Chesterfield out of the relegation places.	Macauley Bonne scored his first goal in 11 games but Colchester were held to a draw by 10-man Chesterfield.
But the Taliban has been regaining ground in Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. Why is this part of Helmand so important to both sides? Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC late on Monday that the district administrative office had been abandoned by government forces. But Taliban fighters are cautious about entering it, he said. The Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied, as they have done in the Musa Qala and Nowzad regions of Helmand - where 90% of the districts are said to be under Taliban control but the centres are with the government forces. The Taliban intentionally avoids centres of the districts, where they can easily be targeted. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin would not be easy for the militants, but they may have an advantage among the local population. Many locals are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year which they say wrought unwarranted destruction to homes, farms, and other property. The Taliban will probably seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible, as they did in Kunduz where fighters could be seen posing for photos with civilians. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. It should deploy troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in 90s, soldiers who are not trying to settle old scores. Above all, it should do all it can to avoid perpetuating a cycle of violence in which the biggest victims are the local civilians.	Sangin was once the centre of operations for international forces in Afghanistan, a key district that linked Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, to the province's northern districts.
Rebel fighters have agreed a ceasefire and will leave Homs to President Bashar al-Assad's tender mercies. Yet in just a few weeks' time - by the New Year at the latest - President Assad is meant to be talking peace with some of the leaders who have suffered this reverse. It doesn't seem very likely - not with Russian President Vladimir Putin behind him. For its part, the fractured and disparate opposition wants President Assad not across the table but at least out of power and, better still, dead. Like some sick version of a knockout league, the opposition is arguing, and in some cases fighting, among themselves about who should play-off against President Assad. There is a conference in Saudi Arabia designed to sort this out. But some significant players are absent. The Kurds aren't there, despite being, by most accounts, the most effective and efficient fighting force. The jihadists aren't welcome, of course. The Western priority is to crush so-called Islamic State (IS) before there can be serious progress towards peace. This determination is most often justified by the threat IS poses to Europe and the US. But the British government argues it also directly relates to keeping alive a moderate opposition. The rather mysterious force of 70,000 fighters talked about by David Cameron as "troops on the ground" morphs before our eyes into a vulnerable but essential group to be preserved. I was watching a crucial but largely ignored Defence Committee meeting just before last week's Commons vote. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told the committee the 70,000 "are fighting Assad, and one of the reasons for us getting more involved in tacking Isil [a longer acronym for Islamic State] in Syria is so that they are not being squeezed by both sides". The deputy chief of the defence staff, Lt Gen Gordon Messenger, helpfully spelt out the need to "preserve them as part of a future political process". He added: "Nor are we saying they are ready to advance to Raqqa - but we are saying they are a really important group to preserve. "Because we see them as being a vital part of the political process, critical to preserve to prevent Syria becoming a choice between Assad or Isil, so they are a very important part of the dynamic." The West's hopes for an alternative Syria seem based on crossed fingers rather than serious analysis. The survival of a moderate opposition may depend not on British bombs but Russian ones. If Russia continues to target it, it will not be a force at the negotiating table, and there will be no real reason for President Assad to come to the table. It is very unpalatable for the West, but President Putin's military intervention means he holds the key to Syria's future. Syria, the US and the rest of the Western alliance hangs on his next move. Is this a victory for President Bashar al-Assad? The withdrawal of the last remaining rebels from al-Wair is a blow to the opposition because it gives the government complete control over what was once the centre of the uprising against the president. Has it come about because of Russia's intervention? The Syrian military launched an offensive on rebel-held areas outside Homs after Russia began its air campaign two months ago. But al-Wair fell because its residents were besieged for almost three years, coming under continuous and heavy bombardment and receiving only limited and irregular supplies. Does this offer hope for a wider peace deal? Local ceasefires such as the one that allowed the al-Wair withdrawal - negotiated by Syrians, rather than involving outside states - may be the most effective way of gradually bringing peace to the country. Why are rebel and opposition factions meeting in Saudi Arabia? Leading opposition politicians and rebels are for the first time meeting in an attempt to agree a common position ahead of peace talks with the government, which world powers want to start in Vienna next month. Will those talks lead to peace talks with the government? Analysts say trying to get the disparate factions to agree to the same platform and negotiate as one unit will prove very difficult, if not impossible.	The Syrian city seen as the capital of the revolution has fallen, by agreement.
Emergency teams are searching for another 15 people who are missing. Rivers burst their banks, destroying buildings and roads after more than 50cm (20in) of rain fell over a 12-hour period on parts of the south-western island of Kyushu on Wednesday. Rescuers are working through thick mud to try to reach stranded survivors. Hundreds have already been evacuated. The worst-hit areas are in Fukuoka prefecture. Announcing the revised death toll, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the region was expected to see further heavy rain on Saturday. About 12,000 police, military, firefighters and coast guard personnel have taking part in the rescue operation.	The death toll from flooding caused by recent heavy rain in southern Japan has risen to at least 15, officials say.
Kingfisher House, near the domestic airport in the western city of Mumbai (Bombay), was being sold by lenders to recover losses. However, bidders appeared to be deterred by the asking price of 1.5bn rupees ($22m; Â£15m). The businessman is said to have some $1.4bn of unpaid debts after his Kingfisher airline collapsed in 2013. Speculation rose about his whereabouts after a consortium of banks and creditors approached the Supreme Court over  unpaid debts. They demanded that his passport be impounded, and that $75m in severance pay he was to receive from Diageo be blocked and used to repay them. The payout was blocked, but it emerged that Mr Mallya had already left India. Later in a series of tweets he denied that he was "absconding" as was being alleged in India. Media reports say Mr Mallya is currently living in London. Opposition MPs have demanded that the government bring him back to face the law. Mr Mallya, who is a household name in India, sold a large chunk of United Spirits, which he inherited from his father, to Diageo in April 2014. He was to receive the $75m payout as settlement after being ousted from the firm in February. Mr Mallya, once dubbed by Indian media as "India's Richard Branson" and the "King of Good Times" for his lavish lifestyle, also owns a stake in the Formula One team Force India.	An auction to sell a property belonging to Indian drinks baron Vijay Mallya has failed to attract any bidders.
The 26-year-old Samoan, who started his career with Manly Sea Eagles, made six appearances for the NRL champions last season. He told the club website: "I'm ready now to take my game up to a new level and Castleford sounds perfect for me. "I'm looking forward to playing for a club that plays such a big part in the community."	Castleford Tigers have signed Cronulla Sharks forward Jesse Sene-Lefao on a two-year deal.
Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of murdering the beautician, while her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid is being held as an accessory to murder. The men's lawyers, however, say they will apply to have the case dismissed due to a "complete lack of evidence". Ms Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in July in Pakistan. Live updates and more from across West Yorkshire Following a court hearing in Jhelum, in the state of Punjab, both men were remanded into custody ahead of their next appearance on 20 October. The judge ordered that Ms Shahid's second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazim should also appear on that date. Mr Kazim, who married Ms Shahid in Leeds in 2014 before the couple moved to Dubai in 2015, claims his wife was murdered because her family disapproved of their marriage. It is thought Ms Shahid had travelled to Pakistan to visit family in the village of Pandori after being told her father was ill. Her relatives in Pakistan initially said she had suffered a heart attack but a post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of being strangled.	Lawyers representing the first husband and father of alleged "honour killing" victim Samia Shahid say they will seek to have the case thrown out.
There have been calls for reform of the system, which often sees highly-paid council chiefs get extra payments of tens of thousands of pounds. Holyrood's local government committee is to examine how the payments are made and how appropriate they are. Convener Bob Doris said there was "understandable public concern" about the sums being paid out. Returning officers have been in high demand in recent years, with Scotland going to the polls for five elections and referendums across three years. It is estimated that almost Â£500,000 was shared between the 32 returning officers inside a matter of weeks in 2016, due to the Holyrood election and the EU referendum. Mr Doris said the total sum may stretch to Â£1m over two years when the 2015 general election is taken into account. The SNP MSP said: "The level of payment varies for different elections and different councils, and we're also aware some returning officers claim their payment, while others share payments with their staff. We want to find out more about how these payments operate, what their uptake is and whether they remain appropriate." Returning officers are responsible for ensuring the smooth running of elections at a local, national and European level, as well as referendums. The role is often carried out by council chief executives on top of their normal duties. MSPs will hear from electoral law experts and local government officials, trade unions and academics as well as returning officers across two meetings in November.	MSPs are to examine the payments received by election returning officers in Scotland.
Casey posted a one-under 71 to move to seven under, while Fleetwood and Americans Brian Harman and Brooks Koepka signed for 70s at Erin Hills. For the first time since world rankings began in 1986, the world's top three have missed the cut at a major. Defending champion Dustin Johnson (+4), Rory McIlory (+5) and Jason Day (+10) finished above the one-over-par cut. Overnight leader Rickie Fowler was going on serenely at nine under until three successive bogeys from the 11th saw him drop back into the pack. The American recovered to post five pars and salvage a one-over 73 to sit one off the lead, with Jamie Lovemark and JB Holmes who both shot 69s. World number one Johnson, who recorded his first major victory in this tournament at Oakmont a year ago, flirted with the projected cut mark all day. He opened on three over but birdied the first two holes. However, he was unable to build on that momentum and was still one over par after a birdie on the 12th. Bogeys on the 13th and 14th dropped him back to three over and a further shot went on the 17th. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who was playing his first tournament after a month out injured and only his seventh of the year, signed for a one-under 71, after knocking in four birdies in his final six holes, but the damage was done by his six-over 78 in round one. "I showed up for the last six holes at least," joked world number two McIlroy, who misses his second successive US Open cut. "I saw some positives on the back nine to take into next week and, even though this is disappointing, the last two rounds will serve me well in this busy summer." World number three Day followed his opening 79 with a 75 to limp out on 10 over. "It's been the best preparation going into a major in my career," said the Australian, who conceded: "I was in the hay too much over the last couple of days." After opening with a six-under 66, Casey was one off the overnight lead as he went out among the early starters on Friday. He started on the 10th, birdied the 11th but bogeyed the 12th before coming unstuck on the 14th. He was within 100 yards of the green after two shots but hit his third in to deep rough and took five from there to post a triple-bogey eight. A bogey on 15 dropped him to two under but a run of five birdies followed to catapult him to the top of the leaderboard. "It's very difficult to get through a major championship, let alone a US Open, without a blemish on your card," the 39-year-old told BBC Sport. "I made a complete mess on the 14th. It's how you react to it. I tried to take my medicine and then messed up the next hole. But I got on a wonderful birdie streak. "It was important to do that. I didn't change the game plan. John, my caddie and I kept communication great. We talked it out and got back to hitting the fairways and doing the basics and that led to some birdies on the front nine. I'm really, really happy with it." Southport's Fleetwood said it would be "nice to sit down to dinner knowing you're top of the US Open leaderboard" after overcoming "a ropey start" to his second round. The 26-year-old bogeyed the first hole but had three birdies and 12 pars before dropping his next shot on the 17th. However, he finished his round well with a birdie at the par-five 18th. "I was enjoying it," he told BBC Sport. "I had a couple of bad drives early in the round and I had to focus on my rhythm and slow things down but as I got into the round it became more natural and I hit a lot of good shots and felt comfortable out there. "I've never led a US Open, so it will be a very cool experience." Japan's Hideki Matsuyama posted the joint-lowest round of the day, a seven-under-par 65 to move into a tie for eighth on five under. The world number four knocked in six birdies on the front nine and one more on the back nine in a bogey-free round. However he missed an opportunity to tie Jonny Miller's US Open single round record of eight under when his nine-foot birdie attempt at the last stayed up. Matsuyama is joined on five under by, among others, amateur Cameron Champ who had three-under-par 69. American Chez Reavie also leapt up the leaderboard with a 65 to get to four under - he had eight birdies and one bogey - and missed a 25-foot putt to tie Miller's 1973 record on the short ninth. Masters champion Sergio Garcia kept his challenge on track with a solid one-under-par 71. He signed for three birdies and two bogeys to finish three under, alongside 2014 US Open winner Martin Kaymer (69) and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger (72). American Jordan Spieth, winner in 2015, birdied two of his first four holes to get to one under but a bogey on the sixth checked his progress as he posted a one-under 71 to move to level par. With the cut coming at one over, the joint-lowest 36-hole mark in US Open history, the 68 players who will contest the final two rounds are all within eight shots of the lead - the same number of shots Matsuyama made up on playing partner Fowler in round two. Olympic champion Justin Rose is another who will be heading home early after carding a two-over 74. The Englishman, champion in 2013, birdied the par-five seventh to move to level par but bogeyed the next two to finish the tournament on two over. In fact, of the 14 Englishmen, three Scots, two Northern Irishmen and one Welshman who started on Thursday, only seven will play the weekend. Andrew Johnston is five off the lead after a 73, while fellow Englishmen Eddie Pepperell (71) and Matt Fitzpatrick (73), and Scotland's Martin Laird (71) are in a group on one under. Lee Westwood had a three-over 75 to drop back to level par. Among those missing the cut were Bradley Dredge of Wales and England's Chris Wood on three over while 2010 champion Graeme McDowell closed on five over. England's 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett, who posted a nine-over 81 in round one, withdrew before the start of his second round with a back injury.	English duo Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood are in a four-way tie for the lead after two rounds of the US Open.
The 21-year-old, who has appeared 82 times for Brighton, played five games on loan at Karl Robinson's Championship strugglers earlier this campaign. The England Under-21 international is eligible for Saturday's FA Cup third-round match against Northampton Town. "I've been here before, I know what the club is all about and I just can't wait to get started," he said. Robinson added to the club website: "I felt he was a real success in his first spell with us earlier this season and this was highlighted when we looked back and saw he was the top of our attacking stats for a midfield player. "When he was here before, Darren Potter wasn't fit and Samir Carruthers wasn't playing in central midfield and, as a group, this time around I'm sure they will offer good balance."

Media playback is not supported on this device Mignolet struggled as the Reds twice gave away the lead in a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Premier League leaders. "For the second goal he needs help from all the players," said Klopp, in reference to Mignolet scrambling as Olivier Giroud scored from a corner. The Belgium goalkeeper, 27, is set to sign a new five-year contract. Mignolet, who joined the Reds from Sunderland in a £9m deal in June 2013, was also beaten at his near post by Aaron Ramsey for Arsenal's first equaliser. Klopp, who has consistently backed Mignolet, added: "On the second goal, on a perfect day he can make a save but there were a lot of mistakes before. "We have to defend this better." Liverpool's goalkeeping weaknesses have been exposed by errors from Mignolet's deputy Adam Bogdan in the 3-0 defeat at Watford and the 2-2 FA Cup draw at Exeter. That has prompted Klopp to recall 22-year-old Welshman Danny Ward, a substitute on Wednesday, from a successful loan spell at Aberdeen. Liverpool snatched a deserved draw with Arsenal thanks to Joe Allen's late equaliser. Roberto Firmino twice gave Liverpool the lead in a breathless first half, the second a spectacular 20-yard drive, but Arsenal levelled through Ramsey and Giroud. Giroud's second-half strike - his 18th goal of the season - looked to have put the Gunners on course for a crucial victory, but substitute Allen rewarded the hosts for a display bursting with energy and spirit with a low 90th-minute finish. Media playback is not supported on this device Klopp was delighted with the performance of Brazil forward Firmino, who has struggled to live up to his £29m transfer fee since arriving from Hoffenheim in the summer. The German said: "I could talk about this for half an hour. He doesn't know how good he is. If you are good, you have to show it. "He had a really good game but he was not the only one. I could talk about special performances - we had a lot of other players." Klopp was also involved in an angry first-half exchange with fourth official Robert Madley and was calmed down, amiably, by his opposite number Arsene Wenger. He said: "I told Arsene why I was a little bit emotional. It was a clear throw-in for us in a good moment, a good phase. I said what I said, he said what he said. "We had nothing, it was friendly."	Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp defended under-fire goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after his latest uncertain display in the draw with Arsenal at Anfield.
The poll was held as former Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies stood down to run for - and win - the Welsh Assembly election in the same area, part of Bridgend county borough. In the 2015 General Election, Labour won the seat with 52% of the vote and the Conservatives came second with 15%. UKIP came second this time around.	Labour's Christopher Elmore has become the new MP for Ogmore after winning the Parliamentary by-election with 52% of the vote.
Mansfield District Council stopped people riding around the market place to combat "anti-social" cycling. However, it said "responsible" cyclists were welcome in the same place for the Tour of Britain on 6 September. Campaign group Cycling UK said Mansfield hosting the race was illogical. The group is currently supporting six cyclists who are challenging the council over a public spaces protection order (PSPO), issued a year ago, which prohibits people from cycling in the pedestrianised market place area. Anyone who fails to dismount when asked could be fined. Cycling UK spokesman Duncan Dollimore said: "They are marketing the town as cycle friendly, but not to people who want to shop there. "We would never defend cycling anti-social behaviour, but why not deal with those being stupid and not responsible cyclists. "They are effectively saying cycling is anti-social." He also criticised the council's own promotional video showing a cyclist riding through areas which are prohibited. In a statement, Mansfield District Council said it welcomed responsible cyclists to the town to view the race, but with care and consideration. Riders have been encouraged to dismount, but "normal" rules concerning the PSPO will not be in operation for the "special event". Mansfield's mayor Kate Allsop said: "This is about safety. This event will be properly monitored and managed. "What we don't want is people dashing through the town centre on their bikes frightening or upsetting people. "This is a special event and it would have been a dreadful shame if we were so inflexible that we would not host this amazing opportunity."	A council has been accused of double standards for allowing a stage of a major cycle race to start in a town centre where cyclists have been banned.
Benchmark Brent crude hit $50.22 per barrel at one stage on Thursday, its highest level since early November. The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: "We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing." Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said: "The oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand. "With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected." In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC: "This is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess." However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. "It's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound," he said. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil markets analyst at Natixis, agreed and said: "We believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections."	The price of oil has gone above $50 a barrel for the first time in 2016 as supply disruptions and increased global demand continue to fuel a recovery.
The Green Lions, hosting the first ever cup match on the island, forced the preliminary qualifying round tie to a replay with a 2-2 draw on Saturday. Guernsey, who often struggle for player availability, now travel to London. "Okay we got something out of the game, but more so it is a game we could have done without from a financial and logistical point of view," Vance said. Guernsey, who play in English football's eighth tier, battled back from two goals down in front of a crowd of 1,142. Dave Rihoy scored both goals for the hosts after the break, helping makeup for what Vance said was an "awful and lifeless" first-half performance. "It wasn't good enough, we didn't have the right energy or movement. We were reactive and not proactive and put ourselves in a situation where we had to try do something. "As much as I'm frustrated with the players for first half, I'll give them loads of credit for the second half. I'm proud."

Guernsey boss Tony Vance admits their FA Cup replay against Thamesmead Town on Tuesday will be a costly burden.
The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time. Around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees are to transfer to the new business as part of the deal. Tesco said in a statement that this is an "orderly and efficient exit from the US market". Under the terms of the deal, Tesco will loan the new business around Â£80m. Fresh & Easy, which operates 200 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has lost money since opening in 2007. Tesco did not specify which stores are being transferred to Yucaipa, but it is understood the remaining 50 shops will be closed. It will cost Tesco Â£150m to dispose of the Fresh & Easy brand, but part of that is a loan which may be paid back. Also, if Yucaipa is sucessful and the business becomes profitable, Tesco has the option to buy a stake. Yucaipa is a Los Angeles based private equity company focused on supermaket and restaurant businesses and is run by billionaire investor Ron Burkle. In April of this year, Tesco reported its first fall in annual profits for 20 years.	Tesco has agreed to sell 150 of its Fresh & Easy stores to the investment company Yucaipa Companies.
General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the "leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the "murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro". "This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order," said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out "a possible military option if necessary" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of "craziness". He told Venezuela's state television: "It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. "As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela." The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader "as soon as democracy is restored in that country".	Two renegade officers who attacked a Venezuelan army base last weekend have been captured, the country's defence minister has said.
Noel Conway, who is 67 and has motor neurone disease, wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates further. He said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones "at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically". Any doctor who helped him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Mr Conway was too weak to attend the court in person. His lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the High Court in London that Mr Conway faced a stark choice either to seek to bring about his own death now whilst still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it comes. Mr Gordon said the change to the law that Mr Conway wanted would apply only to adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have a settled wish to die. Mr Conway, of Shrewsbury, told the BBC: "I will be quadriplegic. I could be virtually catatonic and conceivably be in a locked-in syndrome - that to me would be a living hell. That prospect is one I cannot accept." MPs reject 'right to die' law British man dies at Dignitas centre Assisted dying debate: The key questions Mr Conway, a retired college lecturer, was once fit and active but motor neurone disease is gradually destroying all strength in his muscles. He cannot walk and increasingly relies on a ventilator to help him breathe.  As his disease progresses, he fears becoming entombed in his body. Mr Conway is being supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, but the issue polarises opinion. Baroness Jane Campbell - a disability rights campaigner - says changing the law would send all the wrong signals. The last major challenge to the law was turned down by the Supreme Court three years ago. It ruled that while judges could interpret the law it was up to Parliament to decide whether to change it. In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years. Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced. The case is expected to take up to four days. Assisted suicide - helping or encouraging another person to kill themselves - is illegal under English law. Under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) for England and Wales, it is punishable by up to 14 year's imprisonment. In Scotland, helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the law, as well as some high-profile cases that have challenged it. 2001: Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, fought a long, and unsuccessfully, legal battle to win the right for her to end her life. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that her husband should be given immunity from prosecution should he help her to die. She lost and died at a hospice near her home in 2002. 2009: Debbie Purdy, who had multiple sclerosis, won a landmark ruling in 2009 when the courts agreed that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to a Swiss clinic where she could end her life. That prompted Keir Starmer - the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales - to publish guidelines setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution. Debbie died in a hospice in England in 2014. 2012: Two men suffering from locked-in syndrome lost their legal fight to be helped to die. Tony Nicklinson and a man known only as Martin - both left paralysed after a stroke - had argued that doctors should be allowed to end their lives without punishment. Martin argued that the DPP policy on encouraging or assisted suicide was not clear enough for people such as carers to know how they could provide assistance without the risk of being prosecuted. Tony Nicklinson died in August 2012 after refusing food. 2016: The family of deceased locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson and paralysed road accident victim Paul Lamb lose their right-to-die challenges at the European Court of Human rights. They campaigned that disabled people should have the right to be helped to die with dignity.	The High Court has begun hearing the legal challenge of a terminally ill UK man who wants the right to die.
The hosts closed on 152-3, a lead of 128, after 10 wickets fell in the day. Mehedi Hasan Miraz (6-82) reduced England to 144-8 but Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid put on 99 to give England a first-innings lead of 24. However, Imrul Kayes hit an unbeaten 59 and Mohammad Mahmudullah made 47 as Bangladesh regained the initiative. Mahmudullah was bowled by England debutant Zafar Ansari with the final ball of the day after the left-arm spinner had earlier dismissed Tamim Iqbal for his first international wicket. Bangladesh's only victories since their first Test in 2000 have come against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Another fluctuating Test sees England on the back foot and Bangladesh once again contemplating victory. England's bowlers created little pressure and it isn't immediately obvious who will step up tomorrow morning to bowl Bangladesh out. What is certain is that 250 would take some getting and Bangladesh are well on course for setting England a real challenge. Mehedi, 19, tormented England in the first Test in Chittagong and became only the third spinner to take five wickets in the first innings of each of his first two Test matches. Having taken two wickets on day one to reduce England to 50-3, off-spinner Mehedi bowled Moeen Ali in the third over of the day, with the England all-rounder playing an ill-advised sweep. Ben Stokes was out in the following over, caught off Taijul Islam, bringing Jonny Bairstow to the crease. He put on 45 with Joe Root to steady the visitors after they had slipped to 69-5, but Mehedi returned to trap Bairstow lbw for 24 with his first ball of a new spell - and then had Ansari caught at gully for his fifth wicket of the innings. Media playback is not supported on this device Root batted well to score his 23rd Test half-century, but when Taijul took his wicket England were rocking at 144-8. However, Woakes (46) and Rashid (44) excelled as Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim rotated his bowlers, their partnership of 224 balls and 127 minutes taking England from a deficit of 76 into the lead. The stand was England's highest for the ninth wicket in Asia and was in stark contrast to the Bangladesh innings, where they fell from 171-1 to 220 all out. The partnership perhaps should have been cut short, though. Woakes, on 38 at the time, hit a high full toss from Sabbir Rahman straight to the mid-wicket fielder, but he was given a reprieve when TV umpire Chris Gaffaney judged that the ball had reached the batsman above waist height and gave a no-ball, despite later replays suggesting the wicket should have stood. Woakes was eventually out when Mehedi returned with the new ball and claimed his sixth wicket, while Steven Finn was the last man out for 0 off the bowling of Taijul. Bangladesh's openers Tamim and Kayes batted positively in the final session to wipe out England's lead, reaching 65 before Ansari dismissed Tamim to claim his first Test wicket. England captain Alastair Cook then caught Mominul Haque at slip off Stokes in next over and the tourists seemed to have the momentum. However, Kayes and Mahmudullah played freely to put on 86 before Mahmudullah played a loose attacking shot and was bowled by Ansari with what turned out to be the final ball of the day. Bangladesh scored at almost five runs per over in the final session as Finn and Rashid, both wicketless in the first innings, went at six runs per over, while Woakes conceded 14 from his two overs. England all-rounder Chris Woakes on BBC Test Match Special: "That wicket at the end gives us a bit of hope going into tomorrow. I think we've had a reasonably good day. "We'd have liked to have got a few more runs early on this morning but the partnership between myself and Rash got us up ahead of them. "I don't think the pitch will get any better - it will only get worse, if anything. We've got a long batting line-up but we don't want to chase too many. "It's important when we come out tomorrow we firstly try to keep the run rate down so they don't get away from us, but also look to take wickets. It's a tricky thing to do. "If we can pick up a few early ones, we know they can roll easily."	England face a battle to prevent Bangladesh earning their most famous Test victory after an absorbing second day of the second Test in Dhaka.
Sandwell Councillor Mahboob Hussain is accused of six alleged council code of conduct breaches, according to solicitors Gowling WLG. The law firm was brought in 15 months ago to investigate alleged irregularities in the sale of the authority's former properties. Mr Hussain, now suspended by Labour, denies any wrongdoing. Gowling investigated alleged irregularities in sales from 2011-2013, including three old public toilet blocks and a former coroner's office in Smethwick. A parallel police investigation ended in March with no further action. Publication of Gowling's report had been delayed after legal action by "one of the parties named", the council said, but was published on Friday "in the public interest". Documents leaked to the BBC earlier had shed light on its findings. The authority's chief executive Jan Britton said the "next step" was to refer allegations to its internal disciplinary watchdog-  the standards committee - to consider. Mr Britton said a review would take place to "tighten up council procedures on land sales" and it would "consider if any disciplinary action against employees was required." The allegations set out in the report include: Former economy chief councillor Mr Jones and Mr Hussain stood down from the ruling cabinet after investigations began, but both had their suspensions from the Labour party lifted before elections on 5 May. Mr Hussain has now been suspended afresh, the party confirmed. Tipton Green ward councillor Mr Jones, whom the report said faced no misconduct issue, said he was "pleased" to see the report published and with those conclusions. He added: "Throughout this matter I have always protested my innocence of any wrongdoing and I have always fully co-operated with all investigations." Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain gave evidence to the report that he did not know who was buying the toilet blocks because the purchase was through a company name, not the name of his friend. He said he had not been consulted and had not been aware of the price. Mr Hafeez, who was arrested last year, provided no evidence despite requests, the report said. He has not yet responded to further questions from the BBC. Police told him in November 2015 he would face no action. He said in November his arrest "did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties" and he was "considering taking legal action against a number of individuals and organisations". Analysis Behind this saga is no little irony. The council introduced its so-called asset management strategy, under which it planned to streamline its operations into fewer buildings, to reduce its overheads and bring in some money by selling off property it no longer needed, it said to mitigate government cuts. In the months since these investigations began, the council has spent thousands of pounds on solicitors to investigate these serious allegations â€Žand commissioning James Goudie QC to advise the council on whether it could publish the solicitors' work, putting a big dent in any money it might have made on these sales.	Misconduct alleged against a former deputy council leader will be pursued, the authority says.
The Handlebar Club, which is holding the contest as it celebrates its 70th year, first met on 1 April 1947, and according to club secretary Steve Parsons "nothing has changed since then". "There aren't many rules," he said. "But you have to have a moustache of graspable extremities." The club specifies that beards are not allowed, and on its page of FAQs - which provides advice on issues ranging from moustache curlers to moustache cups - it advises people whose interest lies more in beards to contact The British Beard Club. About 100 people are expected at this year's Handlebar annual meeting which takes place at the Dover Marina Hotel. They have travelled from across Europe and from as far afield as the US, Mr Parsons said. On a more serious note, Mr Parsons explained the club, which has monthly meetings in London, raises money for charity. Hirsute conversation lasts for about an hour, and members gather to have a laugh about their "silly moustache", but the club was set up for social reasons. Founded by comedians and broadcasters including Jimmy Edwards, Frank Muir and Raymond Glendenning, the club first met in the dressing room of the Windmill Theatre, London, and was about preserving wartime camaraderie, Mr Parsons said. "It was set up on April Fool's Day just after the war. "Most had been in the RAF and wanted to keep the camaraderie," Mr Parsons explained. "It's a tradition and it's about the Britishness of it all."	The title of best moustache is up for grabs as top lip titans clash in Dover for the honour of being crowned owner of the world's wackiest whiskers.

After a five-year approval process, the humble Yakka Skink - a secretive lizard known to hide under rocks and inside hollow logs - and the Ornamental Snake brought to a halt a A$16bn ($12bn; Â£8bn) mine, rail and port project proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland. The two reptiles are among Australia's most threatened species. Because the federal environment minister failed to take into account what the mine could mean for their habitat, his earlier approval for the mine was overturned by the Federal Court of Australia. The mine may still go ahead but the delay is the latest chapter in a long history of Australian flora and fauna causing grief to developers. Back in 1995, one of the last known colonies of the endangered Green and Gold Bell frog delayed the construction of a multi-million dollar residential development in inner-city Sydney. A few years later, the frogs were found frolicking in an abandoned brick pit where authorities had planned to build a tennis court for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The courts were built elsewhere while the frogs got a specially built habitat. Now they are in the way of a key major road project in Sydney. In the mid 2000s, a new species of flowering shrub was discovered in the Lower Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. Named Persoonia pauciflora, botanists were excited to discover it grew nowhere else in the world. Unfortunately, it was growing on the site of a proposed housing development. When word got around, someone ripped out 300 of the last 500 of these rare plants. The culprit was never found. The discovery of a threatened or new species can cause havoc for developers, delaying or even putting an end to a project. What overturned the Queensland mine's approval? A small conservation group in Mackay, Queensland, challenged the environment minister's decision to approve the mine on a number of legal bases, including: Approved Conservation Advices are scientific and legal documents that explain the conservation requirements of species to avoid their extinction. It was this last point that convinced the court to overturn the minister's approval. In the state of Victoria, the Orange-bellied Parrot was centre stage in a long-running saga about whether a wind farm could be built in South Gippsland. The federal environment minister banned the 52-turbine project in 2006, on advice that turbine blades posed a small risk to the critically endangered bird. The minister eventually reversed his own decision and the wind farm is going ahead. In the case of Indian company Adani's giant coal mine in Queensland, environmentalists and scientists are worried about more than threats to reptiles. Dredging associated with an expansion of port facilities for the mine poses a huge risk to the Great Barrier Reef; exports would further entrench the world's reliance on carbon polluting fossil fuels; and the mine could threaten artesian water. The Department of the Environment on Wednesday said reconsideration of the project did not require revisiting the entire approval process. New approval documentation could be ready within eight weeks. Adani described the court decision as simply a "technical legal error". But environmentalists say protecting endangered species is vital work. "To describe an endangered species as a technicality and groundwater as a technicality is in line with Adani's environmental record around the world, which is appalling," said Geoff Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. "The government should simply strike this project down."	This week a giant coal mine that could produce millions of tonnes of coal for export to India was scuttled by two Australian reptiles.
It is hoped the sale, to be handled by estate agent Knight Frank, will cover the Â£502m debts accrued by a firm which tried to redevelop the landmark site. The 39-acre property is on the Thames and a new public park is planned there. Chancellor George Osborne has confirmed government backing for plans to extend the London Underground's Northern Line into the heart of the area. Stephan Miles-Brown, head of residential development at Knight Frank, said: "This is the first time Battersea Power Station has ever been offered for sale on the open market. "As one of the UK's most recognisable landmarks, Knight Frank anticipates considerable interest in a scheme that is among the most exciting in the world today. "Battersea Power Station is as iconic as the Chrysler Building in New York or the Eiffel Tower, and familiar to people who may have never even been to London." The Grade II listed building opened in 1933 and generated power until 1983. As such any building work would require listed building consent - even minor works, such as painting. It was acquired by Real Estate Opportunities, the majority owner of the holding company, in 2006. Last year its debts on the project were called in by creditors.	Battersea Power Station is being offered for sale on the open market for the first time.
Special Report: The Technology of Business The workplaces that build Africa's future Is teleworking driving us crazy? The tech getting disabled people into work Recruitment robots need impressing Is technology killing the lure of company heritage? If you're not at work catching up when you think the boss isn't looking, you're quite likely to be on the sofa in front of the television. If so then you're not alone. According to research by Nielsen 88% of US tablet owners use them while watching TV at least once a month, with 45% using them several times a day. In the UK, that figure is 80%, with 24% using it daily. These countries may be at the top of the list - but the figures point to a growing trend. Rather than resign themselves to audiences watching with half an eye, while posting pictures of kittens on Facebook, broadcasters are looking for ways to harness this trend to keep viewers engaged. No verifiable eyeballs on your content leads to dwindling advertising income. At IBC, the annual gathering of the broadcast industry in Amsterdam, the rise of the second screen, or companion device (that's a tablet or smartphone to you and me) was the topic of the moment. If the idea of a coming zombie apocalypse keeps you up at night, you may have found yourself watching The Walking Dead for tips. So many of us tuned in that its broadcaster, FX UK, decided to create a companion app for series two that would appeal to viewers, but that would keep those precious eyeballs glued to the screen during the important bits. "It was fascinating to tie [the app] with the idea of gamification with that particular programme, with that fanbase, which seemed to make sense," says Steve Plunkett, chief technology officer at broadcast technology and service provider Red Bee. "But we had no idea how it was going to play out with the public. So we were delighted to see the take-up rates which were great." As well as being popular with audiences, it has also won an IBC innovation award. A bit like Cluedo for the undead, the app lets you predict how many zombies will bite the dust during each episode, who will despatch them, and the most common weapon of choice. As each member of the undead hordes meets their maker, the app notes the kill, who was responsible and how they did it. At the end of the episode viewers discover how close they got, and can then share the results on Facebook and Twitter. "What's interesting is that we can now accurately tie together the two screens," says Mr Plunkett. "We knew exactly what episode you were watching, you just switched on and it figured everything out, and knew exactly where you were in the programme." It uses technology known as audio watermarking, which lets the app work whether you watch live, time-shifted or recorded on your DVR. Tiny chunks of data that are inaudible to humans are embedded in the soundtrack of the show. The device running the app then "listens" as the episode starts, works out which one you are watching and synchronises with it. For content where it's not possible or practical to embed data, audio fingerprinting can be used, where specific audio triggers the synchronisation of an app. For devices that don't have microphones, signals sent via the internet can also be used. Another show with a cult following that has its own companion app is US biker gang saga Sons of Anarchy. The app has evolved over two seasons, according to Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan. "[In our proof of concept app] you see a character you like, you want his hat, you want his jacket. They had all the items already on the website, but by presenting it on this app they really saw a huge uptake of sales. "This year we have a full application that has trivia that gets people really engaged in the show, exclusive on-set photos and some of the writers on the show have contributed to the content in the application." The app also synchronises with each episode, letting viewers track the conversation about episodes on social media - regardless of when they're watching. "We built something called the social timeline so you can actually follow the show through tweets that are happening as things happen specifically in the show. "This really works well in times-shifted environments - different time zones, catch-up TV situations where you still want to follow along the conversation." The next step for Magic Ruby is looking at new ways of making money from these apps. "It would probably be difficult to do the traditional or banner advertising in this space," he says. "So it's how do we get advertisers to do interactive advertising, get involved in the show, it's not just your watching the show and this car commercial that has zero context comes up." John Stoneman of mobile advertising specialists InMobi agrees. "For it to be effective, it needs to be complementary to the user's experience and not obtrusive... and that's one of the great things about the second screen. The consumer has the option to engage if they want to, but it's not forcing them to sit through something they don't want." Mr Stoneman believes broadcasters need to come to terms with second screen devices, and how they're being used. The chief executive of online video platform Brightcove, Jeremy Allaire, believes there's a more radical shift taking place. The company recently launched their app creation platform AppCloud, aimed at letting broadcasters and other content creators build companion apps. "In my mind I think that the current effort is sort of a band-aid or a hack, and the real opportunity is when the full content experience and the applications that interact with that content are all delivered over the internet to tablets or smart TVs." he says. The company is also creating full screen TV apps aimed at content far beyond regular programming. "Dual screen TV apps are about really using the TV set as the second screen. "The tablet becomes the primary screen you interact with, you make choices on, and discover on and the large display is where you have rich media and consume content and information." Perhaps unsurprisingly he has strong views on the future of television. "Linear television is not going to be saved by companion second-screen applications, that's for sure. I think you know more likely 90% of the content that's on linear television should really just be content that's published on demand." Not everyone agrees. Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan sees things differently. "I think people still love TV, they love the content, and now they can have the interactivity and the interactivity with their friends. "You're by yourself on the couch and you're watching with multiple people. It's perfect for live events, for sports, for reality shows, water-cooler-type TV shows." No knows what lies ahead - but maybe there's room for something in between. One of the most popular demonstrations at IBC is broadcast software experts NDS' video wall. In their conception of the future the walls of our home become a giant television screen, that integrates with the wallpaper. Content selection is done from a tablet device, and is "thrown" to the wall you want to view it on. This can be anything from movies, television, radio, social media and news to the family calendar, the view from your nannycam, or family photos and videos. It can be any size you want, with as much or as little content on display. Audio is directional, and advertising and other broadcast furniture can be arranged around the picture, leaving the image clean. At the moment screen technology means the bevels are clearly visible between panels. But it doesn't take much imagination to picture technology like Sony's new 4k ultra-high definition television, also on show at the exhibition, or NHK's 8k super hi vision, or even Dolby's glasses-free 3D making the experience even more immersive. Whatever the future holds, one thing is clear. As a species we are likely to become ever more addicted to vast amounts of content - wherever it comes from. As long as the zombies don't get us first...	Where are you reading this?
Devon and Cornwall Police were called to the statue of General Buller in Exeter at 23:40 BST on Saturday. The 18-year-old, from the Exeter area, was climbing on the 15ft (4.5m) statue - a well known landmark which depicts General Redvers Buller on horseback, mounted on a large granite plinth - when he fell. He suffered serious neck and back injuries and died in hospital. More on statue fall and other Devon stories	A man has died after falling from a city centre statue late at night.
The 26-year-old German tore cartilage in his knee during the Premier League defeat by Chelsea on 14 December, coming off after 57 minutes. Kirchhoff was making only his eighth appearance of the season, and had two months out with a hamstring injury. Sunderland, who visit Manchester United on Boxing Day, are 18th in the Premier League and one point from safety. Black Cats forward Duncan Watmore is out for the season with a cruciate knee ligament injury.	Sunderland midfielder Jan Kirchhoff is expected to be out for 12 weeks after having knee surgery.
The sum is on top of more than £1.2bn set aside in previous years' provisions. Parent company National Australian Bank (NAB) said between £350m and £500m more would be set aside this year, but added that the final cost remained uncertain. The move was announced in its third quarter results on Monday. Up until the end of March, NAB had set aside £806m to compensate customers for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). A total of £325m has already been paid out. NAB's cumulative provisions relating to interest rate hedging products amounted to £431m, about half of which has been paid out. This year's extra funding will come from a £1.7bn mis-selling fund, which the bank is being required by UK regulators to make available after the Clydesdale is floated. NAB is in the process of demerging and floating Glasgow-based Clydesdale, which includes the Yorkshire Bank. It intends to complete the break-up by the end of this year. In a statement, NAB said "substantial progress" had been made on the demerger and stock market sale. It will provide more detail with full-year results in late October. The Australian banking group has been working hard to offload the Clydesdale, which amassed a large portfolio of bad property loans. It has also been facing high costs of redress for mis-selling payment protection insurance and complex systems for business customers to protect against interest rate changes.	Clydesdale Bank is to set aside as much as £500m in extra funding this year to compensate customers for mis-selling of financial products.
Mr Gove, the UK environment secretary, said British fishermen would not have the capacity to land all of the fish in British territorial waters. And he said that some access would therefore be granted to vessels from other countries. He was speaking during a fact-finding mission to Denmark, which was largely focused on the Danish food industry. The Danish fishing industry is currently highly-dependent on fish caught in UK territorial waters. The meeting was attended by Niels Wichmann, chief executive of the Danish Fishermen organisation, who told BBC Scotland that there was no suggestion from Mr Gove that Denmark would receive preferential treatment. And he said Mr Gove "did not say numerous countries, he just said other countries" would be granted access. Mr Wichmann added: "The thing is he was just being realistic and he was saying that we need, within the Brexit negotiations phase, to find out where the final goal is, the final solution to the fisheries. "The fisheries will be outside the common fisheries policy and we need a transitional period. In that transitional period we will have to have access from other countries." Mr Wichmann also said that the Danes were seeking a deal that would effectively mean "business as usual" with regard to access to UK fisheries after Brexit. Mr Gove's remarks in Denmark follow an appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr show last month, when he said no foreign boats would be allowed to fish within six to 12 miles of the UK coast. But he said the UK would become an "independent coastal state" after leaving the EU, which would allow it to extend control of its waters up to 200 miles from its coastline. Mr Gove said this would allow the UK to "take control" of its waters, and then negotiate with other countries to allow them access to British fisheries. He also described the EU's common fisheries policy as an environmental disaster, and said the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future. The common fisheries policy has been extremely unpopular among Scottish fishermen, who are said to have overwhelmingly backed Brexit. Anger has generally been focused on quotas for fishing catches and on other European fleets being given equal access to fishing grounds in Scottish waters. Responding to Mr Gove's remarks, Bertie Armstrong of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said: "It is clear from our meetings with the government that control over our waters will be in our hands after Brexit. "We will be out of the Common Fisheries Policy and we will decide who fishes where and for what. Our position is straightforward: we must have first call on quota." But the SNP claimed that the "startling revelations on the Tories' true position over fisheries post-Brexit" showed that "you cannot trust the Tories to stand up for rural Scotland's interests". SNP MSP Stewart Stevenson said: "Michael Gove must immediately make absolutely clear what the UK government's real position on the future of fisheries is. "He could start by confirming that devolved powers over fisheries will transfer to Scotland so that we can get on with developing our own management policies which put Scottish fishing interests, offshore and onshore, first." A spokesman for the UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "Leaving the EU means we will take back control of our territorial waters, and for the first time in 50 years we will be able to grant fishing access for other countries on our terms. "We will allocate quotas on the basis of what is scientifically sustainable, making sure we have a healthy marine environment and profitable fishing industry."	Michael Gove has confirmed that some foreign trawlers will still have access to UK waters after Brexit.
In particular, she likes fancy china and plates, and is happy to show off her latest purchase. She ordered a platter online, and took it out of the bubble wrap excitedly. She bought that item, and some more china, toiletries and a bike, on a cashback website so she is expecting about £14 to be paid back to her. But Ms Sen might have to be patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid. Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website. It is often a percentage of the total price you paid. The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals. But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet. "I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day," she said. "But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it." Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be. "I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back," she said. She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco. It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make £262 a year. That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over £10,000. But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in. Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent. "That's the whole ethos of the site," he said. "On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out." For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal. We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before. She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money. "It's right down the bottom of the page," she said. "Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer," she added. Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites. "My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all," she said. Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board. He admitted there was "quite possibly" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website. Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products. So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home. Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately. "We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer," he pointed out. Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money. But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts. There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website. Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission. Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you. "The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you," she said. "Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account. "The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal. It's got to be the right deal or buy in the first place," she added.	Swagata Sen likes her home to look good.
The incident was reported near junction 16 at Johnstonebridge at about 14:20. Police said that six vehicles had been involved and lanes on the southbound carriageway were blocked for a time but the route was subsequently cleared. In another incident a car was reported to have ended up on its roof on the northbound carriageway. It follows a string of incidents on the motorway on Sunday in similar weather conditions. Policing units attended about 40 crashes - primarily on the A74(M) - throughout the day. A number were also reported on the A75 near Carrutherstown. "Thankfully the majority of the crashes were fairly minor in nature and as a result there were only three persons slightly injured," said a police spokesman. "The crashes occurred as a result of freak hail showers in various locations throughout the region making driving conditions hazardous. "Please remember that although it is now March and temperatures are generally higher, weather conditions are still very changeable so please take time to have a look at the weather forecast prior to your journey so that you may be better informed of the conditions ahead."	A multi-vehicle crash has taken place during a heavy hail shower on the A74(M) after a spate of incidents in similar conditions on Sunday.
Luke Bennett, 20, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago - a form of inflammatory bowel disease. After medication and steroids failed to improve his condition, he decided to undergo surgery six weeks ago. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Bennett said he wanted to help other people like him. Talking about his decision to have surgery, he said: "It was very hard. It was quite a long process really. "In my head I was thinking 'why am I going to wait until I'm really ill to go into surgery when it's inevitable?" Mr Bennett posted the picture on the Crohn's and Colitis UK Facebook page to show what "a normal person" looks like with a colostomy bag. "If you have surgery there's nothing really to worry about... it does get better," he added. Dan McClean, director of marketing at Crohn's and Colitis UK, described Luke as an "inspiration". "We are currently seeing this inflammatory bowel disease being diagnosed in about 10,000 younger people a year," he said. "To see Luke's story is very inspiring for a lot of people."	A student from Swansea University has gone viral after a selfie he took with his colostomy bag was viewed by more than one million people online.
One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
Mr Maduro said the room would be kept intact and a wing of the presidential palace turned into a monument to Mr Chavez's "Bolivarian revolution". Mr Chavez died of cancer last month. Following his death, presidential elections were called for 14 April, pitting Mr Maduro against main opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Mr Capriles says that despite Mr Maduro's attempt at portraying himself as Mr Chavez's heir, the acting president lacks the late leader's charisma. "I'm going to look after it for a few years, but it'll always be Chavez's home," Mr Maduro said referring to the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, where Venezuela's presidents have their office. Full of confidence ahead of Sunday's polls, Mr Maduro said he would "occupy a small office in Miraflores in another wing", so that Venezuelans could roam the rooms of the presidential palace and "learn how the commander had lived, and what he had eaten". Fierce battle Since Mr Chavez died on 5 March, Mr Maduro has cast himself as his natural successor in office. He has called himself "Chavez's son" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. Speaking last week at the official start of the presidential campaign in the house where Mr Chavez was born, Mr Maduro said a small bird had flown around him three times and looked at him "oddly", at which point he he had felt in his soul it was a message from Mr Chavez. "I felt its blessing, telling us: 'Today the battle begins, go for victory, you have my blessing'," Mr Maduro said. Henrique Capriles mocked Mr Maduro saying that he had "not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!" He has also questioned Mr Maduro's ability to lead the country saying that "whatever the outcome, I don't see how Nicolas Maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government". Mr Capriles has dismissed polls that suggest Mr Maduro has an unassailable lead over him. "Of course I can win," he told AFP news agency, "Maduro lacks charisma and leadership". Mr Maduro said his rival was "jealous" and promised to beat him by 10 million votes in Sunday's polls.	Venezuela's acting president Nicolas Maduro says he will turn the office where the late President Hugo Chavez worked into a museum.
Activists want to stop the consumption of dog meat at the festival in the southern city of Yulin which is due to begin later this month. Correspondents say animal rights is a growing concern in China. There have been frequent calls to treat animals more humanely. About 24 activists accompanied by their dogs handed in the petition at the representative office of Yulin city in the Chinese capital, Beijing. They unfurled banners with pictures of their pets alongside the message: "I'm not your dinner." The annual festival - due to begin on 21 June - involves the slaughter of thousands of dogs for human consumption. Figures cited by The Washington Post say about 30 million dogs are killed across Asia every year for their meat, with more than a third of that number killed in China. Opponents say many dogs are either stolen or are strays rounded up for the festival. They say many are caged in cramped conditions before being killed. Campaigning group Humane Society International has described the Yulin event as a "nightmare not a festival". Supporters of the festival argue that dog meat is good for people and eating canines is no different from consuming any other meat. In 2014, the Yulin government distanced itself from the festival, arguing it was organised by private business people and did not have official backing. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have criticised the festival along with Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actors Yang Mi and Fan Bingbing. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, the Yulin festival only began in recent years, Xinhua reported last year.	Animal rights campaigners in China have handed in a petition with 11 million signatures calling for an end to an annual dog-eating festival in the south-west of the country.
The High Court granted the adjournment after hearing a share purchase agreement was due to be completed, which meant HMRC would receive £1.4m. HMRC had applied to put the Formula 1 team, based in Enstone, Oxfordshire, in administration over unpaid tax. On Thursday, Renault confirmed it would take over Lotus. The adjournment was granted by Mr Justice Birss until 21 December, with the completion of the purchase agreement due on 16 December. He approved Lotus' application for the adjournment, which was backed by Renault Sport and not resisted, because the proposed deal was the result most likely to be of benefit to the creditors and the best chance of rescuing the business as a going concern. Other creditors, owed in excess of £2m, would be paid by 31 December, counsel Jeremy Bamford told the court. Renault first announced its intention to take over the cash-strapped team in September. HMRC brought the case against Lotus because of unpaid income tax and National Insurance contributions.	Lotus has been given a further two-week breathing space in insolvency proceedings brought by Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
The latest claim came as a female pupil, who alleged she was raped by a teacher in 1990 while attending its former junior school, spoke to the BBC. Kate, who we are not identifying, told her story to the police two years ago but the case collapsed. Gordonstoun said it was committed to assisting the police. BBC Scotland spoke to Kate, who claimed she was raped by a teacher while on a camping trip in 1990 when she was a 12-year-old pupil at Gordonstoun's prep School, Aberlour House. She eventually told her story to the police but the case collapsed after another witness withdrew her statement at the last minute. Kate, who now lives in England, has now joined a group of former pupils who are pressing for a change in Scotland's corroboration laws and asking the school to deal with the many claims of bullying and abuse. She said: "I do remember feeling very isolated, because it was the first night of the trip it happened. I just had no idea what had just happened to me. "I hold the school in great esteem but obviously there were failings at the time. "An apology is always a nice thing to hear. I know it's a different era but it would be nice to hear an apology." Police Scotland confirmed that it has been contacted by another former pupil in recent days concerning what it calls a historical matter at Gordonstoun. In a statement, Gordonstoun said: "We were shocked and saddened to hear of Kate's account of her experience at Aberlour House. "Cases of this kind must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and we are committed to managing any case of historic abuse as openly as possible, assisting the police with any inquiry and, above all, supporting victims in any way we can. "We have given the investigating police unrestricted access to the archive records we hold for Aberlour House. "We were surprised and disappointed that her case did not go to court and remain available to assist future investigations."	Another former pupil of Gordonstoun public school in Moray has contacted police over claims of historical sexual abuse, it has emerged.
The 25-year-old scored 15 goals in 54 appearances for the U's last season, but has not played a game this term. The Stags say the deal contains an option to agree a permanent move. "This is a young man who I first tried to sign when he was scoring goals in the Scottish Premier League for Dundee," manager Steve Evans told the club website.

But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined. The US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it. As news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration. But there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out. The Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football. This is not just about sport of course. The Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call "internationalisation" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa. The issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote. This time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote. "I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers," he told me. "It is our right." The Palestinians believe their case is strong. They complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games. The point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. It's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained. The match was abandoned. Palestinian territory is divided into two parts - Gaza and the West Bank. Israel controls all movement into and out of the West Bank through a series of checkpoints and it maintains strict controls at its crossing with Gaza through which players and officials have to travel to play West Bank teams. Israeli sports officials argue they have no control over the policies applied at those checkpoints by Israeli security and intelligence agencies. Mr Blatter made a trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories ahead of the Fifa Congress in what appears to have been a failed attempt to stop the issue from being pushed to a vote. Not long after he left an incident at an Israeli-controlled border crossing with Jordan illustrated the problem. The Palestinian national team was leaving through the checkpoint on its way to play an overseas fixture - it flies through Amman in Jordan, a short drive across the desert rather than from Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv. As they were leaving there were reports that one of their players, Sameh Maarabe, had been arrested by Israeli officials. Israel explained later that Maarabe had been convicted last year of using an overseas trip to smuggle money and messages back into the West Bank on behalf of the militant group Hamas. To Palestinians that's a story about the harassment of a footballer - to Israelis it's about issuing a warning about re-offending to someone who has a criminal record and who happens to be a footballer. There are other grievances too - including the presence on Occupied Palestinian Territory of teams from Jewish settlements which are allowed to play in the Israeli league. But Israel feels it has a positive story to tell about sport. There are Arab players in the Israeli national team and at most top-flight clubs - although there is an exception in that Beitar Jerusalem has often attracted criticism for the racism of its nationalist fans. Former English Premier League star Yossi Benayoun, who's arguably Israel's best-ever player, told me: "Sport is one of the only things that brings people together. In my experience I played with Muslims, Christians and any other religion and it's the same in Israel - during my time in the national team we always played with Arab players and it was the same for them. "I hope it doesn't come to this decision, because it's nothing to do with sport." For now the Israeli sports authorities have left their argument at that, but not everyone in Israel has been so diplomatic. The well-connected Israeli legal campaign group Shurat HaDin, for example, has drawn attention to Jibril Rajoub's membership of the central committee of the Fatah movement, which has an armed wing. It has found several militaristic quotes from Mr Rajoub talking about the Palestinian conflict with Israel and has written to Fifa demanding that he should be expelled, instead of the Israel Football Association (IFA). Their letter is an illustration of the fear inside football that giving in to one expulsion request is bound to trigger others - what if Ukraine should demand the suspension of Russia over the annexation of Crimea for example, when the Russians are scheduled to host the next World Cup? Within the world of sport there's always a tendency to keep difficult issues at bay by arguing that sport and politics don't mix - but of course in extreme cases they do. Both apartheid-era South Africa and the now-vanished Yugoslavia led by Slobodan Milosevic were expelled from international bodies - the Palestinian chances of success at Fifa will depend on persuading enough delegates that their case matches those precedents. Israel for now seems confident - partly because Sepp Blatter has clarified that the rules for suspension require a 75% majority, and partly because, in the words of the Israeli expert on international law Alan Baker, this is "a familiar grievance in a new forum". The dramatic arrests which overshadowed the start of the Fifa Congress may have shifted the spotlight from the Palestinian case for now but this is an issue that won't go away. Whatever happens to the proposal in 2015, there is nothing to stop the Palestinians from putting it back on football's agenda in the future.	The football bureaucrats of the world were probably expecting to make global headlines as they gathered for the Fifa Congress in Zurich.
The 53-year-old German was last seen on Saturday afternoon, when he went to cycle part of the South West coastal path between Newquay and Sennen. The search involved the coastguard helicopter, cliff teams, lifeboat crews and police. Devon and Cornwall Police said a body was recovered by the Sennen lifeboat near Land's End. A police spokesman said he was unable to confirm the identity of the dead man.	A search team looking for a missing tourist have found a man's body at the foot of cliffs in Cornwall.
The 40-year-old former New Zealand player is currently forwards coach at Clermont Auvergne and he previously held a similar position at Leinster. Gibbes will work under director of rugby Les Kiss, while current head coach Neil Doak's future is unclear. "The respect I have for Les as a coach and person was one of my main reasons for making this decision," said Gibbs. Ulster are sixth in the Pro12 table and out of the European Champions Cup in what has been a largely disappointing season. "Les sold his vision of where he wants to take Ulster over the next few years," added Gibbes. "Ulster is a team that I know well, having come up against them on a number of occasions. The Clermont-Ulster games this season gave me an insight into the strengths of the squad and it's exciting to think that I'll be part of that environment from next season." Gibbes, who joined Leinster in 2008 and won three Heineken Cups during his spell in Dublin, said: "With six years at Leinster and three at Clermont in the Top 14, I've been afforded many different experiences, working with some very talented coaches and players. "I hope to apply what I've learned to the role at Ulster and my family and I are looking forward to integrating into a strong community in Belfast." He moved to France in 2014 and was part of a coaching set-up that guided Clermont to the Top 14 and Champions Cup finals in his debut season. "Jono's CV speaks for itself and I know that he's looking forward to joining Ulster and working with the team," said Kiss, 52. "Since his retirement from playing, Jono has had an integral role in the coaching teams of two of European rugby's most successful sides. "Jono's expertise as a forwards coach is obvious, however his wealth of knowledge in other areas of the game will be really important for us." "A review of the coaching structure is ongoing ahead of next season and the appointment of Jono as head coach is the first part of that process. "A further announcement will be made in the coming weeks, which will focus on getting the right balance in our coaching team."	Jono Gibbes is to become the head coach of Pro12 side Ulster on a two-year deal in the summer.
Denise Fergus said she had been "let down so many times by the system" but that she would continue to "fight". Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of killing two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993. Mrs Fergus said she believed Venables was capable of harming other people if he was released from prison. He was recalled to prison in 2010. He had been released from prison in 2001, having served seven years of a life sentence, but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children. Mrs Fergus, speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing, said: "Do not release him. I still don't think he's capable of walking amongst other people. "He will do someone else harm. It's in him, and I strongly believe if he's released he will go on to hurt someone else." Thompson, who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention, was given a new secret identity and address. Venables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James, beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line. James' mother described it as "a stupid, silly little mistake" of hers to let go of her child's hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle. She said it "still feels so raw to this day". "I still can't understand how it happened, or why it happened." Mrs Fergus set up a charity, named after her son, to support young people who have become the victims of crime, hatred or bullying. Asked if, after 20 years, she should move on, Mrs Fergus said: "Why should I let it go? They took the most precious thing away from me. I won't let it go. And I've always said if there's a fight there to be fought, then I'll fight it for James. "If I let go of that now I will feel I've let James down.  That is something I'll never do, I'll never let James down. I want justice for James. He's never had justice." She has campaigned to have both men kept in prison, and said: "I did warn [the authorities] that one of them or both of them would go on to reoffend, and I was proven right with Venables." She said her family - her husband and three sons - mention James often. "I think the day I stop talking about him is the day I give up on life, but I'll never stop talking about him, never stop remembering him."	The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger says she still "wants justice" 20 years after her son's death.
Ronan Toolis led the excavation works at Trusty's Hill Fort at Gatehouse of Fleet. It unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of Rheged. Mr Toolis said it was "pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north" at that time. The location of Rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in Cumbria. However, Dr Christopher Bowles, co-director of the excavation work in Dumfries and Galloway, said that may not have been the case. "The new archaeological evidence from Trusty's Hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Wales were being laid," he said. "The 2012 excavations show that Trusty's Hill was likely the royal seat of Rheged, a kingdom that had Galloway as its heartland. "This was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in Scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition." Dr Bowles said the influence of the kingdom had "rippled through the history and literature of Scotland and beyond". Mr Toolis added that they had not been looking for Rheged when they started the excavations. "What drew us to Trusty's Hill were Pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where Pictish carvings are normally found," said Mr Toolis. "The Galloway Picts Project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings. "But far from validating the existence of Galloway Picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local Britons of Galloway around AD 600. "The new archaeological evidence suggests that Galloway may have been the heart of the lost Dark Age kingdom of Rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north." The two men have produced a new book which details their findings. The Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged is being launched in Gatehouse of Fleet on Saturday.	Archaeological research at a site in Galloway has suggested it may have been at the heart of a "lost kingdom" from the Dark Ages.
The presenter succeeded Jonathan Ross as host of the revamped weekly show and said leaving "wasn't an easy decision". Winkleman, who also co-hosts Saturday night show Strictly Come Dancing, said the show "simply deserves someone who can give it their all". A new series will return this autumn with the new presenter to be announced "in due course", the BBC said. Winkleman, who lists The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption as her favourite films, said: "I'm incredibly sad about leaving the film show and it wasn't an easy decision. "At this time of year I juggle all kinds of things for TV and radio and the show simply deserves someone who can give it their all." She added that she would miss film critic Danny Leigh, who presents the show alongside her, and the team behind the show. Mark Bell, BBC head of arts commissioning, said: "We've loved having Claudia on Film 2016 and I'd like to thank her for all her hard work and commitment to the show." The long-running film show, first broadcast 45 years ago, was fronted by film critic Barry Norman for 26 years. He was succeeded by Ross in 1999, who stayed at the helm for 11 years. Winkleman will still present the BBC's The Great British Sewing Bee and host a Radio 2 show. After landing the job on Strictly in 2014 when Sir Bruce Forsyth left, the mother-of-three said of her TV and radio commitments, she would "make it work". The 14th series of Strictly gets under way on Saturday evening, with Olympians, actors and singers competing for the glitterball trophy.	Claudia Winkleman has quit the BBC's movie review show, Film 2016, after six years of fronting the programme.
The rail union is calling on the Scottish government to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise. It has said making Scotland's railways safer can only be done with a publicly-owned service. ScotRail said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains and improved technology. Protests are being held at railway stations across the country. The RMT claims that Dutch firm Abellio is plundering a Â£1m-a-month profit which Scotland's railways desperately need. A Scottish government spokesman said: "Any notion excessive profits are siphoned off is quite simply a fallacy." Abellio was awarded the ScotRail franchise in 2015 for 10 years but could be stripped of the contract after five years if punctuality falls below 84.3%. ScotRail said the union's comments bore no scrutiny. It accepted that performance had dipped, but insisted it was still around 90%. Almost 20,000 people have signed a petition calling on Transport Minister Humza Yousaf to "make ScotRail bosses improve Scotland's trains or strip them of their contract". ScotRail was recently fined Â£483,000 for failing to meet required standards for trains and stations. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week indicated that stripping the company of its contract to run the railways was on the table if performance failed to improve. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT is campaigning to make Scotland's trains safer, more secure and accessible. "This can only be done with a publicly-owned service where profit isn't the main motive of the operator." He added: "RMT calls on the Scottish government to set out a timetable for bringing ScotRail under public ownership, and with the current level of anger that's reinforced in the petition there can be no excuse for the dragging of heels. "The union is available for talks with ministers to take the issues of safe staffing, investment and public ownership forwards." A ScotRail spokesman said: "These comments bear no scrutiny whatsoever. "Performance has dipped by around 1% - but is still tracking around the 90% mark - and we have a robust performance improvement plan to rectify that. "At the same time, we are investing hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains, refurbishing our existing fleet and introducing queue-busting smart technology to keep people moving." A Scottish government spokesman said: "This government has ensured profits are capped, that this cap is tighter than any previous franchise and that at least 50% of revenue above that cap is reinvested into our railways. "A manifesto commitment was made to facilitate a public sector bid for our railways and ministers remain firmly committed to this. "Currently, 89 trains out of 100 arrive within five minutes of the timetable - our contract demands 91. "That is why we asked ScotRail to implement the improvement plan which looks at addressing service-quality issues and tackling congestion, while minimising 'skip stopping', until new train fleets arrive." The spokesman added: "We fully expect ScotRail to hit their anticipated targets to lift performance. "This contract will deliver very real improvements across the term - new and better trains, improvements at stations, initiatives on fares and a revolution in the end-to-end journey experience."	The RMT union is staging a day of protests in support of "safer Scottish railways".
The incident happened on the 20:14 service, between Keith and Elgin, on Friday 16 June at about 21:20. The suspect - believed to be travelling with about seven other men - then got off the train at Elgin. He was white, about 25, and 6ft tall. He was wearing a black and white top and sunglasses. Det Con Nick Ritchie, of British Transport Police, said: "No-one has the right to treat another person like that. "We're determined to stamp out this kind of behaviour from our rail network, so please, if you know this man, let us know."

An appeal for witnesses has been made after a woman was inappropriately touched on a train travelling between Aberdeen and Inverness.
On Friday, Facebook was given 72 hours to take down the page 'Keeping our kids safe from predators', which had focused on paedophiles in Northern Ireland. The man took the case after discovering that his photograph and threatening comments were posted on the page. Facebook complied with the order, but a similar page appeared within hours. The High Court judge who ordered the removal of the original page, Mr Justice McCloskey, held that the contents of the original version amounted to prima facie harassment of the man and risked infringing his human rights. While the judge granted anonymity to the sex offender, he also stressed that the ruling does not suppress information about him or his criminal record that is already in the public domain. A detailed written version of the judge's verdict discloses further details about the man's catalogue of crimes. Known only as XY, the man at the centre of the case has a total of 15 convictions for sexual offences, all of which were committed in the 1980s. He was released after serving half his prison sentence, only to be detained for a further six months for breaching a condition of his licence. The judge who sentenced him reportedly expressed particular concern about his lack of insight into his offending. It has also been confirmed that he first offended when he was still a juvenile. When he issued the proceedings against Facebook, the man claimed harassment, misuse of private information, and a breach of his right to privacy and freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment. Mr Justice McCloskey's written judgment discloses that one of the remedies being sought is a claim for damages against Facebook Ireland Ltd. That issue has not been determined, with the ruling only on interim relief. The court heard the man suffers from ill health and fears being attacked or burnt out of his home. In a statement filed as part of his case he said: "I am in fear for my safety and in a state of constant anxiety as I believe if this material continues to be published it will only be a matter of time before the threats materialise into an attack on me or my home. "The defendants are publishing comments intended to vilify me, some of which are directly threatening. "By publishing this material about me, the defendants are providing a vehicle for others who may have criminal intent to gain information about where I live and to stir up hatred against me." Mr Justice McCloskey ruled in his favour after balancing the competing rights to privacy and freedom of expression. He pointed out that the interim injunction would cause minimal disruption to Facebook. The judge added that details about the man's name, physical appearance, criminal record and whereabouts were already in the public domain. "This information will remain in the public domain, come what may," he said. "The order of this court does not suppress publication of this information in any way. "Rather, it simply requires certain modest steps to be taken by the operator of a social networking site to ensure that, pending the substantive trial of this action, the plaintiff is not exposed to further conduct which I consider, to a high level of arguability, to be unlawful." The judge also emphasised that cases of this type will be "intensely fact-sensitive". He said: "The court is mindful of the contemporary controversy surrounding other contexts, such as online bullying of schoolchildren and the potentially appalling consequences of this gravely worrying phenomenon. "This judgement does not speak directly to other contexts. Rather, it is confined to the particular litigation context in which is it provided."	A convicted child sex offender, who won a landmark court case forcing Facebook to take down a website page monitoring paedophiles, is now seeking damages.
Third seed Murray plays Italian 25th seed Andreas Seppi in the third match on Centre Court at around 17:00 BST. Ward, ranked 110th, takes on Canada's Vasek Pospisil in the second match on court one at around 15:00. "It's great for British tennis and it's great for everyone involved that more people are winning matches and doing well," said Ward. "I've got to worry about my match. Andy worries about his." Media playback is not supported on this device Murray, 28, practised with Ward on Friday and the pair have become good friends over the past two years. "We've done a few training blocks together," said the Scot. "He stayed with me in Miami a few times. "I watch a lot of his matches online when he's playing challengers and stuff. I kind of say, 'Well done,' or let him know what I thought about the match, anything like that. See if I can help in any way." Ward is through to the last 32 of a Grand Slam for the first time and the 28-year-old Londoner has ensured he will break into the world's top 100 for the first time in the next rankings. He will face 25-year-old Pospisil, the reigning Wimbledon doubles champion, for the first time at the top level. "I know him pretty well," said Ward, who will collect at least £77,000 in prize money. "He's a good friend of mine actually. We spend a lot of time together. In the last few years, we've played a couple of times as well in the Challenger tour, a couple bigger matches in the semis and finals in the past. "We both know each other's games, so there's not too many secrets. As I say, it's a great chance for both of us." Murray has won six of his seven matches against Seppi, the only defeat coming on grass in Nottingham eight years ago. The 31-year-old Italian has reached two finals this year and beat Roger Federer at the Australian Open in January. "He has had such good results this year," said Murray. "He made the final a couple of weeks ago in Halle, plays well on the grass. "He won against Roger at the Australian Open this year. He's capable of playing some top tennis."	Andy Murray will have friend and fellow Briton James Ward for company in the third round of Wimbledon on Saturday.
Media playback is not supported on this device After an even first 30 minutes, Danny Wright tapped in from James Dayton's free-kick to put the Robins in front. But Tubbs levelled after the restart, latching onto Maxime Biamou's header and slotting in from 10 yards out. Robert Dickie headed against the bar for the Robins late on, before Deacon fired in to win the game in added time. Sutton have won just one of their past eight games in the National League - including a 6-0 home defeat by Dover on Tuesday - but Deacon's late heroics earned them a place in third round for the first time in 22 years. The U's have twice gone even further in the competition, reaching the fourth round in 1970, and again in 1989 after they famously beat First Division Coventry City in round three. They will receive £27,000 for getting through the second round, and could earn a lucrative tie with Premier League or Championship opposition when the third round draw takes place on Monday.

The charity said the new technology would provide an alternative to road ambulance journeys, offering significantly quicker transport of vulnerable babies between hospitals. The service began carrying Babypods for emergency missions in 2013. But the new incubators will attach to existing equipment in the helicopter, providing warmth and oxygen. They also have a transparent chamber, allowing babies to be monitored during flights. Welsh medics went to Switzerland to help in the design process and, at a cost of Â£70,000 each, two new incubators have been bought by NHS Wales. They will be used on Wales Air Ambulance's newest helicopter, the fourth in its fleet. Weighing 15st 10lb (100kg), the incubators will be fitted to a sled and require two people to lift them into the air ambulance. Since April 2015, helicopter crews have been joined on board by consultant doctors. Dr Dindi Gill, the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service Cymru interim director, said: "Having the incubator system will further enhance the ability of the EMRTS teams to manage neonates born at home or in hospital. "It is recognised that temperature control is extremely important to this group of patients and, therefore, we welcome the ability to carry the incubator on Wales Air Ambulance's helicopters." Following crew training, the incubator service will run as a trial to the end of 2016.	The most advanced flight incubators in the UK for sick babies will be used by Wales Air Ambulance later this month.
They have since been released but will be charged with public order offences. Holidaymakers ran and hid from presumed attackers in Platja d'Aro after people pretended to be chasing a celebrity, shouting and taking photographs. The panic turned into a stampede as bystanders mistook selfie sticks for weapons. Eleven people were treated for bruising and heart palpitations. Three were taken to hospital. Police were called to the centre of the town following reports that shots had been fired. The reports turned out to be false. Videos on social media showed children in tears as people around them cowered under tables. The German newspaper Die Welt (in German) said that about 200 people took part in the flashmob, which was organised by several Germans. Apparently those taking part were invited on social media to go down to Platja d'Aro on Tuesday evening and behave like paparazzi. The detained women, aged between 20 and 25, were in the Costa Brava town accompanying a youth group trip. The president of Catalonia tweeted that some things should not be joked about. He also praised the reaction from the town council and police.	Five German women were arrested on Tuesday night when a flashmob stunt in a northern Spanish town  sparked fears of a terrorism attack.
A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. "Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented," the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are "pervasive" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. "We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers," said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. "When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy," Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. "EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act," the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.	Security researchers have been given the green light to hunt for flaws in car software by US authorities.
Tall and like football? Go and play centre-back. Enjoy rugby union and have a bit of pace? Winger. Step forward Somerset's Dom Bess, who took 6-28 on his County Championship debut on Tuesday. How did he come to bowl off-spin? "I was always a little porker when I was younger, so I never took the long run-up," he said. "I always took five or six steps and just trotted in." Bess now has the best figures by a Somerset debutant for 55 years, since Tony Pearson returned 7-63 against Worcestershire in 1961, according to the Guardian. But any 'puppy fat' the 19-year-old may have had has long gone, with the help of strength and conditioning coach Darren Veness. "I met Daz and he made me run a lot, which I'm grateful for now," Bess told BBC Radio Bristol. "Ask Daz about me, I was always a porker." Just a month ago Bess, from Sidmouth, was taking 6-65 for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship as they lost to bottom-of-the-table Oxfordshire. At Taunton, however, his victims included Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, who have played a combined total of 170 Tests for England. His family have a strong presence in the sport, with cousins Zac and Josh also representing Devon, but who was at the County Ground to watch his moment of glory? "Dad was on holiday and mum was working, so I just had my girlfriend, her parents and a couple of my mates (watching)," he said. "I think dad will be a bit disappointed - he's gone to Greece, somewhere like that, for a week away."	Whether it comes down to skill level, body shape, or pure accident, anyone who has played a sport will have some memory of how they came to be given a particular role.
They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are "of particular interest" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their "causal connection" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been "secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine". "The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts," the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. "We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17," he added. "If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough." The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as "premature" and "counterproductive". The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down on 17 July last year in Donetsk region.	Fragments of a suspected Russian missile system have been found at the Flight MH17 crash site in Ukraine, investigators in the Netherlands say.
Gosport Borough Council says it brought in the £100 fines to combat dog mess and poorly controlled dogs. Previously walkers were allowed to walk up-to six charges, but this has been curbed with the new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). One professional dog walker said it will affect business. Nick Lower, who runs Gosport Dog Walking, said: "There are a few professional dog walkers who are going to be affected, and members of the public as well." Sue McNaughton, who will now have to walk her five huskies in two packs said: "I understand where [the council] are coming from, but they're penalising the many because of the few. "I wouldn't walk five dogs if I didn't think I could control them." Councillor Graham Burgess said: "In a densely-populated borough like Gosport, we do believe new rules are needed." Some residents are happy about the change, including Jenny Brown who said: "I'm pleased this has come into focus. I've had so many problems when encountering larger groups of dogs." Similar fines are in place in other areas including Oxford. In 2011 the council brought in fines for people walking more than four dogs after complaints of packs being out of control. Councillor John Tanner said: "With more than four dogs, you are not taking your dog out for a walk but a pack of potentially dangerous animals for a riot around the park."	Fines for people who walk more than four dogs at a time have come into force in a Hampshire town.
Mr Houchen beat Labour's Sue Jeffrey by a little over 2,000 votes after second preference votes were counted. Liberal Democrat Chris Foote Wood was third and UKIP's John Tennant finished last. Mr Houchen will have a budget of Â£15m a year. In another result, Labour retained control of Durham County Council despite losing 20 seats. The party won 94 seats in the 2013 election and that has now fallen to 74. Independent candidates have the second highest number of seats (28) followed by Liberal Democrats (14) and Conservatives (10). Council leader Simon Henig said he was "very pleased" to have retained a majority in a "challenging" election. As Tees Valley mayor, Mr Houchen will head the Tees Valley Combined Authority, made up of Darlington, Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough and Stockton councils. After the declaration at Thornaby Pavilion, Mr Houchen said: "What we have seen in recent years is fantastic trends towards the Conservatives across the Tees Valley and today is, I believe, a tipping point. "We have seen a political earthquake that's happening right here for the Conservatives across the North East. "It's the first time anybody would expect a Conservative mayor for the Tees Valley and it is the start of five genuine target seats for the Conservatives in the upcoming general election, and I genuinely believe this is a starting point for turning the Tees Valley blue." This is a sensational vote for the Conservatives. Beating Labour in the first round, we perhaps thought Labour might claw it back with second preference votes. They were counted then but actually Conservatives pulled further ahead and Ben Houchen beat Sue Jeffrey the Labour candidate in a runoff to become the Tees Valley mayor. He has now got to deliver on certain promises, one of which is to take control of Durham Tees Valley Airport and try to revive its fortunes. He talked about turning the Tees Valley blue in the general election in just over a month's time and that will be the Conservative focus now.	Conservative Ben Houchen has become the inaugural Tees Valley mayor after winning a tightly-fought contest.
Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at their London Street property. Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The court heard that when Mrs Sibery decided to confront her husband because of his erratic behaviour, the GP admitted he had been using the narcotic for two months. She told him if he did not quit his addiction, she would end his marriage to him. But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade his wife into taking what was supposed to be his final fix. The court heard how Sibery wanted his wife to experience the feeling he got when he took the heroin. However, Mrs Sibery collapsed and started having difficulties breathing. The court also heard that Sibery, who was on bail for the offence, was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems, and that he and his wife were still together. Sheriff Jarvie told Sibery that she would pass sentence on him at a hearing next month.	A drug-addicted doctor watched his wife lose consciousness and struggle for breath moments after injecting her with heroin in Edinburgh, a court has heard.
The 49-strong team for the event, which will be at London Stadium in Stratford from 14-23 July, contains 10 athletes who won gold at Rio 2016. Two-time Paralympic champion Peacock, 24, missed out on the 2015 World Championships through injury and will look to recapture the 100m title he claimed in 2013. Media playback is not supported on this device Britain won 31 medals in Doha two years ago, including 13 golds, finishing fourth in the medal table. London will be the first time the event has been held in the same city and in the same summer as the World Athletics Championships, which run from 4-13 August. Six-time world champion David Weir is not included after withdrawing from British Athletics following a fallout with coach Jenni Banks, and double T11 100m and 200m Paralympic champion Libby Clegg misses out with an injury. Cox, 26, who has multiple sclerosis, won gold medals in track cycling and athletics at Rio 2016, but has focused her training on athletics this year before her defence of her T37 100m title. Cockroft, 24, won world gold in the T34 100m, 400m and 800m two years ago, a treble she repeated in Rio last year. Whitehead, 40, can become a four-time T42 200m world champion in London, while Jo Butterfield will be given the opportunity to defend her club throw titles in the F51 and and Aled Davies his shot title in the F42 . T38 sprinter Sophie Hahn, who has cerebral palsy, can win her third individual 100m world title, despite only being 20. Paralympic champions Hollie Arnold and Aled Sion Davies are among nine athletes from Wales included.	Paralympic champions Jonnie Peacock, Hannah Cockroft, Richard Whitehead and Kadeena Cox are in the Great Britain squad for next month's World Para-Athletics Championships in London.
The 66-year-old, of Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, faces nine tax charges at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court. Prosecutors claim he had significant dealings in cattle and land and received farming grants but failed to submit tax returns for nine years. Mr Murphy denies the offences. His defence lawyers claim that their client's brother, Patrick Murphy, managed his cattle herd and farming activities. The prosecution at the three-judge, non-jury court was brought after an investigation by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). One of the judges indicated that the verdict may be delivered next Thursday, 17 December, but added it is "by no means certain". Mr Murphy was remanded on continuing bail until 17 December.	The trial of the prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard the court may deliver judgement on the case next week.
The pipe in Chester Green, Derby, burst at about 04:30 GMT on Sunday, sending water gushing along Mansfield Road. Ivy House School and Carlyle Infant School in Littleover were closed, while people in Chaddesden, Littleover and Mackworth reported brown water coming from taps. Severn Trent Water said it could take up to five days to fix the problems. Mansfield Road has been shut to traffic and bus services have been re-routed. Sarah O'Kane from Severn Trent apologised for the inconvenience and said reasons for the pipe failure would not be known until the road had been dug up. Shops and businesses on Mansfield Road are still open.	Two schools have been closed after a burst water pipe flooded the area with mud and silt.
Media playback is not supported on this device Koeman has advised midfielder James McCarthy not to join the Ireland squad after previously saying he had been "massively overloaded" by the Republic. Republic manager Martin O'Neill said this week that Koeman was "bleating" about the matter. Keane added: "Maybe Everton need to look at their own training schedule." McCarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the Republic's World Cup qualifier against Austria on Saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the Republic's qualifier wins over Georgia and Moldova last month. That angered Everton boss Koeman, who has only seen McCarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the Premier League club since then. However, Keane says he "could not care less" about Koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous Toffees manager Roberto Martinez. "Everton traditionally have always had brilliant Irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop Irish players coming to play for Ireland," said the former Manchester United midfielder. "We have had a problem previously with Martinez - I think he was slightly over the top. "Every time, we felt, the Everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from Everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. "I always felt the Everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with Koeman. I hope not. "Maybe Everton as a club need to - and it's a brilliant football club - maybe their players need to toughen up a little bit."

Media playback is not supported on this device The 21-year-old's success also guaranteed Britain a berth in the event at the Rio 2016 Olympics. The Brownlee brothers did not compete, with their focus on this year's World Series competition and the Rio Olympic test event. Benson completed the event in one hour 48 minutes 31 seconds. He was ahead of Portugal's Joao Silva (+11 seconds) and Rostyslav Pevtsov (+33secs) of Azerbaijan. After a strong swim, British team-mates Bishop (16th) and Philip Graves (46th) played a crucial role in helping Benson to the lead during the cycling phase. During the 10km run he broke free from the chasing pack and although the Leeds-based triathlete was briefly caught by Aleksandr Latin of Estonia he soon re-established his lead. "I couldn't have done it without Tom and Phil," said Benson. "It was a real team effort. It's a shame we couldn't all get medals - but getting the gold is brilliant." London 2012 gold medallist Alistair Brownlee and world title-winning brother Jonny are expected to secure further Rio Olympic places for Team GB through performances at the qualification event in Brazil in August. Benson will now hope to be included in World Series races and the Rio test event in order to enhance his prospects of a place in the squad for the Rio Olympics. Triathlon, which consisted of a 1.5km swim, 40km cycle and 10km run in the European Games, is one of three sports included in Baku 2015 which have direct qualification possibilities for next year's Olympics in Brazil.	Gordon Benson claimed Great Britain's first European Games gold medal with victory in the men's triathlon in Baku, Azerbaijan.
Saints had the better of a scrappy first-half, after Jonny Lomax crossed on the back of penalty goals apiece for both sides. Leeds pulled clear when Adam Cuthbertson added to Ryan Hall's score. Danny Richardson's try kept Saints hopes alive but Leeds held on and are now three points clear of third-placed Hull FC in the Super League table. The defeat leaves Saints a point behind Wakefield, who are fourth with four Super 8s games to play. Leeds cannot catch Castleford Tigers at the top, but are in the box seat for the second home semi-final come the top four play-offs. Headingley's impending redevelopment meant this game was to be the last for the 86-year-old roofed terrace, and it added an emotional tinge to a match that held huge significance to the race for Old Trafford. Unfortunately the pre-match festivities failed to transfer to the field, as neither side found their rhythm in a game high on drama but lacking in quality. Saints' best moment of the first half produced the game's first try when Lomax latched on to Zeb Taia's pass after James Roby put the back-rower into space. The hosts were equally disjointed but gave the crowd some cheer when a smart move to the left was finished off by Ryan Hall on his 300th club appearance. Cuthbertson bashed his way across on the back of Leeds pressure but it was never comfortable until the hooter, particularly when the lively Richardson came off the bench to step his way across the stripe with five minutes to go. Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott: "I thought we were extremely good, I've never not been proud of out players although I don't say it too much. I'm proud to be their coach tonight. "I don't know where we go the second half from, Saints were great, beating us off the deck in the first half and we never got to grips with their play-the-balls. "We rolled up our sleeves and did some hard work, we should have executed better. It was a great game of rugby league." St Helens head coach Justin Holbrook: "I couldn't be prouder of my team. Unfortunately that's two weeks in a row we've been beaten by two points. "I don't think we played poorly. We didn't have much ball in the second half, we were camped in our own half, but we got within two points away from home against a very tough side. "We just couldn't get going for one reason or another in the second half but full credit to Leeds, they played very well."

The homes are planned to be for social or mid-market rent and it is hoped they will all be completed by 2021. Glasgow City Council's executive committee also approved £20m to improve existing housing. Of this, £14m was announced last month as part of scheme to upgrade homes and make them available for social renting. The £34m four-year improvement and repair scheme is also being funded with £20m from the Scottish government. The funding to build homes is to be channelled through housing associations over the next four years. Eight sites in the area have been identified for development. As part of the strategy, Govanhill Housing Association has also committed £3.7m to new housing and repairs for the duration of the four year period. Overall this means there are plans to invest more than £44m in housing in Govanhill over the next four years. Councillor George Redmond: "This is an impressive document and points to the way ahead in Govanhill." "Significant sums are being invested in Govanhill and it is great news that part of that money will go towards new housing. "The council has been working exceptionally hard to turn things around in Govanhill and we are starting to see real progress being made." He said that while the council was keen to work with all property owners in Govanhill, he warned the council would use power of compulsory purchase against those who refused to get on board with the plans.	About 350 homes are to be built in the Govanhill area of Glasgow under a £6.4m council initiative to help "turn the area around".
The dinosaurs were able to make the journey when a spell of warming allowed passage over frozen land bridges between the continents. Two fossil discoveries in Australia shed new light on this theory. Both specimens are sauropods - a group of large, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads. Further classified as titanosaurs, they are among the largest dinosaurs ever to walk the Earth. Lead researcher Dr Stephen Poropot, of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum, said the specimens add to our knowledge of the area 95 to 98 million years ago. "We get a much better idea of the overall fauna," he said. "And as a result we can start piecing together how climate affected these dinosaurs, how the positions of the continent affected those dinosaurs and how they evolved through time as well." One of the dinosaurs was found near the town of Winton in Central West Queensland. It has been named Savannasaurus elliottorum after members of the Elliott family, who found the fossil in a pile of bones while rounding up sheep at their property. The skeleton has been pieced together from 17 pallets of bones encased in rock - a process that took 10 years. The researchers also uncovered head bones from another sauropod species Diamantinasaurus matildae. "This new Diamantinasaurus specimen has helped to fill several gaps in our knowledge of this dinosaur's skeletal anatomy," said Dr Poropat. "The braincase in particular has allowed us to refine Diamantinasaurus' position on the sauropod family tree." The two specimens have helped to show that titanosaurs were living worldwide by 100 million years ago. This became possible because of the arrangement of the continents and changes in the global climate. Prof Paul Upchurch, of University College, London, said Australia and South America were connected to Antarctica throughout much of the Cretaceous. When Savannasaurus was alive, 95 million years ago, global average temperatures were warmer than they are now, but it was quite cool at the poles. "We suspect that the ancestor of Savannasaurus was from South America, but that it could not and did not enter Australia until approximately 105 million years ago," he said. "At this time global average temperatures increased allowing sauropods to traverse landmasses at polar latitudes." The research is published in N Scientific Reports. Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.	Some of the giants of the dinosaur family may have originated in South America and crossed over Antarctica to Australia about 100 million years ago.
Luiz, 27, joined the Blues from Benfica for £21.3m in January 2011. "The move is now subject to David Luiz agreeing personal terms with PSG and passing a medical," a statement on Chelsea's official website read. The Brazilian has three years left on the five-year contract he signed at Stamford Bridge in September 2012. He said on Twitter: "Thanks CFC for this time of great partnership. I'm thankful for all! It's a new challenge and together we'll go even further. Allez Paris!" Luiz has been the subject of interest from Barcelona in the last two summers, but French champions PSG - despite recently failing Uefa's financial fair play (FFP) rules - will break the transfer record for a defender to secure his services. Luiz is not part of manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice central defensive pairing and his exit would provide funds to strengthen in other areas, especially as Chelsea themselves only narrowly complied with FFP rules. Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is among those linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. Because of FFP, Chelsea cannot afford to spend heavily on incoming players unless they recoup similar amounts from outgoings - which they could, and did, in the earlier years of owner Roman Abramovich's reign. The new financial restrictions, coupled with Mourinho's plans from a footballing perspective, are now at the forefront of the club's thinking and also explain the £37.1m sale of midfielder Juan Mata to Manchester United in January. All 12 of Luiz's goals for the Blues came in his first two-and-a-half seasons and although he played 34 games during the 2013-14 campaign, Mourinho prefers John Terry and Gary Cahill at centre-half and Luiz is not seen as a long-term option in midfield. Chelsea have high hopes for 21-year-old Czech Tomas Kalas and 19-year-old Englishman Nathaniel Chalobah as defensive options. The Blues also spent £12m on St Etienne centre-back Kurt Zouma in January.	Chelsea have agreed a deal with Paris St-Germain, worth in the region of £40m, for the sale of defender David Luiz to the French champions.
Bangladesh police are investigating the murder of an Italian aid worker who was shot on Monday, with the Islamic State group saying it is responsible. The two-Test series was due to begin in Chittagong on Friday, 9 October. "One man gets killed, an Italian, and the tour is off. We've had 50,000 people killed in Pakistan," Khan said. Khan was referring to figures estimating the number of "fatalities in terrorist violence" in Pakistan since 2003. In May, Pakistan hosted their first home full international fixture since gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team on its way to play in Lahore in 2009. "A certain amount of tension is likely through terrorism, but they have to trust the Bangladeshis, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis. We give them 100% protection," Khan added. "Some of the countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are perhaps oversensitive." Cricket Australia had initially delayed the team's scheduled departure on 28 September while it worked on a "revised security plan". But it now says that official advice means it had "no alternative but to postpone the tour". The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was "disappointed" by the decision but is "committed to rescheduling the series at a later date". On Wednesday, the BCB had promised "VVIP" treatment for the Australian team, saying they would be given the same level of security afforded to visiting heads of state. England are due to tour Bangladesh to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in October and November 2016.	Australia were "overly sensitive" to postpone their tour of Bangladesh over security concerns, says Pakistan Cricket Board president Shahryar Khan.
The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members. Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes. Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.
Dunelm House was built in the 1960s and although fans believe it to be a prime example of the architecture, it has not been given listed status. The university said the concrete structure needed repairs costing Â£14.7m and wants to demolish it. A petition calling for it to be refurbished and maintained has attracted hundreds of signatures. The building splits opinion in the city, with some residents referring to it as a "concrete carbuncle". However, architect James Perry, from the Something Concrete and Modern project, which is documenting post-war buildings, described it as "brilliant" and "incredibly polite for a modernist building". He said: "It is expensive to demolish and dispose of a building. "I would say as an architect we need to be looking to to reuse, recycle, extend or adapt our buildings rather than disposing of them because we don't like the way they look." Durham University said that if demolition went ahead then the replacement building would be of high quality and a world class design for such a sensitive location.	Campaigners have called for Durham University's "brutalist" student union building to be saved from demolition.
Bower has made 52 appearances for Warriors in all competitions since joining from Leicester Tigers in 2014. Details of the length of the 26-year-old's new contract at Sixways have not been disclosed. "He always gives everything he's got and I've been thoroughly impressed with his attitude and his performance," director of rugby Gary Gold said.	Worcester Warriors loose-head prop Ryan Bower has signed a new contract with the Premiership club.
As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power. This is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA). The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous. STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power. The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents. Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles. However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power. Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections. IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr. It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion. Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued. A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West. The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats. The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction. This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern. It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran. The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform. While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals. This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha. Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki. Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links. The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai. It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level. Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006. While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs. Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.

Paul Kohler, 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery after the attack in Kings Road, Wimbledon, on 11 August. Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 24, received 19 years each after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, and Dawid Tychon, 29, who admitted aggravated burglary, were sentenced to 13 years each. Judge Susan Tapping told Kingston Crown Court they had targeted Mr Kohler's south London home either because they were looking for items to steal or they chose the wrong address to collect a debt. All of the defendants had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol on the day of the attack, the judge said. Honc, of no fixed address, Tomaszewski, of Crusoe Road, Mitcham, south London, Pawlowicz, of Pitcairn Road, Mitcham, and Tychon, of no fixed address, are all Polish nationals. The court heard that, apart from Honc, all the other defendants had long criminal records in their home country, with 32 convictions between them. Pawlowicz had also been convicted in the UK for offences including sexual assault and affray. The court heard on the evening of the attack Mr Kohler answered the door while his wife Samantha MacArthur, daughter Eloise and her boyfriend Geraint were upstairs. Mr Kohler, head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, was held down on the floor during the five-minute attack as one of the men sat on him and repeatedly punched him in the face while another kicked him in the head, the court heard. The lecturer suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured left jawbone, a broken nose and bruising that left him "utterly unrecognisable", the court heard. He continues to have double-vision in his left eye. Two of the men ran upstairs and confronted Ms MacArthur. The couple's daughter and her boyfriend were able to call the police after they hid in a bedroom. After the hearing Mr Kohler said he felt "vindicated". "Today was the first day I saw them in the dock and I wasn't convinced they looked very remorseful," he said. "It was far more traumatic than I expected. I felt fear again seeing them, which I didn't expect to feel. In time I hope I will forgive them." He said he felt "fortunate" that with the physical injury he "can see myself getting better but I think it's been hard for my wife and my daughter, Eloise, who've had no such reminder". He said: "My wife still gets flashbacks and my daughter was in tears in court... but we're all strong characters and we're getting through." Investigating officer Det Insp Dan O'Sullivan said the level of violence used was "utterly unnecessary" and the incident had a lasting effect on Mr Kohler and his family. In his victim statement Mr Kohler also revealed the burglary had taken place a few months after he had suffered a heart attack.	Four burglars who took part in a violent raid which left a lecturer "unrecognisable" have been jailed.
The 31-year-old, from Sheffield, has received the honour for her services to athletics. Ennis-Hill, who won gold at London 2012 Olympics and silver four years later in Rio, announced her retirement from the sport in October. At the same ceremony, designer and ex-Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was made an OBE for services to fashion. More on this story and others in South Yorkshire Ennis-Hill, who received her honour from the Duke of Cambridge, will receive another World Championships gold medal after Tatyana Chernova was stripped of her 2011 world title for doping. The 2012 Olympic champion, who was accompanied by her grandparents, mother Alison Powell and husband Andy Hill at the ceremony, said: "Just to hear the national anthem in this kind of moment again is really special. "I've so many amazing memories of standing on the podium and hearing it and to be here receiving a damehood, which I never imagined I would ever receive, is an incredible honour." She added: "I've had more than I could ever imagine out of my career so I can't stand here receiving a damehood and wish for any more."	Former heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill has formally been made a dame during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.
It will be used to stage competitive cycle sports as well as recreational events, coaching and training. The Welsh Government has agreed to sign over some land near the entrance to Pembrey Country Park, meaning work can start shortly. Welsh Cycling welcomed the announcement. Chief executive Anne Adams-King said: "The development of cycling facilities in Wales is a priority for Welsh Cycling as they provide opportunities for all to cycle encouraging physical activity and progression through sport to elite performance." It is expected to make more than £25,000 a year from entrance fees and caravan and camping stays.	Work will begin on a £500,000 purpose-built cycling circuit in Carmarthenshire after a funding boost from the council.
The meeting will be attended by police officers, lawyers and Scotland's Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC. The focus will be on how leaving the EU could affect law enforcement and criminal justice in Scotland. It will also look at the possible implications for civil and family law, and commercial issues. The meeting, which will also include experts from the Scottish Universities Legal Network on Europe and the Standing Council on Europe, is due to take place in Edinburgh on 24 November. Mr Matheson said: "The UK Brexit vote raises many uncertainties for Scotland's unique justice system. "That is why I am bringing together leaders and experts to help us understand these issues - and any steps we can take now to mitigate the risks. "The cessation of EU membership and single market access would have significant and wide-ranging ramifications from a justice and legal perspective. "The issues range from tackling cross-border crime through to an individual with an EU ex-partner securing child maintenance payment, from Europol co-ordination with other countries to protecting Scots consumers' rights when buying from abroad online." It follows a court ruling that parliament must vote before the UK can start the process of leaving the EU. The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own. The justice secretary added: "The summit discussions will help inform us of risks like these - and others - as the Scottish government continues to press for full involvement in all negotiations between the UK government and the EU. "Despite the uncertainties caused by the threat of Brexit, we will continue our efforts to safeguard Scotland's communities and the integrity of our justice system, while protecting the personal and commercial interests of our families, consumers and businesses."	Justice Secretary Michael Matheson is to host a summit of experts to consider how the UK's Brexit vote could affect Scotland's justice system.
The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun. The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta). The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country. This marks the sixth arrest in the crime. Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced. "All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC. Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train. In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case. During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.	Police investigating the rape of an elderly nun in the Indian state of West Bengal say they have arrested a key suspect in the crime.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Plymouth-based 16-year-old clocked one minute 04.30 seconds in Barcelona, 0.15 secs faster than the previous best time set by Jessica Hardy in 2009. Earlier, Meilutyte had recorded 1:04.52 in qualifying, the second-fastest time in history and a new European record. In the 200m individual medley final, Sophie Allen was seventh and fellow Briton Siobhan-Marie O'Connor eighth. London 2012 Olympic champion Meilutyte will seek to win Lithuania's first ever World Championships gold medal in Tuesday's final. Media playback is not supported on this device "I'll be have a relaxing day tomorrow and will save all my energy for the final," she said. "My biggest aim is accomplished now and I'll give it my best shot in the final. Obviously, a gold medal would be a cherry on top of the ice cream." Her coach Jon Rudd said: "It feels a bit surreal, but now I remember the feeling of the Olympic gold medal because it's kind of the same. "The plan was to go for the world record tonight because we don't want to have to worry about times tomorrow - just the medal. "[Russian rival] Yuliya Efimova will push her so she'll her need to be on her toes tomorrow, but I think there's more to come." Briton O'Connor only reached the 200m individual medley final after Australian Emily Seebohm pulled out in order to concentrate on her preferred 100m backstroke event, but the 17-year-old found herself in second place at the halfway stage. However, she faded in the second half to finish eighth in a race which was won by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu. Olympic champion Ye Shiwen surprisingly only managed to come fourth. "I just need to learn how to swim it better," said O'Connor. "I keep doing that - going out too fast - and I definitely think I got a bit excited with it being a final." Compatriot Allen, 21, added: "I'm disappointed I wasn't able to make a personal best like I did in the semi-final." "It's amazing, it's so much fun and so incredible to see the youth that this sport has and that it will continue to have. It's so awesome being a part of it and being a part of this whole experience as it's happening." US Olympic champion Missy Franklin, 18, on teenage successes "If I'd have done that time again [2:10.23], I'd have been in fourth place but hopefully as it's my first major international final I'll be better in the future." Scottish Commonwealth champion Robbie Renwick qualified with the fourth quickest time of 1:46.95 heading into the final of the 200m freestyle event on Tuesday and hopes to win Britain's first medal of the championships. "I have a good lane for tomorrow night and it'll be anyone's race so I've got to get myself in a good position and really try to go for a medal," said the 25-year-old, who will face US star Ryan Lochte in the final. Chris Walker-Hebborn, 23, and Lauren Quigley, 20, both missed out on places in their respective 100m backstroke finals, but each return to compete over 200m later in the week. In the evening's other finals, Australia's Christian Sprenger claimed 100m breaststroke gold with South Africa's Cameron Van Der Burgh second and Felipe Lima of Brazil third. Victory went to Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden in the 100m butterfly ahead of Australia's Alicia Coutts and US Olympic champion Dana Vollmer. Brazilian Cesar Cielo won the 50m butterfly final. There was frustration for Britain's Ben Proud, who did not reach the final, but would have claimed bronze with the British record of 23.10 he set at last month's trials.	Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte broke the 100m breaststroke world record in the World Championship semi-finals.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must submit plans to the CMA by 20 June or face an in-depth inquiry. However, the brewing giant said it would address the CMA's concerns. "This decision by the CMA acknowledges that there are only a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished due to our acquisition of the pubs," said David Forde, managing director for Heineken UK. "We are confident we can offer the CMA suitable undertakings to satisfy their concerns." The preliminary CMA investigation concluded that the deal would not damage the chances of Heineken's competitors selling their own products, as the pubs being bought only make up 4% of the market. It also felt that it was unlikely Heineken would reduce the choice of beer and cider available in the Punch pubs, as this could lead it to lose business.	Heineken has been told to address fears that its purchase of around 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns could affect competition in some areas.
The IMF's steering committee, made up of 25 of the world's largest economies, said the global outlook was fraught because of weak trade and a series of risks including a UK exit from the EU. It urged countries to boost public spending and avoid deflation. The IMF last week made its second cut to global growth forecasts this year. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, described the talks between finance ministers and central bankers in Washington DC as "collective therapy" to deal with the gloomy prospects. But she said calmer financial markets since February had reduced the nerves at the IMF spring meeting. "There was not exactly the same level of anxiety but I think there was an equal level of concern, and a collective endeavour to identify the solution and the responses to the global economic situation," she said. The IMF now predicts global growth of 3.2% this year and 3.5% in 2017, having previously forecast 3.4% and 3.6% respectively. "Downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased since October, raising the possibility of a more generalised slowdown and a sudden pull-back of capital flows," the IMF steering committee said. It said countries' tax policies and public spending should be "as growth-friendly as possible". But it also pledged to "refrain from all forms of protectionism and competitive devaluations", amid concerns that some countries are keeping their currencies weak to boost exports.	Key countries in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have pledged to pursue "growth-friendly" policies to kickstart the slowing world economy.
Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: "I think I am not the right person for that role" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the "work" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: "Are those really African stories?". The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: "Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the "strange for Africa" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some "fabricated reality" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant.

Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of "development" aid and "human rights" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as "an enemy of Islam" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of "Negritude". With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.	Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.
The 79-year-old West Ham chairman was sent a tweet by a prankster, asking to spread awareness of a "missing" Hammers fan. Gold obliged, only for the fan to turn out to be West Ham winger Michail Antonio. Antonio, 25, cost the Hammers £7m when he arrived from Nottingham Forest on transfer deadline day - but he has made just one appearance for Slaven Bilic's team, coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 19 September. Gold has since deleted the tweet, but the prankster has pinned a screen grab to the top of his Twitter timeline. The lesson - think before you retweet.	David Gold thought he was doing a good deed, but instead was found guilty of not recognising one of his own players.
The 20-year-old, who can also play as a winger, has come through the academy at the Premier League club and played for the under-23 side in the EFL Trophy. "I'm very excited to be playing under Keith Hill, who is a great manager," he told the Dale website. "I know that he puts his trust in young players, so I feel like he'll put his trust in me and I will repay him."

Howe, nicknamed "Mr Hockey", spent most of his career with the Detroit Red Wings, winning the Stanley Cup four times. He was in the top 10 of scorers for 21 consecutive years and was named MVP six times, before finally retiring in 1980. Howe was also named an NHL All Star 23 times and was inducted into the hockey Hall of Fame in 1972. Gordie Howe died just before 08:00 on Friday at his son's home in Ohio, according to Sportsnet and CBS News. CNN reported his son Marty as confirming the news. Gordie Howe had suffered a stroke in 2014. He made his debut in 1946, played 26 NHL and six World Hockey Association seasons and held many of the scoring records until the rise of fellow Canadian-born legend Wayne Gretzky. Howe retired in 1971 but made a comeback with the Hartford Whalers in 1979-80 before finally quitting at 52.	The legendary Canadian ice hockey player, Gordie Howe, has died at the age of 88, US media say.
There was a fancy dress theme of "pirates and princesses" for the 44th Boxing Day swim from North Beach. Sea temperatures were 11 degrees - slightly warmer than the conditions for spectators. The event, organised by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association (TSSA),  is expected to raise thousands of pounds for charity. It prides itself on always going ahead, whatever the weather. Before the main event was a raft race around Goscar Rock, held in memory of Dai Rees, of Saundersfoot, who regularly took part. The challenge was won by his brothers, Adam and Richard, who came home at the head of the nine-craft fleet. Tenby's mayor Sue Lane said: "It's been a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a pleasure to see so many people turning up and in such wonderful costumes."	Hundreds of barmy bathers have been taking part in Tenby's annual festive dip.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Toffees will pay about £5m compensation for the 53-year-old Dutchman, who leaves Saints after two years in charge. Everton have been without a manager since they sacked Roberto Martinez just before the end of the 2015-16 season. It is expected Koeman's appointment will be confirmed by Friday. Listen: Saints fans feeling let down by Koeman BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast Koeman, who has been headhunted by new Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, will sign a deal reported to be worth about £6m a year. The former Netherlands international, who is on holiday, will take brother Erwin and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg with him to Goodison Park. Saints have finished seventh and sixth under Koeman - their best Premier League campaigns. Martinez promised Champions League qualification when appointed but Everton finished 11th in 2015-16, his third year at the club. In April, Saints chairman Ralph Krueger said discussions with Koeman over a new deal were progressing "in a very good direction", but added the club was "not in any real hurry". And last month the former Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona defender said he expected to stay with the Saints for the final year of his contract. Koeman made more than 763 appearances as a player, scoring 253 goals, and won the 1988 European Championship with the Netherlands. He won the European Cup - now the Champions League - with PSV Eindhoven in 1988 and Barcelona in 1992, scoring the winner for the latter against Sampdoria at Wembley. He also won four domestic league titles apiece in the Netherlands and Spain. Koeman has since managed Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton. He has won the Dutch league with both Ajax and PSV. Reaction Former Southampton and England forward Matt le Tissier said he was "disappointed" and "quite surprised" at Koeman's decision to leave, particularly with Saints playing in the Europa League next season. "He may feel he has got a better chance of winning trophies at Everton. I'd be of a slightly different opinion," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "I understand they've got a new owner and want to splash a bit of cash, but it might not be as easy a job as he thinks. "Most clubs in the Premier League are pretty wealthy now and can compete in the transfer market. We just have to move on and look to the next man to take us forward again. "The players' loyalty lies with the football club and hopefully they will kick us on again next season."	Everton have agreed a deal with Premier League rivals Southampton that paves the way for Ronald Koeman to become their new manager.
The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should "apologise to the fans". "It didn't really work for me," Horner added. "We have not really put on a show. "To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong." Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: "It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back." Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: "I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. "It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said." The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: "I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. "I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good. I felt like James Brown at the end of the lap." Vettel added: "We expected them to be stronger in qualifying, which they were. Very happy with the lap in the end so we saved a set for the race. We still have high hopes for tomorrow and it is a long year." Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz were fifth and seventh, split by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10. McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button took 12th and 13th, a huge improvement on their dismal 2015, and Briton Jolyon Palmer 14th for Renault on his grand prix debut, ahead of team-mate and former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen.

The bank had no firewall and used second-hand routers that cost $10 to connect to global financial networks. Better security and hardware would have hampered the attackers, Reuters said, quoting an official investigator. The hackers aimed to steal $1bn but made mistakes that led to the theft being spotted and stopped. A firewall would have made attempts to hack the bank more "difficult", Mohammad Shah Alam, a forensic investigator who works on the Bangladesh team investigating the theft, told Reuters. The second-hand hardware also meant that basic security steps to segregate network traffic were not taken, he said. The cheap routers have hindered the investigation, said Mr Alam, because they collected very little network data that could be used to pinpoint the hackers and shed light on their tactics. The hack took place in early February and involved hackers getting access to the core network of Bangladesh's central bank. They used this privileged access to transfer cash from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to other banks. A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted bank staff and meant the hackers only managed to steal $81m. This has been traced to accounts in the Philippines and to casinos in the same country. Most of the cash has yet to be recovered. Bank security experts said the bank should have spent more time and money protecting the network for its central bank. "You are talking about an organisation that has access to billions of dollars and they are not taking even the most basic security precautions," Jeff Wichman, a consultant with cyber firm Optiv, told Reuters.	Hackers managed to steal $80m (£56m) from Bangladesh's central bank because it skimped on network hardware and security software, reports Reuters.
Three first-half goals in the space of 10 minutes sentenced the O's to a fourth successive defeat as Crawley tasted victory for the first time in seven matches. Orient edged the opening exchanges but lost defender Tom Parkes through injury before Steven Alzate was denied on the edge of the area by keeper Glenn Morris. Crawley had failed to score in their previous three home games but leading marksman James Collins swooped to give them the lead with his 20th goal of the season midway through the half. The former Shrewsbury striker struck by heading in a free-kick from Josh Payne and, although keeper Sam Sargeant got a hand to the ball, it flew into the corner of the net. Crawley took a firm grip of the game by scoring twice in the space of four minutes before the interval. Defender Joe McNerney rose unchallenged to head home a Payne free-kick from 12 yards on 29 minutes and then, from an Andre Blackman set-piece, Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn forced the ball home. Crawley, who had won only two of their previous 13 games, threatened again when a header from skipper Jimmy Smith was saved by Sargeant shortly after the break. Boldewijn, after earlier firing wide from 25 yards, should have increased the lead when putting the ball wastefully wide from a pass by Collins. Match support supplied by the Press Association.

Finney, who earned 76 caps for his country, is considered one of the greatest players England ever produced. "The likes of Bill Shankly and Tommy Docherty idolised him," said former England defender Jimmy Armfield. Docherty, who played with Finney, said: "He was the best player I've ever seen, alongside Lionel Messi." "I watch a lot of Barcelona and when I watch Messi, I close my eyes and can see Tom. I'm serious when I say that Messi is the Tom Finney of today. "Just like Finney, Messi is always getting fouled, but doesn't complain and just gets up and gets on with the game." Finney played in three World Cups between 1950 and 1958, and is joint sixth on England's all-time scoring list with 30 goals, alongside Nat Lofthouse and Alan Shearer. "I was lucky enough to have met him when I was on loan at Preston and he was not just an England great but a true gentleman," said former England captain David Beckham. Away from the international spotlight, Finney's humble nature and reputation as one-club man endeared him to supporters everywhere. Preston born, he spent his entire 14-year career with his home-town club and wore their famous white strip over 400 times. "The two words always went together - Preston and Finney," added BBC Radio 5 live pundit Armfield. "I remember taking the FA team out to the Far East. We were out in Hong Kong and somebody asked me where I lived. I said Blackpool and they asked how do you get to Blackpool? I said, you get a train and change at Preston. As soon as I said Preston, he said 'ah, Tom Finney'. "When he finished playing, he did some reporting for a Sunday newspaper and he used to cover matches. I was playing for England at Cardiff against Wales and I got injured. "I remember [former England manager] Walter Winterbottom asking me, 'how are you going to get home?' I was hobbling and, just at that moment, Tom knocked on the door of the dressing room, came in and asked me if I'd like him to drop me off. "It hit me then. He didn't have to do that but he'd been a player and I'd played against him. No more than that." "Preston has lost its favourite son, a man who gave Prestonians pride in the place they come from. It was as though a little of the esteem and respect in which Finney was held rubbed off on all of them. "My dad always insisted that he knew him. Everyone of his generation did and so I took his words lightly. One day I was walking through the centre of town with my old man when I noticed Finney walking towards us. He looked up as our paths crossed and, with what I am sure to this day was a hint of recognition, looked my dad square in the face and wished him good morning. "Sir Tom, you will be missed." Read Paul Fletcher's tribute Finney scored 187 league goals for North End and was comfortable occupying any position across the forward line. Although team silverware eluded him as he finished as a league runner-up in 1953 and 1958, as well as a losing FA Cup finalist in 1954, he was twice named Football Writers' Player of the Year. "If Tom was injured and couldn't play, Preston would delay naming the team until after 2pm on a Saturday because the gates would halve if he wasn't on the teamsheet," added Docherty, who himself played over 300 times for the club. "If Gareth Bale is worth £100m, then Sir Tom would be worth far in excess of that in today's market. In fact, there is not enough money in football to buy him." To mark his passing, Preston's players wore black armbands and shirts with the name 'Finney' on the back - as well as their respective squad numbers - for their home draw with Leyton Orient on Saturday. "In my time as Preston manager, he used to come in on a Friday morning and he would sit there and spend the whole morning signing autographs and books," said Craig Brown, who managed the club between 2002 and 2004. "I know he cared for his late wife Elsie when she was ill and he diligently wouldn't bring in help - he wanted to do it all himself. This was a man of the utmost calibre and dignity." Howard Kendall, who would later manage Everton, joined Preston as a schoolboy shortly after Finney's retirement in 1960 and recalls guidance offered to him by the club legend. "He was so important to the Preston team that he played despite carrying injuries," said Kendall, who in 1964 became the youngest player to play in a Wembley FA Cup final at the age of 17. "One very important piece of advice he gave me was to never to do the same. He said 'it is not the number of games you play in a season that counts, it is the number of seasons you play'. "Bill Shankly once said that when it came to comparing Sir Tom with Sir Stanley Matthews, he would choose Sir Tom. When 'Shanks' said that, you had to listen." Finney was knighted in 1998 and, according to Armfield, continued to love the game. Sir Bobby Charlton, England's record goalscorer, describes Finney's contribution to English football as "immeasurable", but many former players reflect on his demeanour off the pitch as a defining characteristic. Former England midfielder Rodney Marsh, who played for Fulham, QPR and Manchester City during the 1960s and 70s, said Finney represented a different era. "He came from a time of gentleman footballers where they were always properly dressed, wore a jacket and tie and acted accordingly," he said. "They would go to the games with the fans, and we'll never see the like of that again. "I've always had the highest possible respect and esteem for Tom Finney. It was like being in the company of greatness."	Tributes have been paid to former Preston North End and England winger Tom Finney, following his death at the age of 91.

Guide dog Joey, who mainly flies between London Luton and Paphos in Cyprus, has notched up 35 flights with owner Jan Gibson and her husband Roger. Mrs Gibson, from Swindon, said: "The crew and passengers often fuss over Joey and take photos as it's not often you get to see a dog on a plane." Guide and assistance dogs are the only animals allowed on EasyJet flights. Mrs Gibson, who has had the dog for five years, said: "Joey enjoys flying and will usually sleep at my feet through most of the flight, although he does go for a walk halfway through." EasyJet group director Peter Duffy said: "With 35 flights under his collar, he must be one of the most travelled dogs in the country and we are really  pleased Joey, Jan and Roger have chosen to fly with us again and again."	A golden labrador has been named EasyJet's most frequent flying dog by the budget airline.
Latest figures show the the nursing and midwifery vacancy rate stands at 4.5% - the highest ever reported. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the current situation with unfilled posts threatened patient care. Health Secretary Shona Robison insisted staff levels within the NHS had risen to "historically high levels" under the SNP. Figures from ISD Scotland show 2,818.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts were unfilled at the end of March, a 27.5% increase from March last year. The number of such posts lying unfilled for three months or more was up 51.3% year on year to 670.6. During the same period, the NHS spent Â£8.4m more on nursing and midwifery bank and agency staff, paying out a total of Â£166.5m. Vacancies for consultants have also risen year on year from 6.5% to 7.4% and there were 415.7 vacancies, of which 203.4 have lain empty for more than three months, up 38.2 from 2016. The total number of staff working within the Scottish NHS, however, has risen 0.7% year on year to 139,430 WTE posts. Norman Provan of the RCN warned: "If there aren't the nurses, patients won't receive the care they need." He added: "These figures reflect the challenge faced by Scotland's NHS. Across both acute and community settings, there are simply too few nurses. "The Scottish government can point to the increase in the number of nursing and midwifery staff, but the reality on the ground is that nurses wanting to do their very best for patients are too often coming up against the reality of vacancies in the workforce. "Nursing morale is low and teams are struggling to recruit and retain the staff they need." Health Secretary Ms Robison said part of the increase in vacancies was due to the creation of new posts in health boards. She said: "Under this government, NHS staff numbers have risen to historically high levels, with more doctors and nursing staff now delivering care for the people of Scotland - including over 2,000 additional qualified nurses and midwives. "We're committed to training and retaining our nursing staff, and earlier this year we confirmed a 4.7% increase in trainee nurses and midwives for 2017/18 - a fifth successive rise. "We have also committed Â£450,000 over three years to reintroduce a national return to practice scheme."	Nursing leaders are warning the NHS in Scotland has "too few nurses" after vacancies rose to record levels.
The mythical ruler's legendary court has been associated with locations throughout Wales, including Carmarthen, St David's, and Cardigan. Now a retired Bangor University professor has revealed what he believes to be the true location of Camelot. And it turns out to be a small Roman fort at Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prof Peter Field, a renowned expert in Arthurian literature, said:  "It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up. "I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery." Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport, Somerset's Cadbury Castle, and Tintagel in Cornwall. In Roman times, Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum, which means "the fort of the god Camul". Over the years, well-recognised linguistic processes would have reduced Camulodunum to Camelot. Though almost forgotten and insignificant today, and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D. 500, Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold. At that time, Celtic-speaking Britons, who could have been led by King Arthur, held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons. Slack, on the Roman road from Chester to York, would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast. Prof Field added: "If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around AD500, although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180. "There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. "In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information." Prof Field, who taught at Bangor from 1964 to 2004, has been researching the location of Camelot for the past 18 months. He spoke about his findings during the official launch of Bangor University's Stephen Colclough centre for the history and culture of the book.	The quest to find King Arthur's Camelot has puzzled and intrigued scholars and fans for over a thousand years.
Labour's new leader said he wanted the weekly sessions to be less "theatrical" and Mr Cameron agreed there should be more focus on "substantial issues". Mr Corbyn asked about housing, tax credits and mental health service cuts. The BBC's Norman Smith said it was much calmer than normal but the PM had not been put under any real pressure. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg later on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted he would not campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, while vowing to fight any moves towards a more free-market relationship. Mr Corbyn was cheered by Labour MPs as he got to his feet at his first PMQs, before launching into a lengthy pre-amble in which he thanked supporters for his Labour leadership victory, vowed to make PMQs less "theatrical" and explained his decision to crowd source his questions. He said: "I thought at my first PMQs, I would do it in a slightly different way... So I sent out an email to thousands of people and asked them what questions they would like to put to the prime minister and I received 40,000 replies." The prime minster congratulated Mr Corbyn on his "resounding victory" in the Labour leadership contest and welcomed him to the frontbench. Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end "Punch and Judy" politics, then said "no one would be more delighted than me" if PMQs could become a "genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions". Mr Corbyn's first question "from a woman called Marie" was on the "chronic lack of affordable housing" and "the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords" - something the new Labour leader has said will be his top priority. Mr Cameron said the government had delivered more affordable homes but recognised "much more needs to be done". Before Mr Corbyn began his second question, on job losses at housing associations, he thanked the prime minister "for his commitment that we are going to do Prime Minister's Questions in a more adult way than it's been done in the past". He then asked about "absolutely shameful" cuts to tax credits voted through by MPs on Tuesday, on behalf of  "Paul," and about cuts to mental health services, prompted by a question from "Gail". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's verdict As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, no where to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions. What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box. Read Laura's full analysis Mr Cameron struck a consensual tone in his replies, agreeing that more needed to be done to improve mental health services, and paused to scold Labour MPs who were jeering him over his claim that the lowest paid would be Â£20 a week better off next year thanks to an increase in the minimum wage. "I thought this was the new Question Time. I'm not sure the message has fully got home," he told them. The prime minister took a couple of swipes at the new Labour leader when answering questions from backbenchers, as noise levels in the chamber returned to normal levels, although Tory MPs still appeared to be following instructions to avoid triumphalism. In response to a question on Northern Ireland from DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Mr Cameron paid tribute to former Conservative MPs Airey Neave and Ian Gow, who were murdered by Republican terrorists. He did not directly refer to controversy over Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell's previous comments on Northern Ireland, but said: "I have a simple view, which is the terrorism we faced was wrong, it was unjustifiable, the death and the killing was wrong. It was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves." He held back from attacking Mr Corbyn over his much-criticised decision not to sing the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, saying in response to a question from a Tory MP that the St Paul's Cathedral event had been "a reminder of how proud we should be of our armed forces, then, today and always." Minutes before the session began Labour sources confirmed that their leader, who believes in the abolition of the monarchy, would join in with the anthem at future official engagements. Labour denied that Mr Corbyn's new approach - asking six different questions rather than pushing the prime minister on a single point - gave Mr Cameron an easy ride. "The questions were very direct and they demanded clear answers," a Labour source said. Asked about policy differences that appear to have emerged between Mr Corbyn and his front bench, on welfare cuts and Europe, a Labour source said "lots of listening" would be done and some policies would be reviewed under the new leadership.	Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron questions emailed to him from the public as he tried what he called "a different" style for his debut PMQs.
Routine monitoring by Argyll and Bute Council discovered raised levels of algal toxins in Loch Melfort and Seil Sound. The naturally-occurring toxins were above the "legally-permitted levels for harvest". Members of the public have been asked not to gather them. The toxins accumulate in molluscs such as mussels, oysters, cockles and razor clams, and when levels breach statutory limits, harvesting of affected species is prohibited. Elsewhere, raised levels of Escheria coli (E.coli) bacteria have been identified in Oitir Mhor Bay. It follows the discovery of raised levels at Kerrera West, Loch Craignish, Kilfinichen Bay and Castle Stalker. They were discovered by the council's environmental health team as part of their work to maintain the quality of shellfish. Potential raised levels of E.coli were also found at Dunstaffnage, Kerrera East, Loch na Cille and Loch Riddon. A council spokesman said: "Eating shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters and razor fish from affected areas can pose a risk to human health. "Notices to warn the public and casual gatherers have been posted along the shore. Commercial shellfish harvesters in these areas have been contacted by the council and steps taken to postpone harvesting until bacterial levels subside. "People are advised to avoid eating shellfish from these areas until further notice as a precaution. When levels subside, the warning notices will be removed."	People have been warned not to eat shellfish in parts of Argyll and Bute after raised levels of toxins were found.
BBC Radio Solent reports Eisner has already informed manager Paul Cook of his interest in creating the role. The former Walt Disney chief executive has made an offer to buy 100% of the League Two champions. Cook is believed to want a firm input over any potential candidate to ensure minimal disruption to his set-up. Portsmouth won the League Two title on goal difference from Plymouth Argyle on the final day of the season. Cook won the title for a second time in his managerial career after leading Chesterfield to promotion in 2014. Eisner's offer of £5.67m for Portsmouth plus an additional investment of £10m in equity will be voted on by club shareholders and members of the Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST), who currently own 48%.	Portsmouth are considering appointing a director of football next season, should Michael Eisner's proposed takeover of the club go through.
The 28-year-old Scotland international has spent the last two seasons with Wasps, having previously had a six-year spell with Glasgow Warriors. "His style fits the way we play perfectly and he will provide excellent competition," said incoming Quins director of rugby John Kingston. "We are looking forward to adding his expertise next season." Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Jackson's deal at The Stoop. Jackson has won 28 caps for Scotland since making his Test debut against New Zealand in 2010, and made one appearance at this year's Six Nations. "I'm extremely excited to be starting a new challenge with Harlequins," he said. "After speaking to John Kingston and Conor O'Shea I could see how great a club it is." Kingston will replace O'Shea in charge of the south-west London club this summer, with O'Shea leaving the club to take charge of Italy.	Harlequins have agreed to sign fly-half Ruaridh Jackson from Premiership rivals Wasps ahead of next season.
The watchdog assessed the authority's services between January 16 and February 9 and found improvements since its last inspection in 2011. Inspectors said parents had told them new services, brought in over the past 18 months, were "making a difference". The council welcomed the report, but said it was "identifying areas where can do better". See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Inspectors assessed three key areas and ranked two - leadership and services for looked-after children - as "good". The third area - children who need help and protection - was rated as "requires improvement". In 2011, services in the city were ranked "adequate". In 2013 the council closed two children's centres and reopened eight others as "strengthening family hubs" and inspectors said this seemed to be a difference. "Services have been reconfigured in such a way as to bring together... family workers with health visitors, midwives and social workers," the report said. "Parents told inspectors that it is making a difference to them and their families and that, increasingly, they are able to get the right help in the right way." However, the report added the help and protection which children and young people receive requires improvement. "The quality of analysis, assessments and plans... is variable," it said. "Some children are not getting the help and support that they need quickly enough." Val Gibson, the authority's cabinet member for children and young people, said: "Inspectors have scrutinised our services in minute detail, highlighting the many areas where we are performing well, and identifying areas where we can and will do better." "We have developed a robust action plan to raise standards still further."	Children's services in Wolverhampton have been rated "good" following an inspection by Ofsted.
Mr Videgaray was seen as the main organiser of the controversial meeting between Mr Trump and President Enrique Pena Nieto. The visit was widely criticised by Mexicans both in the national press and on social media. A spokesperson for the ministry said Mr Videgaray would not take on another public office. He will be replaced by the current Minister of Social Development, Jose Antonio Meade. Mr Meade previously held the finance portfolio in 2011 and 2012. Mr Trump, the Republican nominee for the US presidency, visited Mexico briefly on 1 September, despite widespread condemnation of some of his earlier comments about Mexican migrants to the United States. He had called Mexican migrants "criminals" and "rapists". Such remarks led President Pena Nieto to compare the American to Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. Mr Videgaray has been one of the president's closest advisers, orchestrating a successful election campaign in 2012. However, Mr Trump's visit almost immediately caused public relations problems, when he appeared later that day at a rally in Arizona. There, he told the crowd Mexico would "100%" pay for a planned border wall, though he told reporters he had not discussed the issue with President Pena Nieto. The president later insisted he had told Mr Trump that Mexico would not pay. In 2014, Mr Videgaray came under fire when a newspaper investigation revealed he had bought his home from a construction firm whose parent company had won major public contracts. He denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest. President Pena Nieto said the new minister will "apply adjustments to public spending" but there will not be any rise in taxes.	Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray has resigned following the visit of Donald Trump last week.
Shortly after midday, the FTSE 100 was 37.55 points higher at 6,256.81. M&S shares sank 8% after the retailer warned of a hit to short-term profits as it attempts to revive its clothing business. New chief executive Steve Rowe says he intends to lower clothing prices and reduce the number of sales promotions. But bank shares helped to bolster the wider market, with RBS up 3.6% and HSBC 3.4% higher. Royal Mail shares rose 1% to 526.5p after regulator Ofcom said it would not impose any new price controls on the company. Ofcom said it had decided against new controls because of the declining market for letters and increasing competition for parcel deliveries. Electrical goods and mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone rose 0.5% as it pushed up its full-year profit forecast after enjoying strong sales. It now expects profits of between Â£445m and Â£450m. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.3% against the dollar to $1.4685, and was also 0.3% higher against the euro at â‚¬1.3174.	(Noon): Banking shares helped to lift the market, but shares in M&S slid after the retailer said its turnaround plan was set to hit profits.
Volkswagen (VW) shares plunged more than 18% on Monday after US regulators found that some of its cars could manipulate official emissions tests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that software in several diesel cars could deceive regulators. Volkswagen was ordered to recall half a million cars in the US on Friday. In addition to paying for the recall, VW faces fines that could add up to billions of dollars. There may also be criminal charges for VW executives. The White House in Washington also reportedly said it was "quite concerned" about VW's conduct. Volkswagen's chief executive apologised after the scandal emerged. "I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public," Martin Winterkorn said. He has launched an investigation into the software that allowed VW cars to emit less during tests than they would while driving normally. The EPA found the "defeat device" in diesel cars including the Audi A3 and the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has stopped selling the relevant diesel models in the US, where diesel cars account for about a quarter of sales. The EPA said that the fine for each vehicle that did not comply with federal clean air rules would be up to $37,500 (£24,000). With 482,000 cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations, it means the fines could reach $18bn. That would be a considerable amount, even for the company that recently overtook Toyota to be the world's top-selling vehicle maker in the first six months of the year. Its stock market value is about €66bn ($75bn; £48bn). Analysis: Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent There's one question people keep asking me at the moment. Is this the car industry's version of Libor, the scandal that rocked the financial world? It's way too early to say just yet. But the pressure is now on the car industry to prove that cheating the pollution figures isn't a widespread problem stretching across both sides of the Atlantic. The German government is investigating whether other companies are massaging their emissions data. The American regulator is widening its probe to other carmakers. If they dig up more examples, the implications could be huge. Fines running into billions. A complete loss of credibility. And worst of all, the possibility that people have become ill or even died early because of higher emissions. Americans don't tend to buy diesels. They represent just 3% of their car market. But half of all new cars sold in Europe are a diesel. Diesel cars: Is it time to switch to a cleaner fuel? VW has ordered an external investigation, although it has not revealed who will be conducting it. "We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law," Mr Winterkorn said. €14bn Wiped off VWs market cap $18bn Potential fines 482,000 Diesel cars recalled 1 Biggest selling global carmaker The scandal comes five months after former chairman Ferdinand Piech left Volkswagen following disagreements with Mr Winterkorn. "This disaster is beyond all expectations," Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Centre of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said. The VW board is due to meet on Friday to decide whether to renew the chief executive's contract until 2018, and some analysts speculated Mr Winterkorn may be on his way out. "No question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to [the chief executive] losing his job," said Prof Christian Stadler from Warwick Business School. He compared the scandal to Toyota recalling nine million cars between 2009-11. "To some extent, the cheating by Volkswagen seems more blatant, but the numbers are lower and there are no fatalities involved. "This suggests that in the heat of the moment, the long-term effect on Volkswagen may be overstated. Sure, it will hurt, but maybe not quite as bad as we expect right now." VW had been promoting its diesel cars in the US as being better for the environment. The US law firm Hagens Berman is launching a class-action suit against VW on behalf of people who bought the relevant cars. The models cited by the law firm are the diesel versions in the US of: "While Volkswagen tells consumers that its diesel cars meet California emissions standards, vehicle owners are duped into paying for vehicles that do not meet this standard and unknowingly pay more for quality they never receive," Hagens Berman alleged.	Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn will "support" the German transport ministry's investigation into the carmaker's emissions scandal.
The poll indicates satisfaction fell from 70% to 58% last year - the largest annual drop since it started in 1983. The King's Fund think tank sponsored the NHS questions put to more than 1,000 people and said their answers appeared to be a comment on reforms and spending squeezes and not care quality. The government said the survey contradicted its poll among patients. The survey formed part of the wider British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers a whole host of policy areas. When asked what they think of their care, most patients are grateful for their treatment and give the NHS a thumbs up. This is illustrated by the results of the latest annual patients survey, which reveals nine in 10 would rate their care as good, very good or excellent. Understandably, ministers have highlighted that research to suggest that all is rosy in the health service. But that does not mean that the findings of the British Social Attitudes Survey are not important. They are in effect an emotional stock-take of what the public thinks the present and future holds for the health service. The NHS - like the rest of the public sector - is facing a tough challenge. Rising demands and a squeeze on finances means the pressure is on - and this drop in satisfaction suggests the public are worried. The 1,096 respondents to the health questions were asked "how satisfied or dissatisfied"  they were with the way in which the National Health Service was run. The King's Fund released the findings on the NHS as it has taken on responsibility for funding that element of the research after the government pulled out last year. Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said the poll was important because it had tracked satisfaction over such a long period of time. "It is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze. "Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly. "This will be a concern to the government given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms." The King's Fund said it had reached that conclusion because performance measures, such as waiting times and hospital infection rates, remained low. When the figures are broken down in more detail they show similar patterns. Satisfaction fell among supporters of all three main political parties - although unsurprisingly if dropped most among Labour voters. The falls were similar when England was compared with Scotland and Wales combined. While the NHS reforms apply only to England, the King's Fund suggested there could be some "leakage" into the public consciousness elsewhere. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the survey results "clearly reflect David Cameron's disastrous decision to reorganise the NHS at a time of financial distress. Patients are beginning to see the signs of a service in distress." He said A&E waiting times over winter, reports of patients on trolleys in corridors, redundancies, and "reports of services being restricted" were "leading people to feel worried about the future of the NHS". And Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, added: "These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS." But Health Minister Simon Burns said the findings contradicted the government's own research which showed satisfaction rates remained high. In particular, he highlighted the annual patient survey which showed that 92% of patients said their experience was good, very good or excellent. "The British Social Attitudes Survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors. "By its nature it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients."	Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped by a record amount, the British Social Attitudes Survey suggests.
In a tweet, Eastleigh candidate Patricia Culligan claimed a Liberal Democrat standing in another seat "deliberately became HIV positive yet free NHS care v costly". She was referring to Paul Childs who is standing in Liverpool Riverside. He revealed he was HIV positive last week. In appearing to question the cost of treating British patients Ms Culligan went further than Nigel Farage, who has controversially said foreigners with HIV should not be treated for free by the NHS. The UKIP leader's comments during last week's TV debate were greeted with heavy criticism from some of the other leaders. He insisted it was right to "put our own people first". Patricia Culligan removed her tweet and apologised after UKIP was contacted by the BBC on Thursday evening. In a statement, the party said: "We wholeheartedly support the NHS being free at the point of access and kept publicly-funded. "We have spoken to Ms Culligan and advised her to retract the comment which seems to conflate two very separate issues." In a follow-up tweet she said she "sincerely" apologised for "any totally unintended offence" , saying she had misread a Mail Online article about Mr Childs. She added: "I have nothing but sympathy for sufferers." It is not clear though if she believes the NHS should ration or reduce treatment of British HIV sufferers. UKIP almost won the Hampshire seat of Eastleigh in a by-election in 2013. Ms Culligan was selected last September to fight it for UKIP. The Liberal Democrats said her comment was "disgusting and deeply offensive". A party spokeswoman said: "The Liberal Democrats will always stand up for the liberal British values of tolerance, generosity and decency."

UKIP's candidate in a key general election seat has been forced to apologise after she appeared to question the cost to the NHS of treating British people who are HIV positive.
They have remained flat due to rising inflation and fuel prices, according to Asda's Income Tracker. It says NI families have £105 a week discretionary income, the lowest of any UK region and well below the UK average of £202 a week. Sterling has weakened since the EU referendum, pushing inflation to 1.6%, the highest level since July 2014. The report says rising oil prices, higher inflation and a weakened pound have slowed spending power growth. Families are £7 a week better off than this time last year, despite rising prices at the pumps. The price of fuel is 10% higher than this time last year, NI households spend £28.90 a week on petrol compared to the UK average of £19.90 a week. Food prices in December were 0.8% higher than in November, but cheaper than this time last year. December also saw an increase in the cost of restaurants and hotels. But electricity and gas prices helped keep household bills down. Low interest rates mean mortgage interest payments were 6% cheaper year on year. An Asda spokesperson said: "As we begin 2017, it is clear to see that prices are at the top of customers' minds, across a range of different categories." Kay Neufeld, an economist with the Centre for Economics and Business research, said: "The question in 2017 will be whether wage growth can keep up with rising inflation. "Early indicators suggest that the over the coming months - an increase in unemployment and lower wage growth are on the cards potentially putting a dent in households' spending power," she added.	Disposable incomes in Northern Ireland are nearly half the UK average, new figures suggest.
The Shanghai Composite was down 1.2% to 4,565.25 with analysts citing a number of reasons for the drop including some brokerages tightening lending requirements on margin financing. Another wave of new share offerings due next week is also expected to remove liquidity from the market. A state-owned investment firm also said it sold shares in the top four banks. Central Huijin Investment confirmed it sold some mainland-listed shares in China's top four banks and other financial institutions, along with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). News of the sale was cited by traders as one factor behind a plunge in Chinese shares. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.3% to 27,362.82. The mainland benchmark index has surged over 140% in the past 12 months despite a slowing Chinese economy. Shares in Japan nudged higher after government data gave conflicting messages about the economy. Inflation was roughly flat in April with core consumer prices rising 0.3%, while household spending was down 1.3% from a year ago. Economists had been expecting spending to rise. However, the jobless rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in March, while industrial output rose 1% - rising for the first time in three months. The Nikkei was up 0.1% to 20,566.57. Traders say the benchmark index is taking a breather after rising for the past 10 days in its longest winning streak since 1988. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up nearly 1.2% to 5,781.5, boosted by commodity stocks. A weaker US dollar has helped copper and aluminium recover some losses, while iron ore prices held steady. Shares of heavyweight miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were up 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. South Korean shares were higher with the benchmark Kospi up 0.4% to 2,118.77. Investors appeared to ignore data that showed industrial production fell in April for a second month in a row - declining by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% after falling 0.3% in March.	Mainland China shares continued lower, falling as much as 3.5% on Friday after plunging nearly 7% a day earlier.
The 27-year-old judo athlete from Inverness was placed in an induced coma after suffering head injuries in the motorbike taxi accident on 10 May. Since being flown to a hospital in Thailand, doctors have begun the process of waking her from the coma. On Sunday, she opened her left eye and followed a light shown into it. Her family joked in a Facebook post that Ms Inglis opened her eye in shock at hearing her father, Robert, singing by her bedside. In the same message, her family added that her temperature was falling and had almost returned to normal, an indication that she was fighting infections, including pneumonia. Ms Inglis had been in Vietnam for four months teaching English to underprivileged children when the accident happened. It is understood that a long skirt she was wearing, and which she had tied up for the bike journey, became unravelled and caught in the wheel of the motorbike, pulling her off the machine and on to the road.	Commonwealth Games silver medallist Stephanie Inglis has opened an eye for the first time during her recovery from a serious accident in Vietnam.
Aiden Hughes, with an address of Balmoral Road, Bangor, posed as a teenage boy before meeting his victim in a Belfast park. During the meeting, he touched the girl over her clothes. He later admitted the charge against him. Belfast Crown Court heard Hughes had marriage problems and took to the internet to "escape the stress". A prosecution lawyer told the court that Hughes met the girl on a social networking site, while pretending to be a 14-year-old called Matt Smith. They began exchanging emails which soon became sexual. Hughes asked the girl for meetings and later told her he was 20, and not 14 as previously stated, and admitted his name was Aiden. His victim reported that he made her feel "a little bit sorry for him". A defence solicitor for Hughes said he was a young man who did an extremely stupid thing and was deeply ashamed of his actions. The judge ruled Hughes be put on the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years and also made him the subject of a ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, disqualifying him from working with children and restricting his use of the internet. On his release from prison, he will be required to live at an address approved by the authorities. The judge told Hughes the impact on the then 14-year-old could not be ignored or forgotten and that adults deliberately making contact with young children for sexual activity would not be tolerated.	A 30-year-old man, who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl he met online, has been jailed for 12 months.
Brothers Jason Russell, 28, and Darren, 26, and their friend Daniel Hughes, 36, were trekking in a remote area when the quake struck. Mr Hughes' sister, Joanne, said they arrived at Manchester Airport on Saturday and that they were very tired. They had been rescued on Thursday after an earlier attempt to find them failed. The were taken to a military base in Kathmandu to await their flight home. The whereabouts of 1,000 EU citizens remain unknown and according to a Red Cross missing persons list posted online, 28 people from Britain and Ireland remain unaccounted for. The death toll has risen to over 7,000 and the Nepalese authorities have ruled out finding more survivors.	Three Wrexham backpackers left stranded in Nepal following the earthquake have returned home, according to the sister of one of the men.
Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected. VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said. That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke. However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market. "I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. "That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK." The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions. VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result. But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation. VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception. The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year. It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.
13 April 2016 Last updated at 10:30 BST Helen Fairhead captured the charming footage of the three-year-old gorilla, called Lope, on a visit to Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire. More than one million people have watched the video on Facebook with hundreds leaving comments. The zoo's director of life sciences Dr Charlotte Macdonald said Lope's "dance" is evidence of him playing - an important aspect of young apes' behaviour.	A dancing gorilla video has gone viral with more than one million people viewing the pirouetting primate.
Calling it "the hardest decision I've ever made," an emotional Mr Key said: "I don't know what I'll do next." Mr Key, a popular leader, said it was a personal decision, and later denied media reports his wife of 32 years, Bronagh, had given him an ultimatum. He said he would not be seeking a fourth term in the 2017 election. Deputy Prime Minister Bill English is likely to take over until the National party holds a caucus to choose a new leader. Mr Key made the surprise announcement during his weekly press conference. He set a date of 12 December for the formal resignation. He said his job required great sacrifices "from those who are dearest to me" and that his children had coped with "an extraordinary level of intrusion". "All I can say is that I gave it everything I had. I have left nothing in the tank." Referring to his wife, he told radio program Newstalk: "We talked about it and she likes the concept of me being home more but there was no ultimatum." Mr Key, who was formerly at Merrill Lynch as a foreign exchange dealer, ended nine years of Labour Party rule in 2008 when he ousted Helen Clark as prime minister. He won a third term for the National Party at elections in September 2014. Opposition Labour leader Andrew Little said Mr Key "has served New Zealand generously and with dedication. I wish him and his family the best for the future". Green Party co-leader Meteria Turei also wished him well. "I fought every day against John's politics but always supported his right to be a dad and a husband first," she tweeted. Known by the local media as "Teflon John" because very little controversy has stuck to him during his time in office, Mr Key is credited with steering New Zealand through the 2008 global economic crisis and out of recession. He has sought to build closer ties with the US, taking a leading role in supporting President Barack Obama's Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) - a 12 country trade deal covering 40% of the world economy. However Donald Trump's recent victory in the US has derailed that process, with his announcement the US would be quitting the TPP on his first day in office in January. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a close political ally, said that on learning of Mr Key's resignation, he sent him a text message reading "say it ain't so, bro". Mr Turnbull said New Zealand had boxed above its weight under Mr Key's leadership, and his departure will be "a great loss to New Zealand and a great loss to the world". Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott played on their two countries' cricketing rivalry to say Mr Key had enjoyed a "fine innings". "Not many pollies retire unbeaten on a double ton," he tweeted. Australian Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: "John Key has been a good friend to Australia. I wish him and his family all the best."	John Key has announced that he will resign as prime minister of New Zealand, after eight years in the job, citing family reasons.
Wilson was airlifted to hospital from the Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania after Sage Karam's car spun and crashed in front of him on lap 179 of 200. Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a "monumentally sad day". Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman & Co, said: "Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. "As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time." A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a "loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers". His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: "Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. "He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved." An Andretti Autosport team statement said: "He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. "His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none." Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised £1.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. "I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious," he tweeted. "The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family." World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: "I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him." Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: "Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. "Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock." Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: "Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend." Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: "Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones." Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. "I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family," he said on social media.	British driver Justin Wilson has died after being struck by flying debris and suffering a serious head injury in Sunday's Pocono IndyCar 500 race.
The ECB cut its deposit rate by the minimum 0.1 percentage point to -0.3%, and extended its asset purchase program, but did not increase its monthly government bond purchases. Investors were expecting a bigger cut in the rates, analysts said. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 1.7% to 19,606.32 points. Evan Lucas, market strategist at trading firm IG said Friday's shares sell-off is because there was over-excitement and high expectations for what the ECB would deliver at its policy meeting. "I have been fully aware that last night's ECB meeting would be the biggest 'disappointment' event of the week," he wrote in a note. The six month extension of its stimulus program was seen as the bare minimum, because traders were looking for a one-year extension of the plan - or even an open-ended plan. "What the market 'wanted' versus what the market was 'going to get' were two distinctly different events," Mr Lucas said. Chinese markets followed global markets lower with Shanghai Composite index down 1% to 3,549.51, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.2% to 22,158.57. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was down 1.7% to 5,138 despite retail sales rising 0.5% in October from the month before. It was the third month of solid growth as shoppers spent big on household goods and at department stores. South Korea's Kospi index was down 0.8% to 1,978.78 points.	Asian shares opened lower following the global trend as investors reacted negatively to the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy-easing moves.
Edmund backed up two wins in qualifying with a 6-3 6-2 victory over world number 73 Garcia-Lopez in Beijing. The 21-year-old from Yorkshire, ranked 54th, goes on to face another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat John Millman 6-4 3-6 6-3. Fellow Britons Andy Murray and Johanna Konta are in action on Tuesday. Second seed Murray will play Italian Andreas Seppi in his opening match, while Konta takes on Hungary's Timea Babos as the British number one looks to maintain her hopes of a place at the season-ending WTA Finals. American Madison keys, currently three places ahead of Konta in the eighth and final qualifying position, beat Kristina Mladenovic of France 7-5 6-4 on Monday. There was an upset as China's unseeded Shuai Peng beat American sixth seed Venus Williams 7-5 6-1.	Britain's Kyle Edmund is through to the second round of the China Open following a straight-sets win over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.
Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust has 285 full-time vacancies across three sites, which cover Surrey and Berkshire. The high cost of living in the south of England is said to be a factor affecting recruitment. Each successful applicant will receive a maximum of £1,340 in subsidies. Nurses will be offered accommodation at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Frimley Park near Camberley and Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot. Marko Novosil moved from Croatia to become a nurse at Wexham Park after hearing about the incentive. "The crucial thing for coming here was the support. I realised that when I started I would get the free accommodation which helped me settle in", he said. Wexham Park Hospital matron Helen Noakes said: "Rental prices are higher in this area, which means people do struggle and the one thing that we can offer people is the free accommodation when they start. "Longer term we would look to help them find somewhere in the local area to live." Currently the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom property in Slough is £897, whereas the average for the same sort of property in Camberley is £930. The average cost for a room in both areas ranges from £500 to £550.	Nursing job applicants are being offered two months free accommodation in a bid to quell staff shortages at a hospital trust.
Sir Keir Starmer said there was a "very strong case" for the Crown Prosecution Service to make the final decision on whether to prosecute cases. Currently, police forces in England and Wales decide whether to pass a case on to the CPS after investigating a death. The CPS said cases should be referred to a prosecutor as early as possible. Department of Transport figures show 113 cyclists were killed in the UK last year. Last year a Freedom of Information request by BBC's Newsbeat found that between 2007 and 2014 there were 276 recorded incidents where a cyclist was killed in an accident involving a motor vehicle. Of these, 148 - 54% - resulted in the driver of the vehicle being charged with an offence. Of those found guilty, fewer than half went to prison. Sir Keir, now a Labour MP, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that if a death was involved and it was serious enough to have had a criminal investigation "then it really ought to go off to the CPS for the final decision". In Scotland, if evidence suggests the driver is to blame for a collision that leads to a cyclist's death, a report is to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal. But data compiled from a 2014 freedom of information request to Police Scotland suggests this happened in only a small number of cases. Cycling campaigners are calling for a change in liability - who is considered responsible for a collision - in civil cases. At the moment there is no presumption on either side. Last year, my dad Mick was killed as he cycled through central London. After three weeks in a coma, he died. At the inquest the driver said the first she realised was when she heard a noise, like something falling from the sky. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death. We had questions about how the police were investigating from very early on. Potential witnesses weren't chased as we would have liked and we felt they just didn't think about what we were going through. A year on from my dad's death we held a vigil at the spot where his crash happened. That day, the police told a journalist they would pass the case to prosecutors - which could lead to a trial. It felt like progress. But this changed just four days later when police again went straight to the journalist, saying the case was actually closed. I still want to know more about what happened on the night of my dad's crash and the only option for my family is a private prosecution. The Met Police said they followed all available lines of enquiry in this case. Rhia Favero, from the cycling charity CTC, said it supported the argument of "presumed liability" - placing the onus on the driver to demonstrate they were only partially liable for an accident. "Currently it's often on the victim to prove liability - which seems very unfair, " she said. Sir Keir said the debate over liability had been going on for some time. "You have to be very careful with this - and I certainly wouldn't want to go to strict liability where it's automatically thought one party is at fault - but we may need to start looking again at that balance," he said. How safe is cycling? A senior lawyer who has dealt with a number of cases involving cyclists said he thought it was problematic that some senior police officers have said they would not commute on a bike in the capital. Martin Porter QC said:  "They're looking at cycling as a dangerous activity. Their emphasis then, and the emphasis of some coroners, is upon whether a cyclist is wearing a crash helmet or high visibility equipment, rather than on whether the people driving in the vicinity of vulnerable road users like cyclists are taking the appropriate amount of care not to collide with them." Suzette Davenport, roads policing lead for National Police Chiefs' Council, said: "I wouldn't do that, because it's too busy, there are too many risks. "One of the things as a police officer, but also in my roads policing role, is my sense of risk is so heightened because of what we deal with on a day-to-day basis. We know there are a range of people who don't go home at the end of the day." The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has also previously said he would not cycle in London. A CPS spokeswoman said the police could make the decision to take no further action. She added: "Guidelines on early investigative advice state that specific cases, including those involving a death, should always be referred to an Area Prosecutor as early as possible." The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	The way cycling deaths are treated by police and prosecutors may need to change, the former Director of Public Prosecutions has said.
They trailed by seven at the break as Rob Kearney, Josh van der Flier and Zane Kirchner crossed to cancel out scores from Seymour and Tim Swinson. Scotland winger Seymour then lacerated Leinster with three predatory strikes after the break. The bonus-point win sees Warriors level on points with Pro12 leaders Ospreys. This was a compelling shoot-out between two Pro12 heavyweights who have fought some thunderous bouts in the recent past. The defending was often porous - Glasgow's missed tackle count hitting double figures, while Leinster were manipulated by the speed and variety of the Warriors attack. When the opening try came, it was textbook Glasgow. After punishing carries from Jonny Gray and then Leonardo Sarto took the Warriors into the Leinster 22, the ball was swept to the opposite wing, with Sam Johnson zipping a sumptuous pass for Seymour to scamper in at the corner. Co-captain Henry Pyrgos missed the conversion, and the rest of the half belonged chiefly to the Irish province. Their pack were heaved into touch as they rumbled towards the freshly painted whitewash but it was a temporary reprieve for Glasgow, reliant on last-ditch breakdown scrapping with the visitors repeatedly puncturing their midfield. Eventually they crumbled, the Ireland full-back, Rob Kearney, scything through two missed tackles and finishing well at the corner, young pivot Joey Carbery converting magnificently from the touchline. The response from Glasgow was immediate and resounding. Swinson capped a spell of rapid, aggressive phase play, neatly orchestrated by Pete Horne at fly-half, by driving over between the posts, Pyrgos converting, barely two minutes after Kearney's try. Back surged Leinster and Sarto was dispatched to the sin-bin for infringing metres from his own line. It culminated in a comically simple try for Van der Flier as the flanker scooped up the ball from the ruck and exploited the lack of any discernible fringe defence, shrugging off Simone Favaro's lunge and sprinting under the posts, Carbery again adding the conversion. Then, with the clock red, Leinster pounced again, Kirchner gathering Carbery's delicate crosskick on the bounce and racing in for an unconverted score and a seven-point half-time lead. That advantage was bolstered by Carbery's penalty four minutes into the second period as Glasgow struggled to exit cleanly from their own half. However, if the first 40 minutes belonged to Leinster, the second was sole property of Seymour as the Pro12's hottest finisher produced an irrepressible combination of speed, power and opportunism to turn the game on its head. First, he plucked Carbery's pass from the air to dot down under the posts for Pyrgos to convert. Then, a minute later, he seized on another loose Leinster pass to spin out of a tackle and out-pace the chasing defence to the line. With Pyrgos' conversion, suddenly the Warriors led. Carbery cut the deficit to a point with a penalty just after the hour, but it was Seymour who had the emphatic final word. From a scrummage deep in the Leinster 22, he fizzed brilliantly on to Pyrgos' inside flick, the winger's momentum carrying him towards a remarkable fourth try - his sixth in two matches - and an easy conversion for his co-captain. A dynamic and fitting climax as Glasgow followed last week's rout of defending champions Connacht with this high-octane defeat of the early title favourites. Glasgow Warriors: Hogg, Sarto, Dunbar, Johnson, Seymour, Horne, Pyrgos, Reid, Brown, Puafisi, Swinson, Gray, Harley, Favaro, Wilson.

The Taylors will, we are assured, make "quite an entrance" when they arrive in Albert Square this summer, giving the resident Walfordians "a rude awakening". EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor describes them as "noisy and brash" who "lack cash" but "have love and warmth in spades". The announcement has split opinion among fans on the soap's Facebook page, with some worried they are a stereotypical white working-class family and/or a pale imitation of the Millers. Others have said there should be more ethnic minority families instead, or have questioned whether they would be able to afford to live in the East End these days. But some are looking forward to what O'Connor described as their "explosive" impact on Walford life. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The 27-year-old Commonwealth Games silver medallist was badly injured in a motorbike taxi accident in Vietnam. Earlier this week she was flown back to Scotland and is in hospital in Edinburgh. In a Facebook message posted by a friend, Stephanie also said "can't wait to get home and have a Nando's". On Thursday, her parents said she had opened and her eyes and said "Hi". In a further update, on the SaveSteph facebook page, a friend said the judo star had made "outstanding progress" and was eating and drinking small amounts by herself and fully able to communicate. "Hopefully next week she will be moved to a rehab centre and continue her progress," the statement said. In her message dictated to her friend, Stephanie said: "Tell everyone thank you for all their support and well wishes, I am going to be up and about before you know it and come and see everyone and can't wait to get home and have a Nando's. "Thanks everyone for the cards flowers and trinkets that you have sent." The 27-year-old, who grew up in the Highlands but has been living in Dunfermline, was flown back to Scotland from Thailand after being treated in a Bangkok hospital for a serious head injury and also infections, including pneumonia. Doctors in Vietnam had given her a 1% chance of surviving her injuries. Her parents, who live in Daviot, near Inverness, flew to south-east Asia to be with their daughter. Stephanie, who won her Commonwealth Games medal at Glasgow 2014, had been in Vietnam for about four months, teaching underprivileged children, when the motorcycle accident happened last month. Her skirt is believed to have become unravelled and caught in the wheel. Friends and family set up a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her medical costs after it emerged her travel insurance was not valid because she had been in the country more than 31 days.	Scots judo star Stephanie Inglis has thanked her supporters and said she hopes to be "up and about" soon.
Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in the restive Balochistan province and accused of "espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan". Last month a top UN court told Pakistan not to execute Mr Jadhav until it had time to hear a case brought by India. India dismissed the mercy petition and a "confessional video" by Mr Jadhav. Pakistan on Thursday released a statement that said Mr Jadhav had sought "forgiveness for his actions" and had "requested the Chief of Army Staff to spare his life on compassionate grounds". India, which denies Mr Jadhav is a spy, has dismissed Pakistan's statement and a second "confessional" video by Mr Jadhav saying, "India expects Pakistan to desist from attempting to influence the proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case through false propaganda". "The developments bring out once again the lack of transparency and farcical nature of proceedings against Jadhav on concocted charges, continued violation of his legal and consular rights and an attempt to introduce prejudice in the proceedings in the ICJ," external affairs ministry spokesperson Gopal Baglay told reporters on Thursday. Last month India argued in the ICJ that Pakistan violated international laws by not allowing it access to Mr Jadhav since he was arrested in Balochistan in March 2016. Meanwhile, there are differing accounts of how and where Mr Jadhav was detained. Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran. The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats, and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.	A former Indian navy officer who has been sentenced to death on charges of spying in Pakistan has filed a mercy petition, the Pakistan military says.
Guiseley hit the front spectacularly when Kevan Hurst swung in a corner to the edge of the box and John Rooney volleyed in past a stunned Nathan Ashmore. Ebbsfleet staged a dramatic second-half turnaround in the space of three minutes. Full-back Luke Coulson cut back for Myles Weston to place into the net and, shortly after, Darren McQueen beat the offside trap to silence the home fans.

The German was 0.207 seconds quicker than Williams driver Valtteri Bottas. There was encouragement for struggling McLaren-Honda as Fernando Alonso set the third best time, albeit 1.7secs slower than Rosberg on the same tyres. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth, 1.8secs off Rosberg but on a tyre calculated to be 0.8secs a lap slower. Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat was fifth quickest, on the same 'soft' tyre that Rosberg and Alonso used, 0.2secs slower than the McLaren. World champion Lewis Hamilton drove in the afternoon as Mercedes continued their policy of using both race drivers in one day to avoid over-exerting them, as a result of the high mileage the team are covering. But Hamilton concentrated on a race-simulation run and did not record a representative one-off flying lap, setting the sixth quickest time on the same type of medium tyres used by Raikkonen. Sauber's 2016 car ran for the first time and Felipe Nasr was ninth fastest, 2.5secs off the pace. It is notoriously difficult to predict form from pre-season testing times because the teams do no release crucial data about the specifications in which their cars are running, such as fuel load, engine mode and so on. But all the indications so far are that Mercedes are again in the best shape before the start of the season in Australia on 18-20 March, with a car that is both fast and running with metronomic consistency. Ferrari, expected to be their closest rivals, did not show anything like equivalent pace, and nor have they enjoyed the same level of reliability. Raikkonen lost all but one hour of the afternoon on Tuesday after stopping out on track when the car became stuck in eighth gear. But Rosberg said on Tuesday: "It's very close between Ferrari and us - and another team might be there as well." Raikkonen's best time was set on the medium tyre - but that still means the Ferrari was a second off the Mercedes' pace assuming the cars were on similar fuel loads. The identity of the other team Rosberg is referring to was not clear - but the main candidates are Force India, Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso. Bottas' flying laps on Tuesday suggested that Williams are there or thereabouts at the head of the mix behind Mercedes, as they have been since they switched to the German engines in 2014. The Finn was 0.763secs off Rosberg when both used the soft tyre and 0.207secs when using the ultra-soft, which is reckoned to be about 1.2-1.3secs faster than the soft. "At the moment it looks like [Mercedes] are in a really strong position," he said. "Quite tricky for anyone to challenge them at the beginning of the season." Meanwhile, Alonso's pace on Tuesday was the first clear evidence that McLaren's engine partner Honda has indeed made a significant step forward with its engine over the winter. McLaren are running this week the definitive 2016 engine, although there are still updates to be added before the first race. As with all manufacturers, Honda will also be able to improve the engine through the season as in-season development, within certain restrictions, has been allowed. Toro Rosso, who ran the car in its definitive 2016 livery for the first time on Tuesday, have also been tipped as dark horses. The Red Bull junior team say they believe they can score podium finishes this season following switch from Renault to Ferrari power, albeit a 2015-specification engine. The new US-based Haas team ran very impressively during the first test, but they were hit by reliability gremlins on Tuesday, and Esteban Gutierrez was consigned to the garage for much of the day. Fastest times: 1 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 1:23.022 2 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Williams 1:23.229 3 Fernando Alonso (Spa) McLaren 1:24.735 4 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:24.836 5 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Red Bull 1:25.049 6 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1:25.051 7 Max Verstappen (Ned) Toro Rosso 1:25.176 8 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Force India 1:25.336 9 Felipe Nasr (Brz) Sauber 1:25.493 10 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Renault 1:25.760 11 Esteban Gutierrez (Mex) Haas 1:26.661 12 Rio Haryanto (Idn) Manor 1:27.699 Bottas set best time on ultra-soft tyres; Rosberg, Alonso, Kvyat, Verstappen, Magnussen, Hulkenberg, Nasr and Haryanto set best times on soft tyre; all others on medium	Nico Rosberg set the pace as world champions Mercedes continued their ominous form on the first day of the final Formula 1 pre-season test.
At second glance, you think: "It's a statue." At third glance, you notice the holes in the feet - where the nails went in that nailed him to the cross. Jesus, the Homeless, is a life-size bronze statue that has divided opinion in America and England. Some people love the Banksy feel of it - the sense of art for the people, reaching out to the individual on street corners and parks. Others consider it an insult to the figure of Christ Jesus - leaving him out in the rain. They considered it "insulting" and "demeaning". It is the work of Canadian sculptor Tim Schmalz, inspired by a glance sideways as he drove along a busy street in Toronto. "I was driving into the biggest city in Canada and along the biggest street. I turned and saw a human form shrouded in blankets in the middle of the day," he said. "It just shocked me. In that initial moment my experience was of seeing Jesus there." The image stayed with him and he went home and created Jesus the Homeless. Now, he is setting about finding him a home and Belfast is on his list. An anonymous Episcopalian benefactor is funding 12 casts of the statue to go to big cities across the world, free of charge. Rome is one destination and London is another. But Schmalz has a special place in his heart for Ireland. A man who was sleeping rough died of hypothermia on the streets of Dublin, close to the Irish parliament in early December. Now the Irish Times is working with the sculptor on a suitable place for the statue. People have been invited to offer their suggestions. But Belfast, too, is a possibility. Fr Michael Sheehan who is the administrator of St Patrick's Church in the city's Donegall Street said the sculpture is "unique and inspiring". "You walk past people sleeping in doorsteps and on park benches. The marks of the two nails on the feet remind us that Christ is present. "So if you are passing Jesus the Homeless, hopefully you will be reminded that there are others who are in need." The church would be happy to have it - if the fine details and agreement are reached. "We have a perfect place for it, between the old church and the old school, the space is open to people coming and going. "It is a reminder that we are called to serve the homeless and to recognise Christ in each other." That goes for parading too, said Fr Sheehan. The street outside St Patrick's became a flashpoint during Orange Order parades in 2012. This statue would help people to recognise the Christ in each other, Fr Sheehan said. Also, as the church prepares to celebrate 200 years since its foundation, 2015 would be a perfect year to host Jesus the Homeless, he said. Tim Schmalz defines himself as a Christian sculptor. In his studio, in the countryside outside Toronto, he works while recordings of the St James' Bible play in the background. He did not grow up in a religious family, but became committed to Catholicism at 18 and, at one stage, considered becoming a priest. He did not do so but nevertheless considers that his art and his beliefs go hand-in-hand. Now he is married with children and works as a sculptor in the countryside outside Toronto. His work is indelibly bound to his faith. He had a clear plan of what he wanted for Jesus the Homeless. "I wanted to make visible what was invisible. Those people [the homeless] are very much invisible, there is no eye contact, no acknowledgement," he said. In his statue, the face of Jesus is shrouded, but the feet, a very private part of a person, are bare.  The statue offers that epiphany moment - when you realise who is depicted. Sometimes, the dawning is slow. In North Carolina, a woman called the police on Jesus as what she saw was a homeless person lying out on a park bench. Some people hate the statue.  They object to the depiction of Jesus as a tramp. Their criticism is that Jesus is not a helpless person who needs help. He is the one who gives help. Others say Jesus should never be represented as a beggar. But some people love the humanity and the echoes of the gospel that reverberate in the bronze:  "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brethren, that you do onto me". Among those who appeared to love it is Pope Francis.  Schmalz presented him with a scale model of his statue at an audience in the Vatican. The Pope stopped, laid a hand on the statue, closed his eyes, and prayed. There are plans for a bronze to be placed on the Via della Conciliazione, the great approach to the Vatican. "It is going to be at a spot close to where a homeless woman died. She was very well loved in that community," said Schmalz. In London, the offer of the sculpture was turned down by St Martin-in-the-Fields because of a rule banning anyone from sleeping or lying down inside the church. According to the Anglican Church Times, it was felt that given their rule, accepting the statue could leave the church open to ridicule. There was also a belief that the sculpture objectified the homeless. Schmalz begged to differ. Now, he said, there is the possibility for the statue to be placed outside the Methodist Central Hall Westminster close to the Houses of Parliament. He would be happy with that. There was a period of time when Schmalz did not know where his statue would go. "It sat in a crate for year and I thought about the irony of Jesus the Homeless being homeless," he shrugged. But that has changed. In January, Schmalz hopes to travel to Ireland to find suitable locations for his bronze. Belfast has a place in his heart and he is always open to suggestions for suitable places. "This is my perspective; If we can use this sculpture to introduce peace and understanding in Belfast, let's try our best, I am game," he said. On his park bench sculpture, there is a small space - just enough, at a tight squeeze, for one person to sit. "I made it that way," said Schmalz. "I deliberately left a little bit of the bench so that you can sit, uncomfortably, beside it." He would like as many people as possible to sit there and think. "The power of Christianity is my inspiration," he said. "Jesus the homeless is my frozen sermon."	At first glance, you see someone huddled in blankets and clutching at sleep on a cold park bench.
The Tigers trailed 12-4 at the break after tries from Mark Percival and Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook. However, Cas, for whom debutant Kieran Gill scored in the first half, reduced the deficit through Mike McMeeken. Tom Holmes crossed to secure a seventh straight victory for Daryl Powell's side. Second-placed Salford Red Devils were beaten 34-24 at home by Wakefield. Powell, whose side played three games in nine days last week, made several changes, following the lead of other Super League coaches this weekend as he described their schedule as "a nonsense" and "appalling". In contrast, Saints, who went into the game after a nine-day rest, will be disappointed they did not do more with the pressure they had at the start of the second half when leading by eight points. Cas return to action with a home game against struggling Warrington next Sunday, while Saints host improving Widnes on Friday. Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "It's one of the biggest wins I've been involved in. "For a team that had been played about with to roll into a game against opposition that had a significant rest period on us and a full-strength team and come out with that kind of performance was awesome. "We had to dig in right at the end and the amount of scrambled tackles to keep them out shows the character we've got. "What we've become as a club is we've got genuine depth and belief that we've got something special here." St Helens coach Justin Holbrook: "We knew it was going to be a tough game and it would have been great to win. To fall just short is very disappointing. "Castleford obviously weren't at full strength but they haven't lost here for a reason. They're a very good footy side and they showed that again today. "But it was a missed opportunity. They had the luxury to rest a few today because of where they are sitting in the table and they earned that. "For us to fall just short, it's really costly for where we're sitting in the table. "It was disappointing we didn't get the win but I'm really happy with the squad and we came really close today. It's important we just move on to next week." Castleford: Eden; Gill, Webster, Monaghan, Minikin; Roberts, T Holmes; Lynch, McShane, Massey, Foster, Larroyer, Sene-Lefao. Replacements: McMeeken, Moors, Hitchcox, Trueman. St Helens: Makinson; Swift, Morgan, Percival, Grace; Lomax, Smith; Walmsley, Roby, Amor, Taia, Wilkin, Knowles. Replacements: Lee, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Douglas, Thompson. Referee: Chris Campbell (RFL).	Castleford Tigers came from behind to beat St Helens at The Jungle and extend their lead at the top of Super League to four points.
The 31-year-old Falcons academy graduate won three Premiership titles with Leicester in his nine years away from Kingston Park. Flood, who has been capped 60 times by England, said: "When the opportunity came on to the table, it didn't take long for me to make the decision. "It really feels like I'm coming home, and I've watched a fair amount of Newcastle's games in recent months." Falcons, who have now made 10 signings for the 2017-18 season, did not disclose the length of Flood's contract. Flood, who made his Premiership debut for Newcastle in 2005, spent six season with Leicester where he went on to become club captain. He has spent the past three seasons in the French top flight with Toulouse. Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards said: "Toby is a proven performer at the very top level, he is a local lad and it is a huge boost for us to be able to add a player of his quality to our squad. "He has vast leadership experience, he will bring an extra dimension to our game and this really is a signing which outlines the ambition we have to rise even further up the Premiership table." Newcastle won their final match of the Premiership season on Saturday, beating relegated Bristol 39-27 to finish eighth in the table. "We have quality players coming through our academy and a number of major new signings joining us," Richards added. "All the signs are really positive for next season and it is a hugely exciting time to be involved with the club."	Newcastle have re-signed fly-half Toby Flood from French side Toulouse.
The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement. The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added. The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual". Africa Live: More on this and other stories The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US: Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual. "It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do." The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube. The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground. Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.	A seven-year-old girl has died after being hit by a stone thrown by an elephant from its enclosure at Rabat Zoo in Morocco.
Lee, who died last year, is revered by Singaporeans, while his children are respected members of the establishment. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister. The family had presented a united front, but that cracked in recent days when Lee Wei Ling, a prominent doctor and newspaper columnist, publicly objected to what she saw as excess in the one-year commemorations. She also accused the government - led by her brother - of exploiting his legacy for its own gain, which Prime Minister Lee has rebutted. The exchange has shocked Singaporeans - public disputes among the establishment in this tightly controlled city are extremely rare, let alone one involving the country's equivalent of the royal family or the Kennedys. It has also fed into ongoing discussions on the tricky issue of how best to remember Lee Kuan Yew, a beloved idol who hated being one. Lee's death on 23 March last year prompted a massive outpouring of grief among Singaporeans who queued for hours to pay their respects, surprising even government officials. At least 100 events were organised for the one-year anniversary, ranging from solemn ceremonies and a candlelight vigil to tree-planting and kayaking events. Wax statues of Lee - widely known as LKY - and his wife were put on public display with flowers laid at their feet, a schoolbook teaching Lee's values was launched, while some ardent fans online even claimed to have seen his face in the clouds. Two days after the anniversary, amid unease in some quarters about the commemoration's intensity, Ms Lee posted a disapproving piece on Facebook arguing that her father would have objected. "Any veneration could have the opposite effect and lead future generations of Singaporeans to think that my father's actions were motivated by his desire for fame, or creation of a dynasty. He strove hard and determinedly in life to advance Singapore, and not for his place in history, or leaving a great legacy," she wrote. She later accused the government of wanting to "glorify my father", and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited. The paper, The Straits Times, strongly denied her claims of censorship. In a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper's editors, she wrote that her brother "has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after LKY died... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty, LKY's daughter will not allow LKY's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son." One Sunday, the prime minister  released a statement saying her accusations were "completely untrue", adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities "were generally appropriate". In Singapore, Lee's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name, and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine. In a 1984 interview, Lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in Singapore, saying: "The danger... is that when the leader dies, you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another." The Lee siblings' squabble has divided public opinions, with many taking to their Facebook pages to weigh in. Some agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful. "If he doesn't want to be hero worshipped then we shouldn't no matter what Singaporeans want. LKY has already given a lot to us. Let him rest in peace," said commenter Mohammad Nizam Abdul Kadir. "The best way we can remember him is to continue as a united, multi-racial, progressive country. Uphold his values and principles," said another called Mano Sabnani. But others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens, many of whom still feel a personal connection to Lee. "I am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to Singapore. I would humbly ask Ms Lee Wei Ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too," said Daniel Ng. Carol Sim said: "Ms Lee has failed to understand that LKY does not belong to her alone. He belongs to the people of Singapore. We respect your choice to remember your father in your own quiet way but you certainly cannot stop the people from wanting to do more."	A rare spat among Singapore's first family has left citizens agog and fuelled debate on how the city-state's founding father Lee Kuan Yew should be remembered.
Morgan Owen, from Buckley, Flintshire, died after being restrained on 5 December. He had also been stunned with a Taser by police two days earlier. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) backed North Wales Police's actions. An inquest jury concluded the death was accidental through taking cocaine. The inquest in Abergele, Conwy county, heard Mr Owen, 24, suffered cardiac arrest as a result of taking the drug. He was found to have "toxic" levels of cocaine in his body. He collapsed shortly after being held by members of the public because he was kicking cars as he made his way along Farm Road. Police were called and Mr Owen was handcuffed but officers noticed almost immediately he had no pulse and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The inquest focused on the attitude of the officers towards him. Officers had also been called to other incidents in the days before Mr Owen's death including the one where the Taser was used. The jury was told of concerns that more was not done to respond to his mental state and questions were raised about whether he was treated appropriately given the behaviour he was demonstrating. The IPCC investigation looked at a number of complaints from Mr Owen's family about the police handling of the incidents. It found where police used force, including deploying the Taser, it was necessary and appropriate. It added police had taken steps to assist Mr Owen's welfare and to protect others and tried along with a member of the public to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived. IPCC Commissioner Jan Williams said: "Ultimately this was a very sad series of incidents. "Our investigation found that North Wales Police officers did act in a proportionate and reasonable way in their interactions with Morgan."	Action taken by police on a soldier who died after being handcuffed during a disturbance was "reasonable and proportionate", an investigation found.
The man, in his 30s, was found just after 05:00 on Wednesday lying on the ground between Talisman Rise and Templar Rise in Dedridge, Livingston. He had sustained a "significant" head injury and was taken by ambulance to St John's Hospital in Livingston. Police Scotland said the man remains in a stable condition. DC Iain Duncan, of Police Scotland, said: "At this stage of inquiry we do not know what has happened to this man and we are now working to ascertain the full set of circumstances. "Today, I urge anyone who was in the area between midnight and 6am on Wednesday and who has information relevant to our investigation to please come forward immediately."	Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was found with a serious head injury on a path in West Lothian.
The area, which accounts for 21% of all second-home ownership in England, is to get £19.1m of the £60m annual fund. The money will be distributed to "community-led" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing. Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991. The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices. It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years. In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that £60m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on "community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities". The Department for Communities and Local Government said the £60m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem. It announced that the South West is set to get £19,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly. The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, £11,336,157. The East of England will get £8.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside £6.4m and the North-West nearly £6m. Friday's breakdown also includes £2.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (£2.7m). West Midlands (£1.9m) and north-east England (£1.3m). In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills.. Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: "We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall." Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: "The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community. "This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone." During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas. It "must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people" during the second year. But Labour's Mr Healey said: "Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991. "After six years of failure on housing, people want to see government ministers get to grips with the country's housing crisis not produce more press releases." Councillor Martin Tett, for the Local Government Association, LGA housing spokesman, said there must be a "renaissance in house building by councils" to provide enough affordable homes to rent and buy: "This means powers and funding [being] given to councils to replace sold homes and reinvest in building more of the genuinely affordable homes our communities desperately need."	The South-West has been awarded the largest share of a fund raised through extra stamp duty on second homes to help first-time buyers in England.
The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of "a true son of Limerick", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: "He was the absolute governor." A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: "He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. "All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. "And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. "Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something." Evans described Sir Terry as his "radio dad" and said that Radio 2 was "in disbelief and shock". "He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio," added Evans. "He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that." BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry "one of the greatest broadcasters of our age". "Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish," he said. "You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. "But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them." Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a "wonderful human being". "I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour," he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was "stunned" at the news and that his condolences were "very much with Helen and the family". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family "after a short but brave battle with cancer", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: "Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. "The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family." President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was "always proud of his origins in Limerick", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was "shocked" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had "put it out that he had a bad back". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. "I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. "For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan," he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or "Terry's Old Geezers and Gals". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: "He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family." Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was "one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a "radio genius", saying: "The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone." Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: "Such a special and funny man. "A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter." Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: "He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. "He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it." Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: "The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. "When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine." Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.	Books of condolence have opened for Sir Terry Wogan, as his breakfast show successor Chris Evans paid tribute on air to "radio's Eric Morecambe".
Media playback is not supported on this device The 24-year-old missed the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction last month in order to concentrate on his international future. Vince has played three T20 matches so far for England, scoring 125 runs, with a strike-rate of 119.04. "If it's a platform to go on and play other formats for England, then that'll be ideal," he told BBC South Today. "First and foremost, I'm going to try and help England win the World Cup and try to learn off some very good players when I am out there. "It will be a good experience and one I cannot wait to start." County team-mates Liam Dawson and Reece Topley have also travelled to Mumbai with the England T20 squad. All-rounder Dawson, 26, was included despite head coach Trevor Bayliss admitting he had never seen the all-rounder play competitively, while left-arm paceman Topley was preferred to Chris Woakes. Led by captain Eoin Morgan, England's first match will be against the West Indies on 16 March, with Sri Lanka and South Africa and a group winner from the first-round qualifiers their other Super-10 opponents. "I think having it in the unofficial home of cricket is massively exciting," said Topley, 22. "It's going to be brilliant and it's definitely going to be testing." "Everybody talks about the size of the grounds being a little smaller. They talk about the heat and the dew at night having an effect. It will be a great occasion."	Hampshire captain James Vince says the ICC World Twenty20 can help put him on the path to playing Test cricket.
NHS England guidelines say that 85% of patients should wait a maximum of 62 days to begin their first treatment following referral from their GP. But figures show this slipped to 84.4% from January to March this year. Charities Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support both said it was a worrying sign. The target for treating people diagnosed with cancer within 62 days fell from 85.8% during the previous quarter to 84.4% in the first three months of 2014. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the number of trusts missing this target had doubled over the last year. "This is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain. "The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. "More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. "We're very worried that the coordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS." He said cancer patients were set to increase from two million to three million by 2020. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said some patients were being failed. "The breach of the '62 day target' is very concerning, particularly as four in 10 of those who aren't treated within two months are having to wait three months or more. "These targets exist to encourage swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital to improve survival rates. "Patients want confidence that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS. We hope urgent action will be taken to ensure this breach is a one off." Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met. "It is vital cancer patients are diagnosed and treated quickly so they have the best possible chance of recovery," he said. "Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards. But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped." He said clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were working with local providers in areas where the standard is not being met to ensure patients are treated quickly. Other figures released by NHS England on cancer waiting times showed the number of people seen by a specialist within two weeks of an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer also dropped from 95.6% to 95%. For people urgently referred for breast symptoms, where cancer is not suspected, 93.9% are being seen within two weeks, compared to 95.5% previously. The target is 93%. In total, 60,425 patients with breast symptoms where cancer was not initially suspected were seen in the first three months of this year after being urgently referred.	A key government target for treating people diagnosed with suspected cancer has been breached for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.
The Â£230m development consists of 11 wind turbines. Mr Trump claims they would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course at Menie. He responded: "We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated." Mr Trump said: "We will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself. "This was a purely political decision. "We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed." He had previously threatened not to build a hotel at the resort if it went ahead. Ministers said they were committed to a "successful and sustainable" offshore wind sector. The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project is a joint venture by utility company Vattenfall, engineering firm Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg). The project is aimed at providing enough energy for more than 49,000 homes. The Scottish government said the centre would allow offshore wind developers and supply chain companies to test "cutting edge" wind technology before its commercial deployment. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: "Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets. "The proposed European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will give the industry the ability to test and demonstrate new technologies in order to accelerate its growth. "It secures Aberdeen's place as the energy capital of Europe." He added: "The EOWDC is the first offshore wind farm to pass through the new approvals process for offshore wind development and as such is a test case for the industry. The diligence and expertise of officials in Marine Scotland, among the statutory consultees and other interests should give confidence to the offshore wind industry and its supply chain that planning matters should not be a barrier to investment in Scotland." EOWDC project spokesman Iain Todd said: "The Scottish government's most welcome approval for the EOWDC is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK's offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector. "The project partners will assess the consent and associated conditions as part of the planning and programming for the next phase of the scheme." Alex Salmond, the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: "I welcome this decision. "The north east of Scotland is a world energy capital and in order to continue to prosper we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research - marine renewables, as well as oil and gas." Dr Sam Gardner, senior climate change policy officer at WWF Scotland, said: "Giving the go-ahead to this offshore wind test centre is the right decision, demonstrating that no amount of bluster from US billionaires such as Donald Trump will hold Scotland back from becoming a cleaner, greener, job-creating nation." Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: "The north east is already established as a global hub for the oil and gas industry. "The development of the EOWDC will enable the region to extend its reach with regard to offshore wind, further enhancing our renewable energy expertise and drawing upon our strong engineering and technology skills base. "This is an important development for the region."	Consent for a wind farm off Aberdeen which is opposed by Donald Trump has been granted by the Scottish government, angering the US tycoon.
Amnesty International supporters are zipped into some of the bags in the first few rows, alongside a banner saying #DontLetThemDrown. Bags are lined up in rows in front of the East Sussex resort's Big Wheel close to the pier. The protest comes ahead of an EU leaders' meeting over the crisis. David Cameron will attend the summit in Brussels, which will discuss a response to the growing problem. Amnesty UK director Kate Allen said: "Until now, the UK government's response has been shameful but finally they have been woken up to the need to act. "EU governments must now urgently turn their rhetoric into action to stop more people drowning on their way to Europe."	Two hundred body bags have been placed on Brighton beach in a protest to highlight the UK's response to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.
The seminars will be run by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) in major English cities. New legislation passed this year places a statutory duty on schools and colleges to counter radicalisation. The seminars will be led by Kamal Hanif, head of Birmingham's Waverley School and an expert on Islam and citizenship. The union says the aim is to offer support and guidance to senior school leaders in the wake of high-profile cases such as that of the three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in February and are believed to be in the city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Islamic State. Their families later complained that police, the school and the local authority had failed to pass on information they said could have prevented the girls leaving. The Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015 requires educational establishments to prevent young people being drawn into terrorism. The seminars, in June and July, will help school and college leaders understand these duties and give them practical help and advice. The aim is to maintain an atmosphere of equality and diversity in schools but also to help teachers understand how social media can be used "to groom young people into extremist ideologies", says the union. "This is about having a greater understanding around the issues of radicalisation and extremism," said Mr Hanif. He said the seminars would help head teachers "identify situations" and "deal with them in an appropriate manner, without overreacting and being alarmist. "Young people spend a lot of their time on the web and social media and they can easily get drawn into extremist ideas without access to a counter-narrative. "These seminars will help schools and, in turn, parents, who often have no idea that their children are accessing this sort of information, to pick up the signs, and use the appropriate channels in dealing with these concerns. "They will help to equip heads with the counter-narratives to some of the false claims put out by extremists." Mr Hanif  will be joined by the counter-extremism campaigner Sara Khan, co-founder of the counter-extremism and women's rights organisation Inspire  and by ASCL's parliamentary specialist Anna Cole. Ms Khan said the seminars would clarify what schools were expected to do. "Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of myth propagated about what the statutory requirements mean for both schools and pupils." Ms Cole said the aim was to avoid criminalising young people by helping schools intervene "in the right way at an early stage". "The key thing is to put in place proper risk assessments and have an open culture where different views and ideas can be discussed in an open way. "We want to reassure schools that these steps will help them meet the statutory requirements and protect young people." The seminars in Bristol, Birmingham, Cambridge, London, Manchester, Leeds and Durham will be open to ASCL members and non-members.	Head teachers worried about protecting students from being radicalised are being offered seminars by a union.
Atletico lost Tuesday's quarter-final first leg 2-1, with goalscorer Fernando Torres sent off when they led 1-0. Luis Suarez scored both home goals, but earlier appeared to kick Juanfran. "I don't know what Barca players have to do to get sent off just like us," said Brazil left-back Luis. Holders Barcelona, aiming to become the first team to win back-to-back Champions Leagues, take a slender advantage into the second leg at the Vicente Calderon next Wednesday. Atletico scored a potentially valuable away goal through Torres, but the game turned when the Spain striker was sent off for two needless bookings inside seven minutes. Atletico manager Diego Simeone was incensed by the decision of German referee Felix Brych, who also seemingly missed Suarez lashing out at Atletico right-back Juanfran near the byeline. Media playback is not supported on this device "We shouldn't have got the red card, it was totally unfair," said former Chelsea defender Luis. "It is not easy to play against Barcelona in the Champions League. We know it is really dangerous if they go out in the quarter-finals. We have to play against everyone and everything. "You can tell there is fear that Barca will be eliminated." Luis acknowledged Atletico faced a "really difficult" task to reach the semi-finals but added: "We are still alive. It is possible." Simeone said he was not "angry" with Torres, though the 32-year-old former Chelsea and Liverpool forward later apologised and took responsibility for his dismissal.	Atletico Madrid defender Filipe Luis believes "there is fear that Barcelona will be eliminated" from the Champions League, and claims his side were treated unfairly at the Nou Camp.
Documents filed with US regulator said French authorities recently completed an audit of Booking.com's accounts from 2003 to 2012. The French government said Booking.com had a base in France and was obliged to pay income and value-added taxes. The company said the majority of funds being sought are penalties. "In December 2015, the French tax authorities issued Booking.com assessments for approximately €356m, the majority of which would represent penalties and interest," the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The company said believed it complied with local tax law, and would contest the ruling in court if it could not reach a settlement with the French government. In the same filing Priceline said Italian tax authorities were examining "whether Booking.com should be subject to additional tax obligations in Italy". Last week, Google's headquarters in Paris were searched as part of an investigation into possible tax evasion.	French authorities are seeking €356m (£276m) in unpaid taxes from Booking.com, according to documents filed by parent company Priceline.
Otters were declared extinct on the Japanese islands by its Ministry of the Environment in August 2012. The Skye-based International Otter Survival Fund (IOSF) has been helping with the reintroduction preparations. Dr Takahiro Murakami, who will lead the Japanese visit to Scotland, has never seen otters in the wild. The Japanese otter was believed to be either a subspecies of the Eurasian otter or possibly even a separate species. Conservationists have suggested reintroducing otters to Hokkaido, an island in north Japan. IOSF supports conservation projects across the world. It also rescues and raises orphaned otter cubs.	Conservationists are to visit Skye to learn more about otter habitats ahead of a proposed reintroduction of the mammals to Japan.
District Judge Lucy Koh's move opens the way for US sales of Samsung's older tablet model to restart. Separately, Samsung filed a motion on Tuesday against Apple's iPhone 5 saying its patents had been violated. The iPhone 5 was launched last month and broke Apple's pre-sales record. Apple has not commented on either move. The South Korean firm said it had "little choice little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights". Apple and Samsung, the two market leaders in the lucrative smartphone market, are embroiled in patent disputes in as many as 10 countries. The ban on sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the US was put in place in June ahead of a trial. In August, at the conclusion of that trial, Apple was awarded victory in many of its patent violation claims, centring on accusations that Samsung had copied Apple's iPhone and iPad designs. It was also awarded more than $1bn (Â£664m) in damages. However, the jury found that Samsung had not violated the patent that was the basis for the ban on the sale of the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Samsung, therefore, argued for the sales ban to be lifted.	A temporary sales ban on Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer in the US has been lifted by a US court.
Valerie Cadogan was cycling with her husband when she struck the 25cm (10in) wide, 11cm (4in) pothole and hit her head, Newport Coroner's Court heard. Council workers were called to the area within hours to fill in the potholes in April this year and make the area safe. Coroner David Bowen said the effects of the impact may have been lessened had Mrs Cadogan been wearing a helmet. Mrs Cadogan was airlifted to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital after the incident but never regained consciousness. She died the following day. The Newport Coroner's Court hearing was told Monmouthshire council immediately filled the pothole on St Mary's Road. Mark Watkins, of the local authority's highways department, said the road is inspected annually and they had had no reports of defects there following an inspection in June 2012.	A 72-year-old cyclist died after she fell from her bike after hitting a pothole in Monmouth, an inquest heard.
Rherras is a 23-year-old left-sided player of Moroccan descent who has spent the last year playing for Sint-Truiden in the Belgian top flight. Sammon, the 29-year-old ex-Kilmarnock forward, has agreed a three-year contract as he leaves Derby County. They will arrive as Hearts prepare for their first Europa League qualifier. Six players left Tynecastle in the summer, with three first-team regulars - defender Blaze Augustyn, goalkeeper Neil Alexander and midfielder Miguel Pallardo - all now on the lookout for new clubs.	Hearts are expected to confirm the signing of defender Faycal Rherras and striker Conor Sammon ahead of a return to pre-season training next week.
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday. They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash. The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal. Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper. Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area. He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident. "I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."	Two men have stolen a five-figure sum of money during an armed robbery at a Post Office in Glasgow.
Yet for some chocolate firms the fact that most Easter eggs are hollow is more than just disappointing, it's problematic. "It sounds ridiculous, but there is a lot of air in Easter eggs relative to their value in weight," says Helen Pattinson, co-founder of boutique British chocolate chain Montezuma's. The oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit. Foreign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the £1m mark for the first time. Despite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas. "The economics just haven't added up so far," says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon. The company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer. Despite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate. "The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate," she says. Last year, the UK exported a whopping £245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015. Exports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over £30m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade. It is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International. The family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas. The awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders. "Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries," he says. When the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Now it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was £50m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class. "The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets," he says. Particularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have "something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive" such as a foreign brand. But he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food. Sharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter. "It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (£10-£15; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy. "Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively. "Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition. It is also celebrated by the predominantly Catholic Filipino community who form a large part of the domestic helper workforce," she says. The fervour surrounding the Christian festival has reached such fever pitch that the home and lifestyle gurus at Good Housekeeping magazine recently declared the occasion "a second Christmas". Theresa May criticises Cadbury over Easter egg hunt Co-op's 'Treat your daughter' Easter egg adverts changed It is not just small firms benefiting from the growing sense of occasion. Marks and Spencer says it exports a number of its popular eggs to its 468 shops overseas, with them selling particularly well in Hong Kong, Western Europe and the Czech Republic. "We're seeing double-digit growth on sales of our Easter eggs internationally - with people buying into both our large 'giftable' eggs as well as impulse purchasing small bags of chocolate foiled eggs and bigger bags of eggs for Easter egg hunts - an event which is increasing in popularity," says a spokeswoman. People really like the licensed character eggs and Star Wars' R2D2 is currently the best seller internationally, she adds. While market research firm Mintel doesn't track British chocolate exports, its figures show people around the world are eating more chocolate eggs. "In Brazil, for example, the trade association ABICAB reported that 95 million chocolate Easter eggs were sold in 2016, a 19% increase over 2015. In that country, Easter eggs make up a major percentage of annual chocolate revenues," says global food and drink analyst Marcia Mogelonsky. "In Ireland, consumers spent more than 40m euros (£34m; $42m) on Easter eggs in 2016, while the UK Easter egg market was valued at £220m." It is a market that Montezuma's Mrs Pattinson is obviously keen to exploit. "It's about putting our new product development heads on to find ones that don't have so much air inside," she laughs.	Cracking open a large chocolate egg to find nothing in the middle is one of life's perennial disappointments.
The SNP's John Wallace won the Ayr East ward after the vote on Thursday. Turnout for the by-election was 34.4%, with 4,006 votes cast out of an electorate of 11,638. The by-election was called following the resignation of Corri Wilson, who was elected as SNP MP for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock earlier this year.	The SNP has held a South Ayrshire Council ward following a by-election which was called after the previous incumbent was elected as an MP.
The live broadcast of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer was scheduled for 15 November. The opera set to be performed this autumn portrays the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985. Jewish American passenger Leon Klinghoffer was killed in the attack "I'm convinced that the opera is not anti-Semitic," the Met's General Manager, Peter Gelb, wrote in a statement. "But I've also become convinced that there is genuine concern in the international Jewish community that the live transmission of The Death of Klinghoffer would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe." The decision was taken after discussions between Mr Gelb and the Anti-Defamation League, which represented Klinghoffer's children. Mr Adams criticised the decision, telling Associated Press news agency the opera "in no form condones or promotes violence, terrorism or anti-Semitism". The Achille Lauro had been sailing the Mediterranean on 7 October 1985 when the gang - members of a splinter group of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organisation - attacked. During a two-day standoff, the group demanded the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners and killed Klinghoffer, 69, before throwing him overboard. The Palestinian militants initially escaped after allowing the Achille Lauro to dock in Egypt. Later, the US military intercepted an Egyptian plane which the hijackers were using to flee and forced it to land in Sicily, where the four hijackers were arrested. Youssef Magied al-Molqui, the leader of the group which overtook the Achille Lauro, was released from an Italian prison in 2009 after serving nearly 24 years.	New York's Metropolitan Opera has cancelled plans for a global HD broadcast of a performance amid fears it could spark anti-Semitic sentiment.
The newly crowned Women's Super League champions took the lead when Fran Kirby skipped past her marker and hit a sweet strike from the edge of the area. The visitors' best chance fell to Kelly Montgomery just after the break, but she volleyed over the bar. Glasgow keeper Lee Alexander also saved well from Millie Bright and Ana Borges. England striker Kirby had netted twice in the 4-0 win over Sunderland that sealed Chelsea's first league title on Sunday, and proved to be their matchwinner again with her 39th-minute effort. Glasgow, who reached the quarter-finals of the competition last season, struggled to create chances but were left to rue Montgomery's miss. The lively Kirby shot wide after escaping from a crowd of defenders as Chelsea pushed for a second, and after denying Bright and substitute Borges, Alexander did well late on to hold another rising strike from Kirby, giving the Scottish league champions hope for next Wednesday's second leg in Glasgow. Chelsea Ladies boss Emma Hayes told BBC Sport: "To win 1-0 at home with a clean sheet, for the first time (in Europe) in Chelsea's history, we have to savour these moments. "Overall it was a good performance. "If it wasn't for their goalkeeper, we'd be talking about at least a two-goal lead tonight." Glasgow City boss Scott Booth told BBC Sport: "I thought we were excellent. We came here to do a certain job and I couldn't have asked any more of my players. "We came up against some of the best players in the world. We more than matched them at times. "We were undone by a moment of brilliance from Kirby. I'm looking forward to the away leg, because we're still in this."

A statement called on Haitians to remain calm until a solution is found. Mr Privert was appointed in February for a six-month term. He filled the vacancy left by former President Michel Martelly, who stepped down with no successor after the suspension of elections last year. Haiti has been mired in political crisis since the disputed first round on 25 October. Representatives of Haiti's main donors, which include the UN and the Organisation of American States (OAS), have called for fresh elections without delay. Has the international community failed Haiti? "This... marks the end of the 120-day mandate of the republic's provisional president," read a statement from the Senate deputy president and the president of the Chamber of Deputies. The statement urged people to "remain calm until the National Assembly meets to take the necessary measures". Last month, a special commission recommended throwing out the disputed results of last year's first-round presidential election and holding a new vote. The commission said various irregularities meant last October's ballot could not be considered legitimate. Haiti has been in political turmoil since the first round, in which Jovenel Moise came first but fell short of an overall majority. Opposition challenger Jude Celestin accused the electoral authorities of favouring Mr Moise and threatened to pull out of the run-off. Deadlines have since been missed for four run-off votes, on some occasions leading to violent unrest.	Haiti faces a power vacuum after parliament allowed the mandate of interim President Jocelerme Privert to lapse with still no solution to the country's political crisis.
Six incidents have been reported to police between 3 and 13 February. In all the cases, two or three men have targeted foreign national tourists in an attempt to steal money - succeeding on two occasions. The men, who are described as southern European, claimed to be police officers before demanding to search the victims. Police Scotland said the first incident took place at about 13:20 on 3 February in the Grassmarket, when a Chilean man was approached by a man who asked him to take his photograph. The pair were then approached by two suspects who claimed to be police officers and then demanded to search them. The two police impersonators then got into a silver or grey Seat hatchback and drove away and the other man walked into the Grassmarket. Officers said the Chilean man later realised a three-figure sum of money had been stolen from him. On 13 February, two Chinese tourists lost a four-figure sum of cash when they were targeted in a similar scam on Market Street. They were approached by two men who showed them ID and said they were undercover police officers. Other incidents happened in Chambers Street, Castle Street, and in the Calton Hill area. There was one incident on 3 February, one on 11 February and four on 13 February. Sgt Mark Hamilton, of Police Scotland, said: "These men are purposely targeting tourists who are visiting the city centre in a bid to steal money from them. "Impersonating a police officer is not only inappropriate, it is illegal. We would advise that if you are stopped by someone claiming to be a Police Scotland officer, request their collar number and ask to see a warrant card. "All our officers are happy to provide this information to the public and it should be offered readily."	Police in Edinburgh are investigating a series of thefts and attempted thefts where men have impersonated police officers.
One of the men was arrested in the capital Berlin and the other in a town close to Cologne, in west Germany. Police seized computers, mobile phones and sketches in the raids but did not find a "smoking gun", prosecutors' spokesman Martin Steltner said. About 450 officers were involved in the raids. One of the men detained, reported to be aged 35, had been living in a refugee shelter in the town of Attendorn, east of Cologne, and is wanted by the Algerian authorities for alleged links to IS. Police said "investigations show that he has been trained militarily in Syria". The man's wife, also wanted by Algeria, was detained at the same time but prosecutors said she was not a suspect in the German case. The suspect held in Berlin was arrested on suspicion of falsifying identity documents, police said. Two other Algerians in Germany, said by police to be "from the jihadist scene", were tracked down but not arrested. "Our understanding is that the four men accused could have planned to carry out an attack together," Mr Steltner said. German media said the possible targets included central Berlin tourist sites Checkpoint Charlie and Alexanderplatz. Since January, the suspects had changed their mobile phones multiple times and communicated using instant messaging services, reports said. Germany's security concerns have risen since the Paris attacks last year. Officials declined to comment on a report in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, citing security sources, which said senior IS figures had ordered an attack on Germany.	German police have arrested two Algerians suspected of planning an attack and having links to the militant group, Islamic State (IS).
The girl band was due to play a matinee and evening show at the SSE Arena on Thursday. The cancellation was announced just minutes after the doors opened for the afternoon performance. Fans were later informed by text message that the show would not be going ahead as scheduled. Michael Green was in Belfast for the concert with his daughters, aged five and six. He said the family had been among fans who were disappointed when One Direction re-scheduled their Belfast concert last October. Mr Green told the BBC he felt "physically gutted and a little bit sick" when he was told the kids were to be let down again. "I thought this couldn't happen again, what are the chances?" Michael had surprised his daughters with the tickets on Christmas morning and travelled from Coleraine to see the girl band. He said he was worried the band would re-schedule for an afternoon when the children were back at school. "I'm really, really annoyed. Once again they've waited until we got here to tell us it was cancelled." Mother Geraldine McLaughlin had brought her stepdaughter, Stacey, to the concert for her birthday. She said the 16-year-old's birthday had been ruined by the news. "We came down to Belfast and booked into the Ramada to make a day of it," she said. "Stacey was so excited about this, I don't know what we'll do for the rest of the day. "We're just going to go back to the hotel now to get away from this chaos." Thousands of young people were gathered at the SSE Arena at lunchtime on Thursday when the announcement was made via speakerphone. Ms McLaughlin said many of them were in tears. "It's not been handled very well," she said. "There's absolute bedlam down here now. "Surely they could have informed us before we all landed at the place? This was minutes before the show was due to begin." A statement from gig promoter Aikens said: "We regret to announce that both Little Mix shows at the SSE Arena will not take place today due to Jesy being unwell and not able to perform. "Please hold on to your tickets - we hope to be able to make a further announcement on possible rescheduling later today." Ms McLaughlin pointed out that if the concert is rescheduled for next week, children will be back at school. "You can't just take a day off school and time off work for a concert," she said. Mother Sarah-Louise Murray had tickets for her and her three-year-old daughter, Scarlett, to see the band on Thursday afternoon. She said Scarlett had been in tears when she was told the concert was not going ahead. "We had special matching T-shirts made for the day and she was so looking forward to it. "We arrived after 13:00 when the doors were due to open because I wanted to avoid the crowds, but when we got to the arena the queues of people were still waiting outside. "When we heard from others that it was cancelled I put Scarlett back in the pram and told her we had to go home and come back another day." It is the second major cancellation to disappoint young music fans in the city in recent times. Last October, One Direction called off a gig at the SSE at late notice after singer Liam Payne became ill.	The band Little Mix have been forced to cancel their Belfast gigs after singer Jesy Nelson became unwell.
Alexander Ankvab reportedly retreated to his home town Gudauta, 40km (25 miles) away, when talks with the opposition broke down. Many people in the Russian-backed region are unhappy with the ailing economy and lack of reforms. But Abkhazian nationalist feeling is also fuelling the unrest. By Michael CecireForeign Policy Research Institute The 2014 Sochi Olympics were billed as a way of boosting the economy by bringing tourism to Abkhazia or sourcing materials for construction, but the most noticeable effect was actually a source of frustration: the expanded security cordon that penetrated beyond the Russia-Abkhazia border. Some economic problems can certainly be attributed to the de facto government, but it is Russia that has the real power to improve conditions. For example, the Moscow-financed building boom in Chechnya has improved material conditions (even if human rights remain a deep problem), but nothing comparable has happened in Abkhazia. However, the opposition's chief point of contention is Alexander Ankvab's more liberal (relatively speaking) policy towards ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia. He has advocated more fully integrating them, granting them Abkhazian "citizenship". The opposition has painted this as a purely political ploy to expand his electoral base and say it could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity. Analysis: Unrest in Abkhazia The protesters are led by Raul Khadzhimba, a former prime minister and vice-president of Abkhazia, who was defeated by Mr Ankvab in elections in August 2011. The Black Sea coastal region is recognised as a state only by Russia and a few other countries. It broke away from Georgia after a civil war more than 20 years ago and declared formal independence in 2008. Since then, it has relied militarily and financially on Russia. Russia is reportedly sending two senior officials, presidential aide Vladislav Surkov and deputy security council secretary Rashid Nurgaliyev, to Sukhumi in response to the crisis. Opinion among the opposition is said to be divided between those who want Abkhazia to rely less on Russia and those who instead want it to become part of Russia. Mr Ankvab accused the opposition of attempting a coup on Tuesday and said the security forces remained "loyal to the state" and were "taking measures to stabilise the situation". Raul Khadzhimba defended the protests, saying: "Over all the years of his rule the president did not allow anybody in his circle to do their work. "He took upon himself everybody's responsibilities on their behalf, whether he should or should not have been doing this. That led to our country in fact becoming an authoritarian regime. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: "The Russian side is following events closely and with concern... and considers it important that socio-political processes develop exclusively along legal lines."	The president of the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia is said to have fled the capital Sukhumi after opposition protesters seized his office.
The process involves growing someone's cells in an incubator and then mixing them with a liquid which is 3D printed into the jelly-like shape needed. It is then put back in an incubator to grow again until it is ready. Researchers in Swansea hope to be among the first in the world to start using it on humans within three years. "In simple terms, we're trying to grow new tissue using human cells," said Prof Iain Whitaker, consultant plastic surgeon at the Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Morriston Hospital. "We're trialling using 3D printing which is a very exciting potential modality to make these relatively complex structures. "Most people have heard a lot about 3D printing and that started with traditional 3D printing using plastics and metals. "That has now developed so we can consider printing biological tissue called 3D bio-printing, which is very different. "We're trying to print biological structures using human cells, and provide the right environment and the right timing so it can grow into tissue that we can eventually put into a human. "It would be to reconstruct lost body parts such as part of the nose or the ear and ultimately large body parts including bone, muscle and vessels." The team of surgeons are working with scientists and engineers who have built a 3D printer specifically for this work. Prof Whitaker, who is also the chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Swansea University's medical school, said the project started in 2012 but research in the field has been going on for more than 20 years. He said the work would have to be tested on animals and go through an ethics process before being used on humans. "The good news in the future is, if our research is successful, within two months you'd be able to recreate a body part which was not there without having to resort to taking it from another part of the body which would cause another defect or scar elsewhere," he added.	Patients needing surgery to reconstruct body parts such as noses and ears could soon have treatment using cartilage which has been grown in a lab.
"I was very nervous and my words just came out wrong," he wrote on Facebook. The Night Manager star drew censure on social media for a speech in which he referred to aid workers in South Sudan "binge-watching" the programme. The British actor said that his "only intention" had been "to salute [their] incredible bravery and courage." "I apologise that my nerves got the better of me," his post continued. Hiddleston won his first Golden Globe on Sunday - for best performance by an actor in a mini-series or TV movie - for his role in the BBC's adaptation of John le Carre's novel about a hotel manager involved in arms smuggling. After thanking his co-stars and the show's director, he told "a quick story" about a recent visit to "the youngest country in the world". "One night... a group of doctors and nurses wanted to say hello... because they had binge-watched The Night Manager," he continued. "The idea that we could provide some relief and entertainment for the people who... are fixing the world in the places it is broken made me immensely proud." West Wing star Joshua Malina was among those to take issue with the speech, which drew a mixed response from the Golden Globes audience. "Thank you to Tom Hiddleston and all actors who dare to perform in projects that are shown in some of the most dangerous parts of the world," he tweeted. "That was a long story Tom Hiddleston told to pay himself a compliment," wrote the writer and producer Gary Janetti. Other commentators drew attention to the neutral expressions of actors Naomie Harris and Christian Slater during Hiddleston's address. Yet his words drew a warmer response from the World Food Programme, who said it felt "honoured" to have been given a mention. Hiddleston's award was one of three Golden Globes won by The Night Manager, which also picked up supporting actor prizes for Olivia Colman and Hugh Laurie. Colman, who was not at the Los Angeles ceremony, said she was "gutted" she had not been present to accept "such an enormous honour".

London turned down the chance to host the Grand Depart, citing the cost of staging the event - reported to be about £35m - as the reason. It will be the first time since West Berlin in 1987 that Germany has hosted the opening stage of road cycling's premier race. La Manche in north-west France will host the 2016 Grand Depart. This 2015 event started in the Dutch city of Utrecht, a year after thousands came to Leeds to watch the cyclists set off.	The 2017 Tour de France will begin in the German city of Dusseldorf, it has been announced.
After years of decline, the number of public authority homes sold in the year to March rose from 1,209 to 1,526. Ministers announced last year that right-to-buy, previously abolished for new tenants, was to end altogether. Statisticians concluded that the announcement was "likely to be responsible" for the upturn in sales. Over the same period, 1,140 new council homes were built in Scotland, the highest total in 25 years. The number of affordable homes also rose by 17%, with 7,012 completed. Housing minister Margaret Burgess said: "Over 4,000 new council houses have been delivered through the Scottish government's council house building programme since 2009. "The supply of affordable housing continues to be a high priority for us and we are working with the entire sector to increase the supply of affordable homes and deliver vital support for construction and housebuilding companies throughout Scotland. "Since 2011 we have delivered more than 21,000 new affordable homes, bringing us over two-thirds of the way towards our five-year target of 30,000 new homes." Across Scotland the total number of new homes increased by 7% over the past year to 15,957 - with Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow accounting for more than a quarter. The increase is the first since 2007/08 but the supply of new homes still remains well below pre-recession levels. Ms Burgess said: "This is the first annual increase since before the recession, reflecting the growing confidence within the housing market, which the Scottish government has helped to stimulate through investment in initiatives designed to support the sector and help people into home ownership. "Nonetheless, new housing supply remains well below pre-recession levels and I recognise that the housebuilding industry continues to face a number of challenges." The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) broadly welcomed the new statistics. It said: "The recognition, however, that we still have a very long way to go to recover from the 42% decrease in completions since then, is sobering and reflects the challenge to all providers of new housing. "The drop in housing association completions represents the time lag between the introduction of the new subsidy levels in 2013 and the time taken to kick-start many projects previously unviable because of lower grant levels. "However, the increase in approvals for housing association projects - up from 1,620 in 2012/13 to 2,875 in 2013/14 - gives some hope that we are beginning to recover from a devastating slowdown in the construction of social housing, at a time when almost one million Scots can't afford adequate housing conditions." Responding to the figures, trade body Homes for Scotland warned that sustained increases in production were now under threat after last month's announcement that the Scottish government's Help to Buy scheme had run out of money for this financial year. Chief executive Philip Hogg said: "The figures show that the increase in supply was driven by the private sector and this clearly demonstrates the huge impact made by the very successful Help to Buy (Scotland) scheme, which has generated over 4,300 sales and reservations since launch less than a year ago. "Whilst we applaud the Scottish government for introducing the scheme, funding for this year has already run out, leaving both buyers and builders very frustrated. "The industry has effectively had the rug pulled from beneath it before any firm recovery has had the opportunity to take hold. "And the impact is already apparent with significant drops in sales in the weeks since the budget expired in July.  We therefore fear a return to decline in the months ahead.	Council house sales in Scotland rose by 26% following the decision to scrap tenants' right-to-buy, according to official figures.
The Republican Party is too badly divided. His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be "idiots", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population "swing" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. Butâ€¦ butâ€¦ butâ€¦ cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. "The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy," he writes. "Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations." Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. "We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win," Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. "Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it." The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988. "These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else," writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein. If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the "missing white voters". Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million. These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate. It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries. In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still. That's a lot of "if's", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California. There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman. Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017. For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.	In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn.
Officials earlier identified the remains as belonging to a female passenger called Hayati Lutfiah Hamid. Ms Hamid, 49, was buried at a ceremony attended by family and friends in the Indonesian city of Surabaya. The discovery of two bodies on Thursday brings the number recovered to nine. Bad weather has continued to hamper the search for the plane and other victims. The Airbus A320-200 came down four days ago en route from Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. No survivors have been found and the cause of the crash remains unknown. The identity of Ms Hamid was confirmed using fingerprints "and other means," East Java disaster official Col Budiyono said. Her body was handed over to family members in a brief ceremony at a police hospital in Surabaya. The coffin was then transported to a village, before being buried according to Islamic burial customs. One of Ms Hamid's relatives told AP news agency: "We have been fraught with worry because at this point, three of our family members are still missing... we pray together every night that they will be found soon." Previous media reports had incorrectly identified Ms Hamid as a flight attendant. The nine recovered bodies were flown to an airbase in Borneo but some have since been sent onto Surabaya where relatives, providing DNA samples, are waiting for them to be identified. For a second day in a row, search efforts have been hampered by heavy rain and rough seas. Some 50 divers from Indonesia were on standby to investigate a large shadow in the sea, thought to be part of the airliner, but they were unable to gain access due to the bad weather. AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes said on Thursday he believed the search was closing in on its final location, tweeting: "I am hoping that the latest information is correct and aircraft has been found." Ships and planes have been scouring the Java Sea off Borneo since the plane disappeared on Sunday. Malaysia, Australia and Thailand are helping Indonesia with the search, while the US destroyer USS Sampson has been sent to the zone. They are hoping to locate the fuselage of the plane on the seabed and find the plane's "black box" recorders, which could provide clues about the cause of the crash. "It's possible the bodies are in the fuselage," said search and rescue co-ordinator Sunarbowo Sand. "It's a race now against time and weather." Flight QZ8501, from Surabaya in Java to Singapore, disappeared on Sunday. Debris from the plane was located in the sea on Tuesday. There were 137 adult passengers, 17 children and one infant, along with two pilots and five crew, on the plane. The majority of those on board were Indonesians. Some investigators are reported to believe that the plane may have gone into an aerodynamic stall as the pilot climbed steeply to avoid a storm. Officials quoted by the Reuters news agency say that the plane was travelling at 32,000ft (9,750m) when it requested to climb to 38,000ft to avoid bad weather. When air traffic controllers consented to allow it to climb to 34,000ft a few minutes later, they got no reply. A source quoted by Reuters said that radar data appeared to show that the aircraft's "unbelievably" steep climb may have been beyond the Airbus A320's limits. However, the unnamed source emphasised that more information was needed before a definitive conclusion could be reached. AirAsia previously had an excellent safety record and there were no fatal accidents involving its aircraft.	The first victim of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, found in the Java Sea after the crash on Sunday, has been laid to rest.
"[The Renewable Heat Incentive scandal] may have been the excuse but it certainly wasn't the cause of the election. "The cause of the election was Sinn Féin and republicanism wanting to rerun the election, they have mobilised their vote in a very effective way." "We fought a positive campaign and the public responded well. We will be at Stormont on Monday and have a job of work to deal with. "I have said when Sinn Féin win, we win for all." "I am the one who suggested that in a normal society people would vote on performance and that the DUP and Sinn Féin did not earn another mandate. "They certainly did not give me a mandate big enough to feel justified in continuing in this position, so I shall not." "This is a victory for those who chose devolution over direct rule, for those who want power sharing to work. "It is now incumbent on all parties to ensure that power is retained in our Assembly, not handed back to Theresa May and James Brokenshire." "It has been a good day for Alliance. Our vote is up and in constituencies where we have been weak, we have seen the effort we put in trying to build the vote, pay off in terms of vote share. It's very positive and I hope that translates into something positive for trying to get devolution established." "What will now concern people is the very existence of this place as a political entity. People have rejected the middle ground, the non sectarian power-sharing approach. These two parties (DUP and Sinn Féin) are not going to share power." "Everyone now has a shared responsibility to engage intensively in the short period of time that is available to us, to ensure that a strong and stable administration is established. "It is with this positive intent that the UK government approaches the days ahead." "Mike Nesbitt did the right thing by resigning because if he hadn't, there would have been an unpleasant discussion (within his party). The talks now will be between the DUP and Sinn Féin and the SDLP and UUP are brought in as a decoration." "We now have a situation where the two parties are neck-and-neck and that is a reality we have to deal with, and we have to listen to the concerns of people expressed during the election. "Like all parties there are lessons that we need to learn." "The high turnout demonstrates the continued support of the people of Northern Ireland for the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and devolved power-sharing government. "Now the politicians they elected must come together to establish an executive which can operate effectively and deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect."	Senior figures from across Northern Ireland's political spectrum have been reacting to the results of the March 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly elections.
Spurs, who are having a new £400m stadium built next to their existing home White Hart Lane, could also play next season's home Champions League games at the national stadium. They aim to move into their new 61,000-seat home before the 2018-19 season. "We're a long way down the path on reaching an agreement," Dyke said. "I think there's some discussion about whether they'll play their Champions League games there at Wembley next year but I don't know much about that." Tottenham's north-London rivals Arsenal hosted Champions League games at Wembley in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Dyke also said Chelsea could play home games at Wembley in the near future. The Blues have plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge, which could leave them needing a temporary home for several seasons. "I think Chelsea might come for a longer period," he told Sky Sports News HQ. "Chelsea have got really exciting plans for their stadium. They're going to demolish the whole thing and build a whole new stadium on the existing site. "If they came to Wembley, that would mean them coming for three years."	Tottenham are close to a deal to play home games at Wembley in the 2017-18 season, says Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.
Experts are cautious because the drug, aducanumab, is still in the early stages of development. But a study in Nature has shown it is safe and hinted that it halts memory decline. Larger studies are now under way to fully evaluate the drug's effects. The build-up of amyloid in the brain has been a treatment target for many years. This study, of 165 patients, was designed to test aducanumab was safe to take. After a year of treatment, it also showed the higher the dose the stronger the effect on amyloid plaques. The researchers then carried out tests on memory and found "positive effects". However, 40 people dropped out of the study, half because of side effects they experienced, such as headaches. These too were much more common with a higher dosage. The next phase of research - phase 3 - involves two separate studies. These are recruiting 2,700 patients with very early stage Alzheimer's across North America, Europe and Asia in order to fully test the drug's effect on cognitive decline. Dr Alfred Sandrock of the biotech company Biogen, which worked with the University of Zurich on the research, said:  "Phase 3 really needs to be done and I hope it will confirm what we have seen in this study. "One day I could envisage treating people who have no symptoms because if you have amyloid in the brain it's likely you'll develop Alzheimer's one day." However, there have been many disappointments in Alzheimer's drug development, and it is over a decade since the last drug for people with the condition was licensed. Other experts have welcomed this latest research - but with caution. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the results provided "tantalising evidence that a new class of drug to treat the disease may be on the horizon". And Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, added: "What is most compelling is that more amyloid was cleared when people took higher doses of the drug. "No existing treatments for Alzheimer's directly interfere with the disease process and so a drug that actually slows the progress of the disease by clearing amyloid would be a significant step." However, Dr Tara Spires-Jones, of the Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems at the University of Edinburgh, said: "I am cautiously optimistic about this treatment, but trying not to get too excited because many drugs make it through this early stage of testing then go on to fail in larger trials." And John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, said: "These new data are tantalising but they are not yet definitive."	A drug that destroys the characteristic protein plaques that build up in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's is showing "tantalising" promise, scientists say.
The £570m project to extend the Chilwell and Clifton lines began in March 2012. The first public trams started running at 06:00 BST. Despite facing criticism for causing disruption to businesses and commuters, Nottingham City Council insists the service will transform the local economy. Delays were initially blamed on unexpected numbers of pipes and cables having to be moved, and then on work to replace part of the track bed. £570m Initial budget 28 new stations 11 miles of new track 22 new trams 20  million passenger capacity Contractor Vinci has reported the problems contributed to a £165m loss for its civil engineering division. Jane Urquhart, who has lead responsibility for operation company NET at Nottingham City Council, said it was a "really great day" for the city. "With trams running from every seven minutes, it is all set to provide easier access to key locations right across the city," she said. "The tram provides the backbone to the city's integrated transport network, underpinning all the efforts to reduce congestion, improve the environment and make Nottingham an even better place to live, work or visit." NET and the city council had resisted calls to name a date for the new lines opening but final testing had been ongoing in recent weeks. Steve Barber, vice president of the Light Rail Transit Association and former Broxtowe borough councillor said: "We are very relieved, as, I think, are a lot of people in Beeston. "It has been a quite difficult ride over the past few years while construction has been at its worst ... and it is going to do wonders for the town and the city." Stephen Knight, a butcher in Clifton, said: "We are optimistic. It has caused disruption, normal trade dropped by a third but the workers have helped. "Now we will see if the public come back - but there are still a lot of parking restrictions outside." Lisa Withers, a nearby florist, said: "I was really pleased to have been on the first tram from Clifton - and seeing the one from Toton arrive has been fantastic. "It is a really great day for the city and I think we will now see some real regeneration and the tram driving Nottingham forward for people who live here and who work here and people who want to visit."	Full services on Nottingham's new tram lines have started, eight months behind schedule.
The group claim they are owed $40,000 (Â£23,500) by the Illinois-based outfit WorldWide Fan Clubs. The company had been charged with managing subscriptions and fan records for Duran Duran, with 75% of profits going to the musicians. Its owners declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press. According to their legal action, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Duran Duran also contend that the company - which operates out of the town of Glenview - failed to keep accurate accounts of fan club activity since they gained the contract for the work in 2010. It also stated they have made repeated requests for the unpaid fees to be settled. Part of their brief was to process subscriptions from fans, while their headquarters would also serve as a warehouse for the distribution of band merchandise. They were entitled to keep 25% of proceeds for their activities. Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978, with its core members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor still in the line-up today. They have enjoyed a string of hits in both the UK and US, including Hungry Like The Wolf and Rio. In 2012, they performed at a concert to mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in Hyde Park. The band are currently at work on their 14th studio album.	Pop band Duran Duran have taken legal action against the US company charged with running their fan club over unpaid revenues, court papers have revealed.
But once the votes are counted, what can residents expect to pay in council tax? Below are the figures for a Band D property for every council area in Wales for the current financial year of 2017/18, how much that has gone up by for the current year, and what the average property in the area actually pays. They are grouped here by police force region - council tax includes the police precept which is added to the overall bill paid by homes. Local government is not fully funded by council tax. Much of the funding for councils comes in the form of grants from the Welsh Government, which in turn gets its funding from the UK government in London. In 2017/18 a total of £4.1bn is being divided among Wales' 22 councils. The lions share of council cash goes on schools - with social services following behind, as shown in the graph above. Residents pay council tax based on which band their property is in, based on its worth. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities. It is used to charge tax to a property that, in Wales, was worth between £91,001 to £123,000 on April 2003 values. Council tax gets lower the cheaper a property is, and higher the more expensive a property is. Council tax figures source: Welsh Government	Voters will go to the polls on Thursday to determine who will represent them on local councils.
Officials in the city of Novosibirsk ruled that Parnas, the main opposition coalition, had failed to collect enough valid signatures to take part. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny called the move a "blow to the democratic freedom of Russians". The regional ballot is seen by Russia's opposition as a key test in the run-up to next year's parliamentary vote. The three hunger strikers were detained by police and fined for staging a protest. They and other activists in the Siberian city had spent weeks collecting the thousands of signatures required to register for election. But the election commission in Novosibirsk - Russia's third largest city - found faults with more than 1,000 of the 11,000 signatures they submitted. The activists insist they were valid, and said the authorities used out-of-date databases to check them. In one case, a woman's signature was ruled out because her middle name came up in records as Timurovich, a man's name, instead of Timurovna. The three - Leonid Volkov, Sergey Boyko and Yegor Savin - have said they will eat nothing and drink only water until their case is reviewed. Mr Navalny warned that the "surreal" action could be replicated in other elections, both regional and national. He is a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, accusing the government of large-scale corruption. "There is a political order not to let the opposition take part in elections," he told Moscow Echo radio station.	Three Russian opposition activists have gone on hunger strike after they were barred from running in local elections.

Muir will be joined in her races by Eilish McColgan, while Olympians Eilidh Doyle and Steph Twell will also feature on the track in Serbia. Also competing will be 800m runner Guy Learmonth and high jumper Allan Smith. Last weekend, Muir shaved a second off Dame Kelly Holmes' British indoor 1,000m mark, also setting a new European record with the second fastest run of all time. That followed her European 3,000m indoor record and the British 5,000m indoor record, after beating Holmes' British outdoor 1500m mark last summer. British Athletics performance director Neil Black is pleased with the "blend" of the team. Scots named in British Athletics team: Men: 800m: Guy Learmonth High Jump: Allan Smith Women: 400m: Eilidh Doyle 1500m: Laura Muir, Eilish McColgan 3000m: Laura Muir, Eilish McColgan, Steph Twell 4x400m: Eilidh Doyle	Laura Muir will bid to become double European Champion next month in the 1500m and 3000m at the European Athletics Indoor Championships.
The capital has had a representative in Super League since its inception in 1996 but London's side has never won the league title or the Challenge Cup. "London is a unique opportunity," Nigel Wood told BBC London 94.9. "It is almost inconceivable to consider yourself a national sport without having a strong presence in the capital. We just have to make sure that we get that presence right. "It is probably not right as it is and we need to work with all the stakeholders to improve that. "It is extremely important that we 'do London' and 'do London' well in terms of rugby league." Three separate attempts to introduce a professional rugby league club in London had been made in the 1930s with London Highfield, Acton & Willesden and Streatham & Mitcham. The sport returned to the capital in 1980 when Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay announced the formation of Fulham Rugby League Club. London's team has had four name changes since then: Games have been staged at various venues around London, with Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and Twickenham Stoop among longer-term homes. Semi-professional side London Skolars were formed in 1995 while Hemel Stags join the ranks in third tier Championship One this season. London Broncos are England's sole Super League side south of Widnes while Hemel Stags, on the outskirts of London, have recently joined London Skolars among the semi-professional ranks. The numbers of people playing the game in London and the south have grown since the advent of Super League, but Sport England cut rugby league's funding by £10.1 million in December. Wood is keen that the sport continues to progress in the south of the country. "First and foremost, there needs to be a very easily understood plan," Wood added. "I think it is important we pull all the strands together to come up with a credible plan that the whole of the rugby league community in London can get behind and buy into. "Once we find that then I think the game has a chance to go from strength to strength. "It's not any one person's problem. It's our problem. "We will try and work with all of the key decision-makers within London rugby league and its environs to come up with a strategy that works." Rugby league was played professional in London in the 1930s, but the sport returned to the capital in 1980 when Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay announced the formation of Fulham Rugby League Club. Since then, London's rugby league club has gone through four separate guises and played at a number of different sports venues in and around the capital. The franchise have finished in the bottom four in the table in each season since 2007 and the Broncos only secured their first victory of 2013 against Salford Reds last Friday, in what was their fifth game of the campaign. Broncos head coach Tony Rea said last year that, in time, the club could become the biggest in Super League and Wood says the RFL are committed to continuing to help the Broncos in their development. "Clearly they have got their challenges as a club at the moment and I know that [owner] David Hughes, [chief executive] Gus Mackay and Tony will be working as hard as they can," he said. "We have worked closely with the club in the past and we need to continue to do that. "There is a lot of rugby league played around London and we need a Super League club to sit on the top of that. It is almost inconceivable to consider yourself a national sport without having a strong presence in the capital. It is extremely important that we 'do London' and 'do London' well in terms of rugby league "But that is not a licence to occupy a place in Super League indefinitely. "There are standards that have to be maintained. "On-field success is one of those, as are other issues such as making sure there is a decent attendance so that everybody who engages with the club has a positive impression. "It is important to us and important to David and we are going to do the very best we can. "It is important that the Broncos could be credible, competitive and be contenders. "Most people would settle for that and an understanding they are making progress off the field with attendances and revenues that go with it. "The development side and the production of young talent has made remarkable strides over the last decade. "People judge the progress the club will make with what happens on the field with the first team. That's where we need to see some improvement if we can. "We'll help David as much as we can." The club, who were renamed London Broncos last year, have played at the Twickenham Stoop since 2006 following their affiliation with rugby union side Harlequins. Their average league attendances have dropped in the last four seasons and the Broncos face a dilemma over where their long-term future lies. In the years since their formation in Fulham in 1980, London's side have staged their home games at a plethora of venues across the city, including Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and the Twickenham Stoop, as well as staging one-off games further afield. The Broncos are looking to move ground ahead of next season, having decided against renewing their ground-share with rugby union side Harlequins. Wood says it is up to the owners to decide where to base the club. "The Broncos had have a concern over where they should be located in the capital," Wood said. "We need to make sense of that and within the club they need to work out where their location is best served. "There are pockets of activity in east London, some in the north and some out in Feltham where they train. "The club is privately-owned and ultimately they are responsible for the destiny and direction of the club. "The League will seek to assist and support and, where possible, provide counsel and advice. "But at the end of the day we have to stop short of being the people that make the decisions as we are just a governing body." While the Broncos have fostered dual-registration ties with London Skolars and Hemel Stags, Wood says it is also the RFL's responsibility to aid and encourage new clubs further down the leagues. Along with the Stags, Oxford and University of Gloucestershire All Golds are additions to the third tier Championship One this season and all three played their first competitive games at the weekend. "Fundamentally as a governing body, we have got an obligation to invigilate the rules and adjudicate between the clubs on an impartial basis," Wood said. 2009: 3,436 (13 games) 2010: 3,374 (13 games) 2011: 3,131 (13 games) 2012: 2,703 (11 games) "That is our first and foremost requirement. "Rugby league has always, because of its dependency on certain geographical areas, stepped out of that straitjacket. "We have said what more can we do to support the clubs that don't have the benefit of 100 years' worth of flourishing community game and or close neighbours who they can trade players with. "We have tried over the last decade to work with clubs - as we have in London and Wales and as we will do so with Hemel, Oxford and Gloucester - to understand that they have slightly different challenges. "It also presents fantastic opportunities. When you have a professional club in a new area they are frankly the only employment opportunity for certain players. "We try and work with those clubs without over-stepping our mark of impartiality."	The chief executive of the Rugby Football League says the governing body needs to improve its strategy in London.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old London 2012 gold medallist recorded 8.18m in his final jump to win ahead of Uruguay's Emiliano Lasa (7.96m). Holly Bradshaw set a new British women's pole vault record of 4.80m. There was a minute's silence before the event for the victims of Monday's attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and another 116 were injured by a suicide bomber as the crowd left a performance by US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The Great City Games, which is staged in the city centre, was given the go-ahead by council and police on Tuesday. The Great Manchester Run will also go ahead this Sunday and will be covered on BBC One from 12:30-14:30 BST. Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. "It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us," said Rutherford afterwards. "It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. "Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to. I love it for the football and I love it for all you guys getting behind us in sport. "It truly is a special place." Media playback is not supported on this device It was a superb evening for Bradshaw, who beat her own personal best before going on to surpass her own British record in the pole vault. Starting at 4.50m, the 25-year-old from Preston cleared at the third attempt to ensure victory over her rivals, with fellow Britons Rachel Gibbons and Sally Peake and Belgium's Chloe Henry all failing to go higher than 4m. She then went on to surpass the mark of 4.71m she set in 2012 before also clearing 4.80m at the first attempt. "It was a bit nerve-wracking at the start," Bradshaw, who was sixth at London 2012 and fifth four years later in Rio, told BBC Sport. "But there were great conditions. Once I got in the zone, to jump 4.72 and then 4.80 I am really chuffed. "Training has been going great. I am in the best shape I have ever been in. I just need to stay healthy, keep sharp and build momentum going into the majors." Media playback is not supported on this device Jonnie Peacock eased to victory in the T44 men's 100m in 10.92 seconds, accelerating to pull well ahead of his three challengers. South Africa's Arnu Fourie was second (11.25secs), with Michail Seitis third (11.39) and Italy's Emanuele di Marino fourth (12.18). "We had a massive shift on technical aspects last year and had just six months to get them right before the Olympics but we improved a lot," Peacock told BBC Sport. "I still have a lot to improve. My first five metres today were terrible." Sophie Kamlish made it a British double in the event with victory in the T44 women's 100m, beating Dutch three-time Paralympic gold medallist Marlou van Rhijn by 0.02secs in a time of 13.24. On the specially laid track on Deansgate, Asha Philip pipped Australian Sally Pearson to the win the women's 100m in a time of 11.48secs. Pearson made up for that disappointment by winning the final race of the evening - the 100m hurdles - in 12.81secs. Another Briton, James Dasaolu, clocked 10.25 to take the men's 100m after 41-year-old Kim Collins, who claimed gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, pulled up with cramp. American Johnny Dutch, who was coaxed out of retirement last year, impressed in the men's 200m hurdles with a time of 22.48secs, comfortably beating a British trio led by Sebastian Rodger (22.89). There was a surprise result in the men's 150m as Greece's Lykourgos-Stefanos Tsakonas claimed a personal best of 15.04secs to see off the challenge of Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who also ran a PB of 15.22. Fellow Briton Richard Kilty was third in 15.43.	Britain's Greg Rutherford claimed a resounding long-jump victory at the Great City Games in front of a big crowd in Manchester's Albert Square.
FirstGroup takes over on Sunday amid ongoing disputes over driver-operated doors and the role of train guards. The company said it would be "retaining a second person" on board trains. The RMT union said in talks the firm refused to provide a guarantee "despite what they have been telling the press". FirstGroup and Hong Kong company MTR will provide 90 new trains by December 2020 with doors that can be operated by the driver. Franchise managing director Andy Mellors said: "Our commitment with the 750 new carriages for the suburban routes out of Waterloo is that we will be retaining a second person on board those trains." But following talks the RMT said FirstGroup altered the wording to say it was "planning" to keep a second person. General secretary Mick Cash said: "The company refused to give a guarantee that there will be a second person â€Žon their trains despite what they have been telling the press. "They also failed to clarify what safety competencies and role a second member of staff would have on their services." The union sees a second member of staff on board its trains as "critical" to passenger safety. In an earlier BBC interview, Mr Mellors said the new trains would "retain a second person" on board, but could not say what that person's role would be. A company statement said: "We know that a second member of staff provides assurance to our passengers on trains and ensures we have capable colleagues on board to deliver assistance during the journey for anyone that needs help or advice while travelling on our trains." Disputes over driver-only operated trains on other rail services have led to 16 months of industrial action by the RMT. The South Western rail service currently operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight.	The new South Western rail franchise holder has been criticised by a union for allegedly refusing to guarantee a second staff member on board its forthcoming trains.
Police hope the scheme will help reduce financial crime by spotting scams before money has been handed over. The plan is to train every single front-facing employee of banks, building societies and Post Offices. Cash payments to fraudsters are typically much harder to trace than online payments with the vast majority of cases going unsolved. Typical frauds of this kind include paying rogue builders, romance scams and elderly abuse. 'It just didn't add up' Staff at one bank which has trialled the scheme helped stop a customer being swindled out of £13,000. Ray, who is in his 60s, was approached by a builder at his home in London about some work on his house. He had withdrawn £6,000 from his local branch after explaining to staff what it was going to be used for. But when he returned a week later to take out another £13,000 he was recognised by staff member Ann-Marie. She asked him questions about his cash withdrawal which raised suspicions. Ray handed over the flier he had been given with the builder's contact details and staff gave him a call. Ann-Marie added: "The person that answered wasn't very professional and the alarm bells started to ring. Plus the amount he [Ray] wanted to cash and the work he needed done just didn't add up." Staff contacted the police who visited Ray the next day when the builder was at his property. Officers did a background check on the builder and which uncovered suspicious activity and he was arrested. The new scheme, known as the Banking Protocol, is aimed at ensuring banks and police are more active in protecting customers. It is being run as a joint venture between the police, Financial Fraud Action - which represents banks - and Trading Standards. All customer-facing bank staff will be told to look out for specific signs that a client may be the victim of ongoing fraud. If they have suspicions, they are encouraged to call the police and give a special password. Police trained under the protocol will also commit to investigating the fraud as a priority - often visiting the bank branch, or the customer's home, immediately. In some cases, they may be able to catch the criminal waiting outside the bank or the victim's home to collect the cash. Bank staff taking part in the trial scheme in London made 178 calls to police which resulted in 16 arrests. Banks say £1.4m has already been stopped from leaving customer accounts. Police, Financial Fraud Action and Trading Standards have hailed the trial a success. The scheme is expected to begin in the next few weeks with the first 16 police forces trained by the end of June.	All bank staff are to be trained to spot signs that a customer may be withdrawing cash to give to a scammer.
This is the new Virtual Reality (VR) version of Google Earth, as seen through the HTC Vive headset. The way the HTC Vive's works means that as well as moving your head around to get different views, you can walk around your surroundings, try to see into Buckingham Palace or fly up to the top of the Eiffel Tower. But while Google Earth's coverage of many of the Earth's cities and famous landmarks look great in VR, if you just wanted to explore your street, the VR experience might not be so good... yet... The HTC VIVE is one of the latest VR headsets on the market, and we asked Newsrounders to check some of them out. Virtual reality is still pretty new, and scientists aren't sure how it will affect people's health in the long-term, especially eyesight. So most VR makers have guidelines which recommend that only people over the age of 13 play them. Some people have also reported feeling a bit seasick whilst playing on them.	Check out these superhero-eye views of cities around the world!
Sgt Jon Harris had been sent to an alleged assault in the Waterloo Bar in Argyle Street on Wednesday night. After dealing with the incident he surprised customers by belting out the classic 70s track on the karaoke. Peter McKenna-Boyd, who filmed the performance, said: "Everybody just loved it". The officer was in full uniform at the time. Mr McKenna-Boyd told BBC Radio Scotland's The Kaye Adams programme: "Nobody expected it to happen. It was just a normal Wednesday night for us. "They've just launched their new wacky Wednesday which is a bit of a game show and a bit of karaoke." "I think the sergeant was speaking to the karaoke host and she suggested he got up to sing but I don't think she expected him to," Mr McKenna-Boyd said. "But she held him to it just before he went out the door. The other officers were outside and they heard his name called up and they ran straight back in. "They loved it as well. Everybody was clapping and cheering for him. "He was hilarious, especially his pointing and his dance moves. The other policemen were standing and clapping and cheering. Not sure if he was their boss but when they first saw him it was like their dad had just got up on the karaoke." Ch Insp Mark Sutherland, of Police Scotland, said: "Around 19.10 hours on Wednesday evening, officers were called following an alleged assault within the Waterloo Bar on Argyle Street in Glasgow city centre. "A full and thorough investigation led to the arrest of a 23-year-old male who is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on 2nd June. "Once the inquiry had concluded and the victim's safety ensured, Sgt Jon Harris from our city centre community policing team was encouraged to participate in karaoke ongoing in the pub. 'Sgt Jon' took to the stage which helped to defuse any simmering tensions in the pub. "I was pleased to see that once the incident had been professionally concluded, my officers were able to share a lighter moment with those who remained in the pub."	A police sergeant called out to deal with a brawl in a Glasgow pub ended up giving an arresting performance of Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive.
Resuming on 193-7, still needing 65 to make the visitors bat again, Leach (90) and Barnard (42) put on 100 to help Worcestershire post 349. Leach then claimed two wickets to leave the Foxes wobbling on 43-2. But Paul Horton (75*) and Mark Cosgrove (58*) saw Leicestershire to the close on 172-2, a healthy lead of 230. In company with fellow former Shropshire all-rounder Barnard, Leach fell just 10 runs short of his first century for three years. Despite Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay taking a tidy 4-59 from 24.1 overs, it left Worcestershire only 58 in arrears on first innings. Leach then broke through in each of his opening two overs as Angus Robson slashed a delivery to point before first-innings centurion Neil Dexter was brilliantly stumped by Ben Cox. But captain Cosgrove and former Lancashire skipper Horton got on top to leave the visitors, who started the game 13 points ahead of the home side in fourth, pushing for a third Championship win of the campaign. Worcestershire all-rounder Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "It has been pretty good old-fashioned attritional cricket throughout the day. The pitch dictates that to a certain extent. It is not the quickest and with not much going on for the seam bowlers or the spinners. "We were up against it after the poor session we had on Monday evening so, to stay in the game, it was imperative that we had a good morning with the bat and got as close as we could to them. "It is mine and Ed Barnard's natural game to try and get on with it and, in the end, we can be satisfied with finishing 50-odd behind on first innings from the position we got ourselves into." Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester: "It didn't go probably as well as we hoped this morning but that's cricket and they batted very well and we probably weren't at our best with the ball. The game drifted away from us quite a bit. "But we bounced back after lunch, got a couple of quick wickets and batted quite nicely in the final session to set ourselves up for going into day four. "With my four wickets, there were a couple of lucky ones in there but it is a hard slog. You get wickets like that now and then.  It is all about running in and making it as hard as we can for the batters."	Leicestershire have the upper hand at New Road, despite Worcestershire being spared a possible innings defeat by Joe Leach and Ed Barnard's century stand.
Microsoft has revealed details of a login system for the next version of Windows based around pictures a user stores on a touchscreen device. Only when parts of an image are tapped or touched in the right order will a user be able to access a device. Experts said it might stop people using weak passwords but could lead to other loopholes that are harder to solve. Microsoft aired the idea of using images to sign on to a device via a blog written by engineers working on Windows 8 - the next version of the Windows operating system expected to be released in late 2012. Windows 8 is designed for touchscreen devices such as tablets and the novel sign-on systems makes use of the sensitive displays they are likely to sport. The familiar process of getting to use a desktop PC or laptop by typing in a password made of up lower and upper case letters as well as numbers was felt to be too "cumbersome" for tablets,wrote Microsoft engineer Zach Pace on the blog. The replacement system proposed by Microsoft employs a picture chosen by a user from their collection of images on a device. On this image, users are encouraged to tap on, underline or circle the parts that are important to them. The sequence of gestures, including start and end positions and orientation act as a key to unlock the device. User-testing suggests that the image-based system can grant access to a portable gadget far faster than was possible through text-based passwords, wrote Mr Pace. He stressed that the system would work alongside text-based passwords rather than replace them. If a user failed to properly reproduce the correct gestures fives times in a row they would be prompted for the password they set up when they first used the device. The permutations of taps, touches and circles that could be drawn on a picture was likely to be far higher than those available from text-based passwords, said Prof Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey. That was especially true, he said, when one considered the limited number of words from which most people picked their passwords. "The initial calculations show that it is likely to provide a level of security that is at least as strong as a password, and frankly, stronger than most passwords chosen by users," he added. Graham Cluley, senior security researcher at Sophos, said the research was "interesting and cute" but may introduce other security problems. It could, he said, make people vulnerable to "shoulder surfing" - a practice better known from cash machines where crooks try to spot a victim's Pin as they tap it into a number pad. "With normal password entry, what you're doing is asterisked on the screen," said Mr Cluley. "With this gesture input, folks may find it easier to see the movements you are making." There might be more value in operating systems encouraging people to use stronger passwords by refusing to let them use dictionary words or ones that are easy to crack, he added.	Using Windows 8 devices could involve signing on by tapping, circling or touching images.
The St Athan Search and Rescue Helicopter Service was officially launched on Thursday. From its £7m Vale of Glamorgan base, it will conduct land and sea missions previously carried out by the RAF. It started operating on 4 October and has so far completed eight missions. The new base is one of 10 being set up around the UK by 2017, with 22 helicopters set to conduct land and sea searches on behalf of HM Coastguard. A ten-year contract was awarded by the Department for Transport to Bristow Helicopters to deliver the service. Two of the new bases are in Wales, with one in Caernarfon, Gwynedd replacing RAF Valley and St Athan covering an area once served by helicopters from RAF Chivenor in Devon. There are two Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters based at St Athan, each worth around £7.5m and fitted with night vision and state-of-the art medical equipment. "We aim to be ready to fly within 15 minutes of the call in the day and 45 minutes at night. But for the last emergency we were airborne in seven minutes," said Capt Olly Padbury. "We also had a call within 45 minutes of going live on 4 October, so it shows the importance of the service." The 30-person team will be on 24-hour call and cover an area that runs roughly between mid Wales, Bude in Cornwall, Oxford and London. Capt Padbury said the base's location meant the two helicopters could get quickly to areas that receive large amounts of emergency calls- such as Worm's Head on Gower, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Woolacombe Beach in Devon. Moving at speeds of roughly 160mph, the crew travelled to Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, in seven minutes to answer a call of a man stuck in mud recently. Other call-outs have been to a horse rider who fell in west Wales and someone who had fallen at Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. Another recent mission was to aid the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team, who made an emergency call after a walker fell near Ystradfellte, Powys and had a pelvis injury. Richard Parkes, the director of maritime operations at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, called the base launch a "bittersweet" moment. He praised the previous rescue work conducted from Chivenor, saying: "A high benchmark has been set by the RAF through 70 years of search and rescue. "The challenge is to emulate it."	Rescues of a fallen horse rider, someone trapped in a gorge and a man stuck in mud are among the first missions completed by a new helicopter unit.
Wick Joint Campus is being constructed to replace Wick High School and Pulteneytown and South primaries. It will also have community facilities which will be available to the public. Highland Council said its contractor Hub North Scotland (Wick) Ltd had informed it of delays affecting the completion of the site. The local authority said: "Regrettably it seems unlikely that the campus will be ready to open in October, as envisaged. "Highland Council intends the best facilities possible for children and staff, and will not accept these buildings until work is completed. "The council is working with the contractor to determine what the earliest possible date is for completion of the whole Wick Joint Campus project, and will make further announcements as soon as possible."	A new £48.5m school campus in the Highlands is unlikely to open in October as planned, Highland Council has said.
"I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night," Casey Anthony told the Associated Press, adding that she does not care "what anyone thinks about me". The 30-year-old complained about her portrayal in the media as a partying child-killer. Anthony was convicted of lying to police but acquitted of murder. Casey Anthony: The case that gripped the US If found guilty she could have faced the death penalty under Florida law. "My sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict. Sentence first, verdict afterward," she said. "People found me guilty long before I had my day in court." The 2011 case drew millions of viewers across the US, with every twist covered on live television. Anthony was dubbed "America's most hated mom" amid reports she went to nightclubs and got a tattoo in the month her daughter was missing. Last week the former judge that presided over the case spoke out to say that Anthony "more than likely" accidently killed her daughter by using too much chloroform to calm her before suffocating her with duct tape. During the trial, her defence argued that the girl drowned in the pool, and that Anthony and her father covered it up. The government failed to secure a conviction due to the lack of physical evidence tying her to Caylee's death. When asked about the drowning defence, Anthony hesitated. "Everyone has their theories, I don't know. As I stand here today I can't tell you one way or another. "The last time I saw my daughter I believed she was alive and was going to be OK, and that's what was told to me." She added: "Caylee would be 12 right now. And would be a total badass."	An Orlando mother who was found not guilty of murdering her two-year old daughter Caylee has broken her silence six years later.
The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The reactor was shut down in 2007 but Pyongyang said last year that it was operational again. It has since conducted its fourth test of a nuclear weapon. That and its multiple missile tests broke existing international sanctions and provoked further measures from the UN and individual countries. The IAEA has no access to North Korea after being thrown out in 2009,  so relies largely on satellite data. But the agency's head, Yukiya Amano, said recent images indicated "activities related to the five-megawatt reactor, expansion of enrichment facilities and activities related to reprocessing". Vehicles have also been seen moving at the site and there are indications of warm water being discharged, which would suggest cooling operations. Other North Korean observers have also said in recent months that the plant appears to be working again. At North Korea's recent ruling party congress, leader Kim Jong-un reinforced his policy of economic development coupled with a strong nuclear programme.	North Korea appears to have restarted its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.
Captain David Seath, 31, was a fire support team commander in 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery. He suffered a suspected cardiac arrest while running the course and later died in hospital. He was laid to rest following a funeral in St Margaret's RC Memorial Church in Dunfermline. Hundreds of mourners gathered at the church for the service, which was led by parish priest Father Chris Heenan. Capt Seath was originally from Cowdenbeath in Fife. Maj Jim McCaffery, 7 (Sphinx) Commando Battery, which is based in Arbroath, told the service:  "It is with great sadness that were are here today to say farewell to Captain David Seath. "David was an inspiration to all of us. I genuinely could not have wished for a finer officer. "He will be sorely missed and our thoughts and prayers are with his family." During the service, Capt James Walker-McClimens read a tribute on behalf of Capt Seath's brother, Gary. He told the mourners: "David was my hero and my inspiration. I was so proud to say that he was a Captain in 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and that he served his country with distinction in Afghanistan and the Middle East. "Words can't express how proud I was listening to him as he described his tours of Afghanistan and the Middle East. "I learnt so much about David's tours of duty, the strong bond of comradeship he had found in the Army as well as the many plans he had for the future. "There are no words to express how devastated I am that this story has so tragically ended, with so many chapters left unwritten." A family notice published in the Dunfermline Press said the service would be a "celebration of David's life" and urged mourners to wear bright colours. Capt Seath fell ill at the 23-mile mark while taking part in the race. Following his death, Capt Seath's friends and colleagues vowed to continue to raise money for Help for Heroes and walk the final three miles of the marathon course. More than Â£100,000 has been donated to a JustGiving page in his memory while about Â£80,000 has been raised for the charity on his own page.	The funeral of an Afghanistan veteran and Green Beret who died after collapsing during the London Marathon has been held in Dunfermline, Fife.
McAnuff, 31, joined the Royals in 2009 and has made 172 appearances since his arrival from Watford. He began his career at Wimbledon in 2001 and having played for West Ham, Cardiff and Crystal Palace, McAnuff is keen to finish at the Madejski Stadium. "From my point of view of course I would," McAnuff told BBC Radio Berkshire. The squad is so strong we have competition in every position and it is something we have to get on with and deal with "I've been on record numerous time saying how much I've enjoyed my time here and some of my best moments as a professional have been with this club. "But it's not my decision. All I can do is do as well as I can on the pitch, it is not solely down to me." McAnuff, who captained Reading in the Premier League last season, was on the substitutes' bench for their Championship opener against Ipswich but started at Bolton last weekend. Despite being disappointed at missing out on on a starting spot on the first day of the season, McAnuff is confident he can be a regular in the team. "In pre-season you come in and work hard and it is all geared up for that first game," he added. "So it's disappointing (not being selected) but that is football. The squad is so strong we have competition in every position and it is something we have to get on with and deal with. "The manager makes a point of saying it bears no meaning on the season, it is just a team to get the job done, and as you get older you see the bigger picture and for us this year it is going to be about every single player. "It is healthy (to have competition), I don't think any player should be guaranteed a place."	Reading winger Jobi McAnuff says he hopes to end his playing career at the Championship club.
Police said the man was arrested after a 54-year-old man died at St John's Hospital in Livingston. He had suffered head injuries during an incident in King Street, Bathgate, at about 03:00 on Saturday. Officers have appealed for witnesses to come forward. The arrested man is due to appear at Livingston Sheriff Court on Monday. Ch Insp Colin Gagen said officers would be carrying out high-profile patrols in the area and added: "This death is a tragedy and our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. "These types of incidents are thankfully rare and we are treating this death as an isolated case. "We will be undertaking extra patrols in the King Street area in order to provide community reassurance."	A 35-year-old man has been charged with murder following the death of a man in Bathgate.
Bempton Cliffs at Flamborough Head has the UK's largest mainland seabird colony, according to the RSPB. It said the new facilities would bring more visitors and improve their access to the thousands of nesting birds. Keith Clarkson, site manager, said: "It's absolutely fantastic. It's been 10 years in the making." The centre, which attracts about 76,000 people a year, has been closed since September for redevelopment. It now has a bigger reception, a sheltered place for education and space for community groups and family activities. The footpaths have been made more accessible and extra spaces provided in the car park. Its reopening coincides with the BBC's Springwatch programme, which is based at the nature reserve for its Easter show. Springwatch will be on BBC Two at 21:00 BST.	A visitor centre at an internationally important nature reserve in East Yorkshire has reopened after a £1.3m upgrade.
Fosse Park, near junction 21 of the M1, opened in 1989 and was bought in August for Â£345.5m. Plans are now being prepared to improve parking and traffic congestion and the appearance of units. Ernie White, leader of Blaby District Council, said the new owners had met with the council to clear up "potential planning questions". "Fosse Park is the gateway from Blaby into the city and they see it as an investment that they think they can improve," said Mr White. "I think it could be a better view when you come into the city, at the moment all you see are far too many backs of sheds." Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, said: "Two things we want to address are parking and congestion issues around the park and we believe it has become rather tired over the last few years. "We are very concerned to address the quality of what we call the common areas - where people have to walk and park - and the facilities available to make sure a location like Fosse Park is as good as it can be."	A Leicestershire retail park is to get an injection of investment after being purchased by the Crown Estate.
BBC Wiltshire report the 23-year-old forward left Sixfields before kick-off, having been told he wasn't involved in the squad for the League One match. Head coach Luke Williams said the matter would be dealt with "in house". The Robins are in the relegation zone after five straight losses, four points from safety, with 14 matches remaining. Swindon have won three, drawn four and lost 11 of their 18 games in all competitions since Tim Sherwood's appointment as director of football on 10 November.	Swindon Town's Jermaine Hylton may face internal disciplinary action after walking out on his side before Tuesday's 2-1 loss at Northampton Town.
More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say. Special Report: The Technology of Business Digital death of a business card? Mobile advertisers want your phone Rinsing your reputation the online way Mobile working comes of age Using voice to give your app the edge But Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system. On a visit to the company's headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers. And the striking thing about what Microsoft's research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect. The system which turns a player's body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company's three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies. Now they are looking at what Kinect could do next. We saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera. Other scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems. And there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person. Craig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off. "Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions," he says. "You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale." But Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs. Ever since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream. Peter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking. Professor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis. He cites the contribution to what he describes as the "holy war in search", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing. "Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product." But he thinks the long-term research is equally important. "Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge," he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize. His boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example. There is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where "the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf." It is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line. Big, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft. "We don't feel big and sleepy or dull," he responded, "but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view." And he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end. "I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies." Microsoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.	If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?
De Roon moved to Teesside in June 2016 for an initial £8.8m fee and played 33 Premier League games last term. The Netherlands international, 26, scored five goals in 36 league and cup games during his spell at Boro. Meanwhile, manager Garry Monk confirmed the Championship club's interest in signing Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker. "He's a target and one of many that we've had throughout the summer months," said Monk. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) made a number of recommendations including ensuring nursing staffing levels were safe at Sandwell General Hospital and City Hospital in Birmingham. It also called for improvements in A&E, medical care and surgery. Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust said it is "working hard already to address the issues". Care at the trust was given an overall rating of "requires improvement". The CQC said: "The trust was rated as 'inadequate' with regard to whether [it] was always providing a service that is safe." Source: CQC inspection between 14-17 and 25-30 October The trust said the report made for  "difficult reading". Chief executive Toby Lewis said: "The areas of improvement identified in the report are not a surprise to us at the trust, even where they are disappointing, or make difficult reading." CQC's chief inspector, Prof Sir Mike Richards, said: "While we witnessed areas of good practice it is clear that the trust has work to do to make improvements which are sustainable long term." Inspectors will return to check whether the necessary changes have taken place and the CQC will continue to monitor the trust "closely". Mr Lewis said: "During the CQC visit, inspectors saw some individual examples of poor practice in some departments around hand washing, security of medicines and completion of patient records." He said these individual examples "are not acceptable" and it is up to the trust leadership to ensure it gets "the basics right, first time, every time for every patient".	The safety of services at a trust running two hospitals has been rated "inadequate" by a health watchdog.
Almost 80,000 passengers and crew have sailed into Belfast this year on 43 different tourist ships. One of the big draws is the new Titanic Visitor Centre, which so far has welcomed people from 111 different countries. Belfast is no longer building ships, but it is now attracting them. The peace process has transformed the city. During the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s the cruise ship industry steered clear of Belfast. It was not until 1997 that modern luxury liners started sailing up Belfast Lough. In recent years, numbers have soared. Next year, more than 50 are expected. So what's the big attraction? The Giant's Causeway, golf and Titanic Belfast are pulling in the visitors. However, there is also a human factor - curiosity. Gerry Lennon, chief executive of the Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau, said: "Curiosity is a huge driver for tourism. A lot of people are curious about Belfast and Northern Ireland. "The political stability has given us that ability to go to the market-place and now say 'look what we have to offer'." The Glens of Antrim, the walls of Londonderry and Belfast's shopping districts are also proving popular. The recent three nights of rioting in one part of north Belfast do not seem to have put people off. Money has been invested in Belfast Harbour to ensure it can cope with the increasingly large vessels sailing into the city, including the latest arrival, the 113,000-tons Emerald Princess. Tony McAuley, commercial officer for Belfast Harbour, said: "Once we get people here, the facilities almost sell themselves." The Titanic Visitor Centre has attracted more than 500,000 visitors since it opened six months ago - double what was expected. The cruise ship business alone is worth an estimated Â£15m a year to Northern Ireland's economy. There is a certain novelty factor to Belfast at the moment. This will wear off in time. In the meantime, the city is enjoying riding the wave of international interest.

The Supreme Court case related to federal law limiting gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence. Justice Thomas has said in the past he prefers not to "badger" lawyers as they present their arguments in court. He spoke weeks after the death of one of the most conservative Supreme Court members, Justice Antonin Scalia, which may shift the court's balance of power. Justice Thomas on Monday asked a lawyer for the Department of Justice whether the violation of any law "suspends a [person's] constitutional rights". The court is considering placing new limits on the reach of the federal law banning people convicted of domestic violence from owning guns. It was the court's second week of oral arguments - when justices are given the chance to question lawyers about their briefs - since the death of Justice Scalia, a friend and fellow conservative of Justice Thomas. The last time he was reported to have asked a question at the high court was during a death penalty case in February 2006. Explaining his silence over the years, Justice Thomas told the Associated Press in 2013: "We have a lifetime to go back in chambers and to argue with each other." He told a group of students in 2000 that "there's no reason to add to the volume. I also believe strongly, unless I want an answer, I don't ask things... Usually, if you wait long enough, someone will ask your question".	Justice Clarence Thomas, one of eight judges at the highest court in the US, has broken a 10-year silence at court.
There are thought to have been as many as 200m downloads of period tracking apps worldwide. But a leading UK medical royal college has warned that women should not rely on them as a form of contraception. And privacy campaigners say users should be wary of what data they might unwittingly be sharing when they download some apps. A search for period tracking apps will quickly bring up dozens of offerings - some with charts, others illustrated with pink tulips or lilac flowers. In the health and fitness category, period trackers come second only to apps which monitor running. Amy Worsfold, from Greenwich, south-east London, has used different trackers for three years. She is a soprano opera singer. Amy told me: "When you are starting your period or you're pre-menstrual, the hormones that rush around your body affect your larynx in ways that are detrimental to your singing voice. "I use the app to avoid auditions, premieres or really important performances on those days if I can." She plots and predicts her cycle on her smartphone. The app also helps her identify connections with changes in her emotions, eating habits and headaches. Amy added: "Being able to chart what happens to you and how you uniquely respond to your cycle is a great way of taking ownership of something that really sucks - but is completely necessary." Sometimes women download period trackers to monitor their fertility. But the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned they should not be used as a form of contraception. Only one such app on the market has been independently evaluated for effectiveness in this area. Generally, they are not classed as medical devices, which would involve stricter regulation. Ida Tin is the Berlin-based Danish entrepreneur behind an app called Clue. Around 10% of her market is in the UK. She said: "I wanted to develop the next generation of technology for family planning - and I do believe we'll get there. But we're not there yet." Women in Mexico and Brazil have recently shown huge interest in Clue, possibly because of fears about getting pregnant during the Zika virus outbreak. Ida Tin is interested in how anonymised user data from her free app can be used for the greater good. To this end, she is collaborating with medical researchers at Oxford University. She has built her business on a responsible approach. She added: "The app is a very powerful tool. I can't do what our users want me to do unless I use their data. "I appreciate I'm asking people for a lot of trust in me, but a lot of companies [in the same line of work as mine] don't honour that trust." Some apps which are more firmly pointed at conception have a clear value to advertisers - as a woman planning a baby is a potential market for prams, clothing and many other purchases. Sam Smith is a privacy campaigner at medConfidential. He said: "For all medical apps, but especially for conception apps, there needs to be a source people can trust that's independent and says this app is safe for you. "You can read the terms and conditions - and legally you are required to. But everybody knows that nobody does." He sees the lack of regulation, or even official recommendation, as a market failure in this area. His advice is that if an app is free, consider whether you are paying for it in effect by giving away your data - and investigate where it might be going.	The market is booming in apps which offer women the chance to monitor the cycles of their monthly periods.
They began the third day 75 runs behind with five first-innings wickets in hand. For them to win on the same evening is not quite unprecedented, but certainly highly unusual, especially in the age of covered pitches. At lunchtime, South Africa were basically level with all 10 wickets intact. It was their opportunity to bat England out of the game. Instead, less than two sessions later, they were beaten. It was incredible. The catalyst for it all was Stuart Broad. As soon as he starts lifting those knees up and running in hard, batsmen are in trouble. Media playback is not supported on this device His 5-1 in 31 balls is the seventh time he has taken five wickets in a single spell of bowling. Those are match-winning performances. He was helped by conditions - the clouds hung around, the floodlights were on all day, the new ball was venomous and brutal. But the bowler still has to put the ball in the right place and, in those circumstances, Broad is a formidable man to face. It wasn't just the deliveries that took wickets that were dangerous - some were flying past the nose, others were crashing into flesh. South Africa will not only be suffering the pain of defeat, but also the bruises of leather on skin. These spells that Broad bowls - The Oval in 2009, Chester-le-Street in 2013, Trent Bridge in 2015 and now here - are symptomatic of his character. If your team is in a situation where someone needs to stand up and be counted, then Broad wants to be that man. He uses all of his 6ft 6in to get bounce, but also swings and seams the ball as well. He's accurate, so builds pressure. On top of that, he loves to get in your face and under your skin. Broad, though, is just one of the players capable of turning a Test for England. In fact, I'm willing to stick my neck out and say that it is unusual for England to be blessed with so many match-winners. Broad, Ben Stokes and Joe Root can all turn the momentum in a session. We know what a fully fit James Anderson is capable of and Steven Finn showed during the Ashes that he can bowl a magic spell. This ability to turn a Test from a position of peril began for England back in the summer. On the first morning against New Zealand at Lord's, England found themselves 30-4, only for Root and Stokes to counter-attack. For years, England had it done to them - think of the havoc that Australia's Adam Gilchrist used to cause. Now, England are doing it to other teams with a great deal of flair and courage. They are a team on the up and one I fancied to beat South Africa, who, in contrast, are a team in decline. The Proteas may have started the series ranked number one, but we knew they were no longer the world's outstanding team. Yes, they have been deprived of Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander - and it is a shame that England did not have the chance to beat a full-strength South Africa - but that might not have made a difference. South Africa simply did not have the chance to get over their humbling in India and therefore carried the scars into this series. England had the opportunity to draw a line under their defeat against Pakistan in the UAE, a series where they far from disgraced themselves. Looking ahead, England have two home series in the summer that they should win. The last time Sri Lanka were in England, they won, so Alastair Cook has a score to settle there and some ranking points to win back. You never know which Pakistan will turn up, but England will again be favourites. They then go to Bangladesh, which will be good preparation for a formidable trip to India, the new world number ones. Then again, England won the last time they were there too. These things go in cycles and, in English cricket, we tend to look forward to the Ashes as a marker and a time to be judged. The next date with Australia is at the end of 2017, down under. Almost two years out, England look well-placed. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt	England's victory in the third Test against South Africa in Johannesburg was quite remarkable.
The art of Kremlinology has moved on since then. And I'm proud to say I've come up with my own 21st Century method for keeping up to date with the current thinking in the corridors of Russian power: it involves walking to the train station opposite the BBC Moscow office, going up to the souvenir stand and looking at the fridge magnets on sale. You can tell a lot from Russian fridge magnets. This week's selection includes several different "Vladimir Putin in military camouflage" magnets, complete with patriotic slogans, like: "Together we are a force to be reckoned with!" and "We will always look out for our guys!" Kremlin policy in a nutshell. One fridge magnet in particular caught my eye. It looks just like a $100 bill but, in place of the American founding father Benjamin Franklin, there is a portrait of Vladimir Putin. I know. It's only a fridge magnet. But it encapsulates the whole Putin-Trump/Russia-America saga. After six months of Donald Trump in the White House, Russians are beginning to feel that their country enjoys considerable influence over America. And who could blame them for thinking that? Particularly in light of allegations of the Kremlin hacking a US election and putting a Russian puppet in the White House, and with all the rumours of Russian lawyers, Russian lobbyists and Russian oligarchs conspiring with the Trump team and the Trump family. It will be up to official investigations to establish whether there was, indeed, collusion. But even the suggestion that there may have been has got the whole world talking about the power of Putin's Russia and the weakness of Trump's America. There are times when Vladimir Putin seems to be basking in the infamy of running a cyber superpower. There is just one problem for President Putin. It's the problem of all fridge magnets, really. They look so pretty when you buy them in the shop. But they don't stick to every fridge. When it began, Donald Trump's presidency looked very pretty to Moscow. The Russians expected that America's new leader would herald a new era in US-Russian cooperation. At the time, a news anchor on Russian State TV described Trump as "an Alpha male... a real man." The day after America's presidential election, one Russian state official told me that she had celebrated Trump's victory with a cigar and a bottle of champagne. But, after six months of President Trump, US sanctions against Russia remain in place. The two Russian diplomatic compounds, closed by President Obama last December, remain shut. And the idea of a "Grand Deal" with America, much hoped for here at the start of the Trump presidency, has disappeared from the pages of the Russian dailies. Moscow is not blaming Donald Trump directly for this. One Russian newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, explained recently that, in the current atmosphere, "Trump doesn't have the slightest possibility to improve Russian-US relations, since any step, any glance even in the direction of Russia is met with suspicion back home and even viewed as treason." A few days ago I was chatting to a Russian senator. He complained that the intense pressure President Trump was facing over the Russia question was complicating US-Russian diplomacy. "Trump is like a prisoner," he told me, "And how can you talk to a prisoner?" But Russia and America are talking. Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have now met, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. And, although progress is slower than Moscow would like, there is cautious talk of cooperation: in Syria, for example, and in the area of cyber security. Mr Trump continues to argue there is nothing wrong in seeking a closer relationship with Russia. He insists it is in America's interest to do so. And, while America's president and America's Western allies often appear poles apart on a variety of issues, Donald Trump seems drawn like a magnet to Vladimir Putin. Indeed, he has openly praised the Kremlin leader. Yet Russia is casting a shadow over the US administration. For Donald Trump, could this prove to be a fatal attraction?	There was a time when to work out what was happening in Moscow you needed to read between the lines in Pravda, or look at the line-up of Soviet officials at a Red Square parade and study who was standing next to whom.
The victim, aged 62, had been stabbed in his chest and neck and had a bite mark on his face, the police told the BBC. The suspect, a Zimbabwean national, was found in the Gugulethu township near Cape Town. He is due to be formally charged in court later on Thursday or Friday. Western Cape Deputy Police Commissioner Sharon Jephta said police officers and witnesses had been offered counselling to cope with the trauma. "It was very gruesome," she said. "It's definitely a love triangle," she said.	South African police have arrested a man they found using a knife and fork to eat the heart of his ex-girlfriend's new lover.
5 January 2016 Last updated at 10:38 GMT It is not known how the swan got trapped on the rooftop of Agatha's Boutique but it could not fly off as it did not have enough space to take enough of a run up. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: "Happily we were able to rescue this swan and release it back into the wild just a short distance away." Staff at nearby soundLINCS managed to record the successful rescue.	An RSPCA worker has rescued an adult male swan from the roof of a building in the centre of Lincoln.
Police issued an alert after a complaint was made that two men were acting suspiciously near secondary schools in Carrickfergus. Mysterious pictures online of a clown and a balaclava-wearing sidekick have caused a stir in the town. The police appeal caused a backlash on social media from some people who felt they were cracking down on fun. Police said they started an investigation after receiving reports from parents that their children were frightened of the clown. A police officer wrote on the PSNI Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus Facebook page: "Fun is fun but frightening school pupils is another." The mystery man, who calls himself the Carrick "Killer Clown", contacted the police following the appeal to apologise for any distress. "He assures me that this was a prank and it was not his intention in any way to frighten the school pupils or cause distress," the officer wrote. "He fully appreciates the sensitivities of schools and photographs etc in the area of any school." Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme the clown said he had been sent messages from people concerned about their children. "That wasn't the aim. The aim was for a bit of fun. I'm a parent myself," he said. "We thought this was a wonderful idea - to go and get this picture and it was only when somebody voiced their concern I was like 'this is actually wrong, this isn't even funny'. "I was talking to the police officer in charge again. I offered to go to the schools and apologize to the heads, obviously in my plain clothes, and he spoke to the heads on my behalf and they were happy with the apology through the police. So hopefully the parents will get that relayed to them." Earlier, a post on Carrick Killer Clowns' Facebook page read: "Due to the mixed response to the school pictures they have been removed - this whole thing is supposed to be a laugh and some parents find this distasteful and unfunny." However, they later posted a picture of themselves standing outside the police station in Carrickfergus.	A clown has turned himself in to the police after alarm was raised among frightened parents in County Antrim.

Campaigners have asked the university to reconsider the move, highlighting its "strong record" in educating people from disadvantaged groups. But the university says it needs to reduce costs in line with its student numbers. University and College Union (UCU) members will meet later to discuss what form the action should take. Two-thirds (67%) of UCU members voted for strike action. Members of its sister union UNISON are voting in a separate ballot, closing on 22 May. Both academic and professional support workers' posts will be closed under the university's proposals. Staff and students will also lobby the university's board of governors at their general meeting on Tuesday. Campaigners argue that the university has a track record in "providing educational opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged groups in society". They say in the academic year starting September 2012, nearly half the students at London Met were from minority ethnic groups, compared with 16% of university students nationally. In addition, about half were from the poorest groups in society. UCU's regional official Barry Jones said: "Nobody wants to be on strike and we remain open to sitting down to explore a better way forward than these job losses. "Far from further cutbacks, this university is in desperate need of investment to expand access to education." A university spokesman said its costs were too high. "We therefore need to reduce our cost structure to be more in line with our student numbers, as well as universities in the capital similar to London Met," he said.	Teaching and support staff at London Metropolitan University have voted to strike in protest over 165 job cuts.
Scientists agree that such attacks are extremely rare - and that sharks are not the man-eaters depicted in Hollywood blockbusters such as Jaws. But they will try to determine why the sharks were lured into shallow waters, and what prompted them to carry out a series of attacks that left one person dead and several more injured. So far, two sharks - an oceanic white tip and a mako shark - have been caught by local fishermen, but experts say there is no evidence so far that either of them are responsible for the attacks. There is an abundance of oceanic white tip sharks - Carcharhinus longimanus - in the Red Sea. Divers have spoken of diving with oceanic white tips without feeling threatened. Sources: International Union for Conservation of Nature and International Shark Attack Files But Ian Fergusson, a shark biologist and patron of the Shark Trust, a UK conservation organisation, said the presence of the short-fin mako shark was intriguing. Oceanic white tips frequent the region but it was unusual for swimmers to encounter them in shallow waters, he said, and it was very rare for shortfin makos to be found in the Red Sea - and exceptionally rare to find them close to shore. He said the last time a short-fin mako attacked in the area was in 1970s, when a tourist was wounded in an attack off Eilat's reefs. Mr Fergusson, a regular visitor to the area, said it would not be difficult for a shark to get close to the shore in Sharm el-Sheikh. "That particular part of the coastline is bordering on deep water. You don't have to go far offshore to find yourself in 500 metres of water. Sharks can get within half a mile of the shore easily. They don't, for example, have to cross reefs to get there." According to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack Files, there are an estimated 70-100 shark attacks on humans per year, resulting in about five to 15 deaths. Of those, the oceanic white tip is responsible for only a small number. But the large oceanic sharks were also the main culprits behind countless attacks on sailors and airmen who, after air and sea battles, found themselves adrift in the Pacific during World War II. So what could have prompted the latest attacks? There has been speculation that animal carcasses were recently dumped into the Red Sea, not far off the shore. Some reports have suggested the remains could have been thrown overboard by a ship carrying animal cargo. "If you start dumping carcasses, you couldn't ask for a better way of baiting for sharks," said Mr Fergusson. David Jacoby, who specialises in shark behavioural ecology at The Marine Biological Association of the UK, agreed that if this is the case, it was likely to be a significant factor in the sharks' behaviour. "Pelagic, or oceanic, species of shark often feed opportunistically because the open ocean can be a sparse environment for food," he said. While less is known about the movements and behaviour of the oceanic white tip, compared with some other species, Mr Jacoby offered another possible explanation as to why the sharks might have been in shallow water. Based on evidence, experts know that in other shark species, larger females move into warmer, shallow waters to either aid gestation - which can be between 9-12 months in white tips depending on the temperature - or to pup, although from what little evidence there is, it seems that oceanic white tips probably pup in the early summer. "Both species [white tips and makos] rarely encounter people as they spend large amounts of their time in blue water - open ocean," said Mr Jacoby. "Like other species, the oceanic white tip is opportunistic and can be fairly aggressive. It is hard to speculate why they attack but they might if they felt they were threatened. "They are not coming specifically to attack humans - they are not seen as a food source. But if a white tip or mako felt threatened, felt cornered by lots of people in the water, or next to a reef, for example, it might display more aggressive behaviour as a defence mechanism. "They are opportunistic and it could just be a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time." Or, he said, they could be cases of mistaken identity - the shark misinterpreting a human for its normal prey. Mr Jacoby said shiny objects in the water could attract attention from sharks - so if the sharks were already in the area, shiny jewellery might be a trigger. There has also been speculation that sharks could have have moved to shallow water because of the depletion of local food sources in the area, but Mr Jacoby disagrees with this. "This would surely have the opposite effect," he said. He explains that sharks adopt search behaviour aiming to maximise their encounters with food sources. Therefore, there is likely to be a relationship between natural prey distributions - fish, squid etc - and shark distributions, as the sharks generally try and go where the food is. However, if a potential food source such as carcasses have been discarded close to shore, some sharks would naturally pick up on this and opportunistically feed there. This would increase the numbers of sharks in the area, making interactions with people more likely. In the past, shark attacks on snorkellers have been blamed on shoddy diving practices such as "chumming" - attracting sharks by throwing solid bait or pouring chum, a mash of fish oil and blood, into the water. This type of activity aims to attract sharks such as oceanic white tips, which tend to stay out in the ocean. But Mr Fergusson said he didn't "buy" this theory. "Recent studies in South Africa have shown that chumming has limited effect on shark behaviour. "This is partly because these sharks are such migratory species, and mainly because this is a Marine National Park, any feeding is prohibited - anyone found doing it would be arrested and jailed." He said a more compelling argument could be a continued decline in pelagic fish stocks having an impact on the natural foraging behaviour of certain shark species. While any degradation to the ecosystem of the local reef wouldn't necessarily affect the oceanic white tip because this is outside of its natural habitat, Mr Fergusson said this could "point to a larger issue of general offshore fishing of tuna and other big fish whittling down and influencing the food chain". In Egypt, the hunt is still on for the shark that carried out the latest, fatal attack. Mark Murphy, who runs a scuba diving holiday firm in London, told the BBC that the local authorities would probably aim to have a "quick clean-up of the area". "There are over four million visitors a year to the Red Sea and there hasn't been a single incident within the last five years," said Mr Murphy. "I am saddened that the Egyptian government has decided to slaughter sharks indiscriminately. Over 70 million sharks a year are killed by humans and they are an essential part of the marine ecosystem." In any case, according to US-based shark expert Samuel Gruber, finding the predator or predators would be extremely difficult.	International shark experts are arriving in Egypt to help investigate the attacks off the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh that have baffled local officials.

"As a result of standing water on the pitch and the forecasted heavy rain the game has been postponed," said a statement on the Macclesfield website. A new date for the fixture has yet to be agreed.	The National League game between Macclesfield Town and Dover Athletic has been called off because of a waterlogged pitch.
The artificial intelligence system - LipNet - watches video of a person speaking and matches the text to the movement of their mouths with 93% accuracy, the researchers said. Automating the process could help millions, they suggested. But experts said the system needed to be tested in real-life situations. Lip-reading is a notoriously tricky business with professionals only able to decipher what someone is saying up to 60% of the time. "Machine lip-readers have enormous potential, with applications in improved hearing aids, silent dictation in public spaces, covert conversations, speech recognition in noisy environments, biometric identification and silent-movie processing," wrote the researchers. They said that the AI system was provided with whole sentences so that it could teach itself which letter corresponded to which lip movement. To train the AI, the team - from Oxford University's AI lab - fed it nearly 29,000 videos, labelled with the correct text. Each video was three seconds long and followed a similar grammatical pattern. While human testers given similar videos had an error rate of 47.7%, the AI had one of just 6.6%. The fact that the AI learned from specialist training videos led some on Twitter to criticise the research. Writing in OpenReview, Neil Lawrence pointed out that the videos had "limited vocabulary and a single syntax grammar". "While it's promising to perform well on this data, it's not really groundbreaking. While the model may be able to read my lips better than a human, it can only do so when I say a meaningless list of words from a highly constrained vocabulary in a specific order," he writes. The project was partially funded by Google's artificial intelligence firm DeepMind.	Scientists at Oxford University have developed a machine that can lip-read better than humans.
The accident happened as the train was departing Leuven station at a slow speed heading towards the capital. Emergency services were quick to arrive at the scene of the crash, which happened at 12:20 GMT on Saturday. The damaged carriage could be seen on its side part way down a slope. Services between Leuven and Brussels have been suspended, officials say. Last June at least three people were killed and nine injured in a train crash in the town of Hermalle-sous-Huy, near Liege. In February 2010, 18 people were killed when two passenger trains collided at Halle, south-west of the capital, Brussels.	At least one person has been killed and about 20 injured when a train carriage fell on to its side following a derailment close to the Belgian capital Brussels, railway officials say.
The shipment will be the first potentially preventative medicine to reach one of the hardest hit countries. But experts say that, with Ebola cases falling, it may be difficult to establish whether the jab offers any protection against the virus. It has been produced by British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the US National Institutes of Health. GSK said a plane carrying some 300 initial doses of the vaccine was expected to arrive in Monrovia on Friday. And the company hopes the first volunteer will be immunised in the next few weeks. The chief executive of GSK, Sir Andrew Witty, said the pace of development was almost unparalleled and was comparable to only the development of a pandemic flu vaccine or new medicines for HIV. He told the BBC: "As an example we have delayed two other vaccine development programmes to free up the space to do this work, so this has come with a significant amount of disruption." Scientists aim to involve 30,000 volunteers in the trial in total, including frontline health workers. If all regulations are met, 10,000 volunteers will be given the GSK vaccine. A matching number will get a placebo, dummy vaccine. And there are plans for a further 10,000 people to get a separate experimental jab. The results will be compared to see if either vaccine offers any meaningful protection against the virus. A version of the vaccine has already been tested on 200 healthy volunteers across the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali. GSK says it has been found to have an acceptable safety profile so far. But it is only in affected countries that experts can determine whether it provides adequate protection against the virus. Dr Moncef Slaoui, of GlaxoSmithKline said: "Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine. "The initial phase one data we have seen are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing." The company stresses the vaccine is still in development and the World Health Organization, and other regulators, would have to be satisfied the vaccine is both safe and effective before any mass immunisation campaigns could be considered. Field trials of other promising vaccines - for example one involving the company Merck - are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the months to come. And there are reports that a trial of an experimental drug called Zmapp might start in the next few weeks. However, experts say with the number of Ebola cases falling opportunities to test vaccines and drugs could be limited. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virus expert based at Nottingham University, told the BBC: "Because case numbers are starting to come down it will become harder and harder to show if the vaccine is having any impact. "Ultimately we may be in position in a few months time where we don't know whether this vaccine is effective in humans. "But it is important to get answers if we can - if not for this outbreak, for future outbreaks. We need to be prepared."	The first batch of an experimental vaccine against Ebola is on its way to Liberia.
Shillington, who made 90 appearances in the 50-over format, will continue to play Twenty20 internationals. The 36-year-old scored 1,276 runs, including six half-centuries, in an ODI career which began in August 1997. Ireland, already out of contention for a World Cup place, lost by 36 runs in a rain-affected contest in Colombo. The Irish were bowled out for 166 with a ball of their 50 overs to spare, with Malahide keeper Mary Waldron top-scoring with an unbeaten 33. Isobel Joyce (30), Cecelia Joyce (29) and Gaby Lewis (21) were unable to push on against a South Africa side who had already made sure of qualification, as Lizelle Lee, Sune Luus and Dane van Niekerk all took two wickets. Kim Garth trapped Lee lbw early on in South Africa's reply, but Laura Wolvaardt (32 not out) and Mignon du Preez (29 not out) took them to 82-1 when rain and thunder at the Colombo Cricket Club curtailed the game with the batting side well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system. Shillington, whose ODI career began as a 16-year-old, said: "It feels like it's the right time to move away from the longer format due to the increased programme and upcoming tour commitments. "But I am excited to stay involved in the T20 format with a qualifier and World T20 coming around in 2018." In 2013, she became the first Irish woman to score a Twenty20 hundred in a 117-run victory over Japan, hammering an unbeaten 114 from 72 balls in Dublin, although that match was not classed as a "full" T20 international as Japan do not have T20 international status.

An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from. Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public. Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia. It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify. Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed. The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure".	Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.
The team is processing satellite images to show how rocks in a belt that stretches from Europe's Alps to China are slowly accumulating strain. Movements on the scale of just millimetres per year are being sought. The new maps are being made available to help researchers produce more robust assessments of seismic hazard. The kind of change they are trying to chart is not noticeable in the everyday human sense, but over time will put faults under such pressure that they eventually rupture - often with catastrophic consequences. "We may well discover regions that have very small strain rates that we have not been able to detect before," said Dr Richard Walters. "And that may well tell us that earthquakes are more likely in some areas that traditionally have been thought of as being completely stable and not at risk of having earthquakes at all." Dr Walters is affiliated to the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET). He announced the start of the new service here in San Francisco, at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Key to the UK scientists' work is the high performance of the EU's new Sentinel-1 radar satellites. This pair of spacecraft repeatedly and rapidly image the surface of the globe, throwing their data to the ground using a high-speed laser link. And by comparing whole stacks of their pictures in a technique known as interferometry, the COMET group can begin to see the very slow bending and buckling that occurs in the crust as a result of shifting tectonic plates. To initiate the service, the researchers are concentrating on the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt. This is the sector where most of the deaths arising from big earthquakes occur. In time, however, the mapping exercise will be extended to cover all major seismic hazard zones, including the rim of the Pacific basin - the so-called "ring of fire", where large tremors are also a regular occurrence. To be really effective, the team's maps need to be sensitive to movements of about 1mm per year over 100km. The system is not quite there yet, but as the Sentinels gather more and more images, the desired standard should be realised. As a proof of principle - and to give an example of what the new system can do - the COMET group showed off its maps of Turkey at AGU. These capture the 20-25mm/year westwards march of the Anatolian plateau relative to Eurasia. The focus of interest is how tectonic strain is building up along the North and East Anatolian Faults - the trigger points for so many damaging quakes in the past. Prof Tim Wright, the director of COMET, said one of the breakthroughs that had made the new service possible was simply the prodigious volumes of data the Sentinel satellite system could now feed to the ground. "To give you an example, in just one year of Sentinel operation there are 156 terabytes of data; whereas the entire 10-year archive of Envisat (a previous European radar satellite) has just 24TB. "And we now process the data from the Sentinels automatically within a few hours of getting it." Dr Walters added: "This is a big data project. We've had funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council to build a big data-processing facility, to take these data from the European Space Agency, which they provide for free, and make useful geophysical measurements. "We then serve that to the community. We put the data out there not just for us to analyse and think about seismic hazards, but for scientists all over the world to use." The "Looking inside the Continents from Space" project has just sent live a website where all the processed maps can be accessed. COMET is also working on a very similar system that would allow scientists to track the behaviour of volcanoes. The Sentinels will also see their slow developing bulges of magma that may precede eruptions.

Sheridan only took over as manager at Rodney Parade on Friday after Terry Butcher's departure the previous day. He saw his side fall behind to Exeter when Joel Grant took Jordan Moore-Taylor's cross and cut inside to score. But Newport fought back as John-Lewis pounced after Troy Brown blocked Alex Rodman's initial effort. Newport County manager John Sheridan told BBC Wales Sport: "We played very well, I couldn't have asked any more from the players. "The endeavour and some of the football we played at times was really good. "It's always difficult when you're bottom of the league, you're always looking up at everyone and it was a difficult game against Exeter, I've always liked the way they play. "But the players really responded to the new manager coming in and they gave me a performance I was really pleased with."	New boss John Sheridan saw Newport claim a hard-fought draw in his first game in charge thanks to a Lenell John-Lewis equaliser against Exeter.
Thomas Bebbington, 22, from Shrewsbury, was last seen entering the river near the Dana Steps at about 19:20 GMT on 10 November. A body was found by a member of the public on private land near Leighton, about 10 miles (16.09km) away from the centre of Shrewsbury, on Monday. Mr Bebbington's family has been informed, West Mercia Police confirmed.	Police searching for a man who went missing last month have found a body on the banks of the River Severn.
The vessel's engine failed a mile north east of Muck Island on Thursday evening. Weather conditions at the time were described as good with a Force 3 wind and a slight swell running. A volunteer crew from the Larne RNLI launched two lifeboats at about 18:30 BST. The lifeboat towed the yacht to Carrick Marina. Larne RNLI Deputy Launching Authority Philip Ford-Hutchinson said the call-out was "a great example of both our inshore and all-weather lifeboats working well together to assist the four people onboard the casualty vessel".	Four people have been rescued after their yacht got into difficulty off the County Antrim coast.
Hurst joined Mansfield in June after being released by Southend, and has made 16 appearances for the League Two side this season. The 31-year-old former Sheffield United trainee had not started in a league game since 17 December. He could make his debut for Guiseley when they travel to Wrexham in the National League on Saturday.	National League side Guiseley have signed Mansfield midfielder Kevan Hurst on loan until the end of the season.
A study of more than 250 plants and animals suggests their ability to adapt to changes in rainfall and temperature will be vastly outpaced by future climate change. Amphibians, reptiles and plants are particularly vulnerable, according to US researchers. And tropical species are at higher risk than those in temperate zones. Some animals might be able to move geographically to cope with rising temperatures, but others live in isolated areas where they cannot move, such as in nature reserves or on mountains or islands. Ecologists analysed how quickly species had changed their climatic niches (the conditions where they can survive) over time, and how these rates compared with that of global warming. They analysed 266 populations of plants and animals, including insects, amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles. Rates of change in climatic niches were much slower than rates of projected climate change, by more than 200,000 fold for temperature (on average), they said. "Overall, our results show that rates of climatic niche change among populations of plants and animals are dramatically slower than projected rates of future climate change," said Tereza Jezkova and John Wiens, of the University of Arizona. Mammals and birds might be better placed to survive than amphibians and reptiles, because they had the ability to regulate their own body temperatures, said Dr Wiens. And, while some species might be able to move to higher latitudes or elevations to survive, "for a lot of organisms, that is not an option". "It's a double jeopardy of climate change and habitat destruction," he told BBC News. The research is published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Follow Helen on Twitter.	Many species will not be able to adapt fast enough to survive climate change, say scientists.
The Scottish distance runner already had a certain inner steel and now likens herself to Arnold Schwarzenegger's iconic cyborg creation after acquiring a bit more in the aftermath of a broken ankle in January 2015. "I already had five screws in my left foot and now I have another two and a metal plate in my ankle," the 25-year-old from Dundee explained. "It is almost like a robot foot - I am slowly turning into The Terminator. "I don't set off airport scanners yet, but it is certainly getting that way. It is just really unfortunate that it has always been my left foot." A top-two finish in Sunday's 5,000m at the British Championships, doubling as Olympic trials, would secure a place in the Great Britain team heading to Rio - a fitting reward for persistence in the face of adversity. As McColgan relates the "long process" of recovery from the initial ankle break, to further surgery last July, to jogging again, to issues with "compensatory injuries" and additional nerve problems, it is not hard to understand her surprise at the form she takes to Birmingham. The Scottish 3,000m steeplechase record holder has ditched the hurdles and water jumps to protect her vulnerable ankle and run personal bests in the 3,000m and 5,000m - the latter in her first track outing for 22 months - to achieve the Olympic qualifying standard. "It has been an absolute blessing to come back as quickly as I have," she told BBC 5 live's Sports Panel recently. "I honestly thought this year would be just about slowly building things up and just being happy to be running again. "But my form has come back quite quickly. I put a lot of work in on the cross-trainer and in the gym and pool. I did everything I could apart from running. "It is nice to be back running PBs over all distances and I am ready to race the trials now." Steve Cram, BBC Sport's athletics commentator, saw first hand what McColgan went through at a winter training camp for some of Britain's distance athletes in early February. "I have got a lot of time for Eilish," Cram told BBC Scotland. "I was with her in Kenya and she was still struggling then. "But she never gives up on it. Everyone else was going out and doing their miles on the trails and Eilish was not able to run much at that point, but she was going into the gym and running on the machines. "She threw herself into that rehab with an incredible amount of energy. Her motivation stayed high and that is why she has come out the other end of it. "We have got three or four girls who are doing well at the 5K this year, but if Eilish can re-produce her form at the trials, hopefully she will be in Rio." Fellow Scottish 5,000m runners Steph Twell (14:59.00) and Laura Whittle (15:08.58) have both run faster this year than the 15:09.94 McColgan posted in California in early May. But, given her rapid progress since returning to the track, you wouldn't bet against her, even if she admits the reward of an Olympics spot brings added pressures. "Preparing to put on a GB vest is completely different for me to competing in a Diamond League or a smaller race," she explained. "The Olympics is the pinnacle of sport, it is what you spend years training for and dreaming of. "It is definitely a lot more intense and there are a lot more nerves on the start line knowing the opportunity to make the team is up for grabs. "It is like another level of competition up, but it is one you have prepared for. "You are still running and racing and doing exactly what you have trained to do. But the whole environment is a little bit more pressurised." McColgan has already competed at an Olympics, missing out on the final of the 3,000m steeplechase in London four years ago. She concedes switching to the 5,000m so close to Rio is "quite a scary change"- particularly in such a competitive event. But, considering the alternative, the risk-reward decision became clear. "I can run and get through the aches and pains of my ankle, but the impact of jumping in the steeplechase is just too much of a risk," she said. "It is my favourite event, but if it meant I had to sit on the sidelines for another year, I think mentally it would have been very, very difficult. "I just love running and it would have been silly to risk it to try to make the team for Rio. I just wouldn't be confident mentally." If McColgan requires any further inspiration on the road to Rio, she only has to look at her coach, and mother, Liz McColgan-Nuttall. The 1991 world 10,000m champion, two-time Commonwealth gold medallist and London Marathon winner, who also won Olympics silver, was famous for her belligerence and grit. "My mum is a huge inspiration to me," says her daughter. "So many people come up to me and say 'I used to watch your mum running 25 years ago, it is amazing to see you doing it'. "She is still inspiring people today. It is really nice to hear that about someone who's not just your coach but your mum. "There is something very different about her persona. She is very motivated and hard-driven. She was just so dedicated to what she did. "It is a mentality thing. She has got a fighting mentality and that is what makes people legends in their sport - they have a different mentality to other people. "You don't know why that is or how it has happened, but there is something unique about them." And possibly their offspring too. Bringing home precious metal from Rio would be a huge stretch for McColgan or any of the Brits in a women's event dominated by the leading Ethiopians and Kenyans. But just getting there at all would be cause enough for celebration.	'I'll be back' could have been Eilish McColgan's personal mantra over the past 18 months - even when the doubts and demoralising setbacks continued to afflict her.
The 25-year-old joined the Blues from Reading in August 2015 but has yet to make his debut for the Premier League champions. He was loaned back to the Royals in 2015-16 before spending last season with German side Eintracht Frankfurt.

Girlguiding UK found they needed a new vow that includes non-religious members and those who follow other faiths. It has been replaced with a new promise to "be true to myself and develop my beliefs". The new oath drops the reference to God for the first time since Guides began in 1910. Brownies and Guides currently vow to "to love my God, to serve my Queen and my country". I promise that I will do my best To be true to myself and develop my beliefs To serve the Queen and my community To help other people and To keep the Guide (Brownie) law The consultation about the vow was carried out earlier this year and involved nearly 44,000 Girlguiding UK members and non-members. Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: "Guiding believes in having one promise that is a clear statement of our core values for all our members to commit to. We hope that our new promise will allow all girls - of all faiths and none - to understand and feel proud of their commitment."	From September, girls joining the Brownies and Guides in the UK, will no longer have to pledge their devotion to God.
The 28-year-old Frenchwoman, ranked seventh in the world, said she was taking the decision with immediate effect because of persistent injuries. She made the tearful announcement at a media conference following defeat by Simona Halep at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. "It's time for me to retire and to call it a career," she told reporters. "I feel it's time for me to walk away." Bartoli, who beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki in the Wimbledon final in July, said her Achilles, shoulder, hip and lower back hurt continually when she plays. She added: "It's never easy, but that was actually the last match of my career. I just can't do it anymore." After her 6-1 6-4 win at Wimbledon, Bartoli hinted that the physical demands of the sport were taking their toll. "That was probably the last little bit of something that was left inside me," she said on Wednesday. The 2007 Wimbledon runner-up had won her first Grand Slam at the 47th attempt - the longest wait in women's tennis before a maiden Grand Slam. She had returned from her Wimbledon triumph to play in Toronto last week and was playing her first match in Cincinnati having received a first-round bye. "Sometimes your body just basically says 'that's it, I've had enough'. "I was fortunate enough to retire on my timetable but many athletes can't, they retire when their body gives out and it sounds to me like she was in constant pain everywhere. "It wasn't like it was the knee, or the hip or the shoulder it was like the whole body said 'I'm out of here'. "Once you are in pain, I had bad knees for a few years, it takes all the fun out of playing because every step you take is painful. However, the 3-6 6-4 6-1 loss to Halep appears to have been the last straw. "It's been a tough decision to take," she added. "I've been a tennis player for a long time and I had the chance to make my biggest dream a reality. "You know, everyone will remember my Wimbledon title. No-one will remember the last match I played here. "I made my dream a reality and it will stay forever with me, but now my body just can't cope with everything." WTA chairman and chief executive Stacey Allaster paid tribute to Bartoli's "long, successful career". "She is an inspirational champion and a great ambassador for women's tennis who has dedicated her life to the sport and given so much back to the game," she said. "I am so proud of her for who she is, her values and for fighting to realise her dream of winning Wimbledon."	Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli is retiring from tennis just 40 days after winning her only Grand Slam title.
City were cruising when Fernandinho followed up David Silva's opener with a fine curling shot. George Boyd scored straight after the break, turning home Danny Ings' shot while in an offside position. Media playback is not supported on this device Then Ashley Barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw. It was a result that didn't seem likely at the break, when, despite being without Yaya Toure, Manuel Pellegrini's side looked sure to cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League to a single point and a club record 10th successive win. Samir Nasri's precise pass had been perfect for Jesus Navas to run on to. Silva had found enough space to collect his fellow countryman's cross. He spun round and beat Burnley keeper Tom Heaton by his left-hand post from eight yards for his fourth goal in three games. Nasri then showed admirable patience in waiting for an opening before eventually rolling a pass back to Fernandinho, whose superb curling shot provided him with his first goal of the season when it crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

Fernando was shown a yellow card for fouling Scott Arfield, a booking that will rule him out of the New Year's Day encounter with Sunderland, and Pablo Zabaleta needed a bandage applying to a wound sustained in a clash of heads with Eliaquim Mangala. It took a slice of good fortune for Burnley to get back into the game at the start of the second period, with none of the officials spotting Boyd was in an offside position when he got the slightest of touches to Ings' shot before it squeezed under Joe Hart. Both sides had chances after that. Heaton denied Nasri with a full-length save and, at the other end, Ings was narrowly wide with a shot from 25 yards before Arfield was denied by a well-timed tackle from Martin Demichelis. Burnley kept going and their attacking intent was rewarded when a long free-kick bounced off Michael Keane and Barnes wasted no time in driving a first-time shot in to the roof of Hart's net before the City keeper had a chance to react. Rather than risk losing their point, the visitors, who have not won an away game in the league against City since 1963, opted for a safety-first strategy at the end, with manager Sean Dyche telling his players to take the ball towards the corner flag during five minutes of injury time. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "It is a big opportunity to get two more points. "At half-time everybody would think the game was over but I always say it is never over until the last minute. Burnley's first goal was a mistake by the referee but once it goes to 2-2 we didn't have the legs to score. "We were at home. That is an advantage but Chelsea and Manchester United also drew." Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "At half-time I thought we were performing well. The key was getting that first goal so early. "I believe in the physicality of my players. Last season we would have played seven more games than this so I am not worried about fatigue. "But it is only a point. It might be Manchester City and we might have been 2-0 down, but it is still only a point."	Manchester City missed a golden chance to close the gap on league leaders Chelsea as they surrendered a two-goal half-time lead against Burnley.
Michael Tovey, 27, formerly of Lakes Road, Erdington, Birmingham is accused of using two drones to fly contraband into HMP Birmingham last year. In the first charges of their type brought by West Midlands Police, Mr Tovey faces 13 counts of conveying banned items into a prison. He is set to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 7 June. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Tovey is accused of using two drones to drop contraband into the prison's exercise yard on 29 October and 6 November. He attempted to drop a consignment near N and P wings containing four phones, SIM cards, Black Mamba, steroids and cannabis, it is alleged. It is claimed he was also responsible for a drone that crashed into the same yard eight days later, carrying two phones and further quantities of the same banned drugs.	A man has been charged with using drones to smuggle cannabis, steroids and mobile phones into prison.
Lee Novak put the Spireites ahead, nodding in Gboly Ariyibi's cross, for his 14th goal of the season before Adam Hammill's deflected equaliser. Jamal Campbell-Ryce was dismissed for two yellow cards, one for kicking the ball away, but Ollie Banks side-footed home to restore Chesterfield's lead. Hamill then hit the post as Barnsley could not find a late leveller. Defeat in their first league game since winning the Johnstone's Paint Trophy means Barnsley are now six points off the League One play-off positions. Chesterfield, meanwhile, have now opened up a four-point gap between themselves and the relegation places.	Ten-man Chesterfield edged out Barnsley to boost their own survival chances and dent their hosts' play-off ambitions.
As reported in the Daventry Express, Sam Chambers, coach of Weedon Bec Primary School, sent his CV to the FA after England crashed out of Euro 2016. "I feel like the perfect candidate as I have guided my school... to an unbeaten 2015-16 season," he wrote. Ladbrokes has made him a 1,000/1 outsider for the job. Roy Hodgson stood down as England manager after the shock 2-1 defeat to Iceland last week. Jessica Bridge from the bookmaker said: "Stranger things have happened in the last 12 months, like Leicester City winning the Premier League, so it's not out of the realms of possibility. "Sam enters the record books as one of the greatest sporting underdogs of all time." Mr Chambers, who describes himself as a "sports enthusiast", faces stiff competition from current favourites Jurgen Klinsmann and Sam Allardyce, but says he has the passion to be a success in the job. "I, along with millions across the nation, saw our beloved team fall to the minnows that are Iceland," he wrote in his covering letter to the FA. "It is my intention, should I be given the opportunity, to re-kindle the enthusiasm of the nation for the round-ball game." Elaborating on his school's impressive season, Mr Chambers added he had guided his side to an unbeaten campaign - even though they faced "mighty teams such as Woodford Halse CE Primary Academy". He ends the letter with an optimistic "I look forward to hearing from you all!" The FA is yet to comment on Mr Chambers' application. Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy failed in his quest to become Inverness Caledonian Thistle's new manager, despite a pledge that his headmaster would probably let him leave school early "for important matches and training".	The coach of a primary school football team has applied for the England job, saying he is the "perfect candidate" to succeed Roy Hodgson.
Bendtner required oxygen as he was carried off the field on a stretcher, having landed awkwardly in a collision with Blues defender Michael Morrison. The Dane had set up Eric Lichaj to open the scoring and Apostolos Vellios made it 2-0 from Henri Lansbury's cross. Lukas Jutkiewicz headed a goal back for Blues but Hildeberto Pereira finished Ben Osborn's low pass to seal victory. A Birmingham win could have taken Gary Rowett's side as high as second in the table, but their first away loss of the league campaign means they may be outside the top six by the time they host Rotherham on Tuesday. Lichaj's powerful angled shot, the defender's first goal for almost a year, lit up a flat first half at the City Ground. The only other talking point before the interval was Lansbury's disallowed free-kick, with referee Jeremy Simpson initially awarding a goal and then reversing his decision following consultation with his assistant. Forest's win came hours after owner Fawaz Al Hasawi announced he is close to agreeing a deal to sell the club. Al Hasawi, who took control of Forest in 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers but BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a £50m deal. Head coach Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I enjoyed the victory. We've worked hard during the international break and we applied what we worked on during that period. "Bendtner's injury is a bad point of this evening. We don't know how serious it is. I hope it is not very serious. "When you go off on a stretcher, you always worry. We hope to have more news on Saturday." Birmingham manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM: "We weren't anywhere near the standards we've set so far this season, certainly in the first half. We were a little bit too predictable. "We wanted to do much better in the second half and there was a real determination to do that. We ended up at 2-1 and we looked as though we had put them under some real pressure. "I wasn't overly happy with one or two decisions, but I thought Forest deserved it. They showed more energy and desire." Match ends, Nottingham Forest 3, Birmingham City 1. Second Half ends, Nottingham Forest 3, Birmingham City 1.

The evolutionary scientist, whose books include The God Delusion, said Wales was "ahead of the rest of the UK" in showing a decline in religious belief. The census found 32% in Wales have no religion, against a UK figure of 25%. The Church in Wales said Christianity was "no longer the default setting" for many, but the picture was complex. Of those in Wales who described themselves as believers, the number of Christians fell by 14 percentage points to 57%. Prof Dawkins said: "I congratulate the people of Wales in coming out ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom in this respect - well done." He told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales that he believed in the "wonder" of scientific truth. He said: "People who are educated in religion are positively encouraged not to investigate, not to think sceptically about why they are here, but instead to accept what people wrote 2,000 years ago. "I guess we do need focal points for communities but you can say also that religion has been a focal point for all sorts of backward, indeed bigoted, thinking about homosexuality, about abortion, the right to die, that we're seeing at the moment." He added that research commissioned by his foundation meant that the outlook for Christianity in the UK was "even more pessimistic" than the census data suggested. He said many of those who put themselves down at Christian did so because they thought of themselves "as a good person" rather than due to belief in the virgin birth, or of Jesus Christ as the son of God. Prof Dawkins dismissed the figures for people saying they were a Jedi knight or that heavy metal music was their religion as "a kind of protest" against the inclusion of a census question on religion. The census found those in Wales who are Muslim was 1.5%, up from 0.7% in 2001, while there were also slight increases Hindus or Buddhists, both up from 0.2% to 0.3%. There was also a rise in people saying they had other faiths, from 0.2% to 0.4% while the percentage who said they were Sikh or Jewish remained unchanged between 2001 and 2011 at 0.1%. Churches said they were not discouraged by the findings, and argued that Christian belief was still clearly alive and well. Following the census results, the Church in Wales said: "It should also be borne in mind that statistics can't show the whole picture in matters of faith. "The past few months, for example, have seen people in different parts of Wales turn to churches in their thousands following various tragic events: in Machynlleth, in Ely, in St Asaph. "People find God when life gets tough and it is the church's privilege to be there for them whenever and wherever we may be needed."	Atheist author Prof Richard Dawkins has congratulated the people of Wales after nearly a third of them revealed in the 2011 census that they have no religion.
The crash, which happened at the Rising Sun in North Bradley near Trowbridge at about 06:00 GMT, left a huge hole in the front of the building. Wiltshire Police said the driver was taken to Bath's Royal United Hospital for treatment to his injuries, which are not thought to be serious. Nobody was inside at the time of the crash, officers said. The building has been deemed to be structurally safe. The road next to the pub was closed for several hours but has since reopened.	A lorry driver has smashed through the front wall of a pub in Wiltshire.
Edinburgh will also provide the venue for the European Challenge Cup the same year, but the host stadium has yet to be chosen for that event. European Professional Club Rugby announced the decision in Geneva ahead of next season's competition draws. France will host the 2016 finals, with both being played at the new Grand Stade de Lyon over one weekend. The Edinburgh finals will also take place over the same weekend. Scottish Rugby director of commercial operations, communications and public affairs Dominic McKay said: "It is a real endorsement of the work Scottish Rugby and its partners have achieved and will create a fantastic sporting weekend in Edinburgh and bring fans to the city from across Europe. "We have a great track record of putting on world-class events, including the highly successful hosting of the previous European Cup finals in 2005 and 2009 at BT Murrayfield, and this award will give us a further chance to showcase the passion for rugby and international sport here in Scotland." The Scottish Government and Event Scotland assisted the Edinburgh bid and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "After what has been quite a successful season for rugby in Scotland with Glasgow being crowned Pro12 champions and Edinburgh reaching the final of the European Challenge Cup, this announcement will keep the feel-good factor in the game going." Clubs finishing highest in the Celtic, English and French leagues qualify for the Champions Cup, while the others take part in the Challenge Cup. Edinburgh were beaten by Gloucester in last season's Challenge Cup final, hosted by Harlequins at the Stoop, while Twickenham was the venue for the Champions Cup final in which Toulon defeated French rivals Clermont Auvergne. Next season's Challenge Cup final will be played in Lyon on Friday 13 May, while the final of the Champions Cup will take place the next day. European Rugby said it had chosen the 2017 host city now to give organisers greater preparation time. President Simon Halliday said: "We received an extremely interesting also from the Scottish Rugby and we wanted to recognise choosing the renowned city of Edinburgh for the finals of 2017." The news was welcomed by Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend. "It's more than just a one-off game now with the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup played in the same city on the same weekend," he said. "With the quality of players in both tournaments, it's the highest level of club rugby, certainly in Europe if not in the world, so it'll be one of those must-see events. "It's great for Scottish rugby that it's going to take place in Edinburgh."	Murrayfield Stadium has been chosen to host the 2017 European Champions Cup final in May of that year.
With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. "When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!'," reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. "And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. "There are some big fights out there for me," said Burns. "I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. "That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. "I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?" Hearn said suitors could "make all the offers they want, we'll listen". "If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well." At that point Burns quipped: "I'd be one of them." The lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.	In a sport beset by tiresome braggadocio, Ricky Burns seems like an impostor.
Police said the 14-year-old reported feeling unwell and required hospital treatment. He was later discharged from hospital and is recovering at home. The incident happened in Holywood, County Down, on Saturday. The PSNI said the tablets were "as yet unidentified" but warned of the "potential dangers" they posed. The 17-year-old, has been charged with possessing a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply; possessing a Class B controlled drug with intent to supply; possession of a Class A controlled drug; possession of a Class B controlled drug and supplying a Class A controlled drug. He is due to appear at Newtownards Youth Court on 14 February.	A 17-year-old boy has been charged with drugs offences after a 14-year-old boy was treated in hospital after taking half of a 'Darth Vader' tablet.
To take just a single example, one person on Twitter said of The Times's front page: "He's white, so let's highlight the fact that he's jobless, a lone wolf and suffered mental health issues." The Times certainly wasn't alone in receiving such opprobrium. On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail devoted an entire page to an editorial taking umbrage, to put it mildly, with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the attacker at Finsbury Park mosque may have been indoctrinated by reading that paper and The Sun. I tweeted about that battle here. But the issue that most interests me is that Facebook and Google have been getting it in the neck for not doing more to remove far-right material online glorifying the attack. In recent months, political pressure has mounted on these two tech giants, as well as other smaller firms, to ensure that the internet is not a "safe space" for terrorists. That old political instinct that Something Must Be Done has kicked into overdrive. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron committed not only to working together on this issue, but introducing fines if companies didn't act faster to remove hateful material. It is interesting that this political pressure has been re-applied in the light of an attack by a white man on Muslims. It suggests that the scope of material on the web that could meet with popular disapproval is vast. Will an anti-Semitic attack prompt demands that Facebook and Google act on anti-Semitism? Could a rise in sectarian hatred in India prompt demands in that country for, say, Hindu nationalist content to be removed? Perhaps so. Which means this is a good time to remind you of the complexity of this issue and why, though I certainly don't instinctively take the side of the most powerful companies in the world, it's important to be clear about the implications of turning our Something Must Be Done ire against them. First of all, we have to separate the issue of encryption from the broader one about hateful content. At times, leading British politicians haven't seemed to grasp the difference. Messaging apps like WhatsApp are attractive to terrorists because they are protected at both ends: security services can't easily infiltrate them. But if you undermine that protection by creating a so-called back door to encryption, that is an invitation to all sorts of nasties - from foreign powers to cyber-criminals - to take advantage. On the issue of what to do about hateful material, the problems with clamping down on it are several, and both practical and philosophical. Practically speaking, the sheer volume of content is impossible to manage, probably even with Artificial Intelligence. Some 350 million photos are posted on Facebook every day, and 400 hours of video uploaded on YouTube every minute. Moreover, internet content appears in multiple jurisdictions. If my mate in Jamaica is a fascist, and uploads a violent video from his veranda in Kingston Town saying all non-Rastafarians must die, with a specific threat attached, some people might say that is a matter for the Jamaican authorities. But if I download it and share it among my school mates in Tooting, London is it a matter for UK authorities too? Internet companies are also to a large extent protected by the Communications Decency Act, an American law from 1996 which says social media users rather than platforms are responsible for content. This legislation was designed to protect freedom of information. Companies like Google say they are doing lots to tackle extremism. See Kent Walker's piece earlier this week in the Financial Times for instance. As I've written before, Silicon Valley companies are terrified of legislation and have a mindset that promotes technological over regulatory solutions to social problems. In this, they differ from many Europeans. And this points to a philosophical problem about asking the likes of Google and Facebook to police the internet more closely. Do we really want private companies - who have what critics argue is a global monopoly - to censor ever more of our lives? Having completely reinvented our public domain in a very, very short space of time, asking tech giants to now do more to tackle extremism, whether Muslim, anti-Muslim or whatever, gives them a social role we may not like the implications of when we think about it. Of course, with their immense power must come immense responsibility - from paying taxes properly to submitting themselves to greater public scrutiny (something they far too often run scared of). But for the practical and philosophical reasons I outline, responding to the political imperative for something to be done on hateful online content is as complicated as it is vital.	The attack on Muslims at Finsbury Park mosque has prompted a debate about whether the media has inherent biases, and caused a major kerfuffle within Britain's newspapers.
Officials from Staffordshire County Council and the university said the historic building, in the town centre, would become an information centre for prospective students. A number of courses will also be taught there. The courtroom and an art gallery housed in the Grade II-listed building will remain open to the public. Campaigners drew up a petition after the council announced it was considering closing the exhibition space to save money.	Stafford Shire Hall is to become an outpost of the University of Wolverhampton.

Finally, after all the hype and excitement, consumers are about to  get their hands on virtual reality headsets - and we will find out whether there really is a market for this technology. Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive are both released in the next few weeks, and at the Games Developer Conference in San Francisco Sony unveiled its launch date and price. While Playstation owners will have to wait until October to get their hands on the Sony VR headset, they will pay far less for it than for a Vive or Oculus setup. With nearly 40 million PS4 owners around the world, there's a ready-made market for Sony's offering, so by Christmas it's a fair bet that it will be the leader in VR. Mind you, while there is now a huge amount of experimentation around VR and 360 degree video (see last week's BBC Click for example) there is still confusion about how it will be used beyond gaming. At a launch event for Nokia's Ozo 360 camera last night, I was shown a number of demos filmed with the device. I stood next to the vocalist as a band performed, watched as a bear approached a group of nervous people at a campsite, and saw trainee astronauts learning about weightlessness in a swimming pool. The VR headset meant I could choose my own perspective on each scene, but once the novelty wore off the question remained - what is this for? Still, music producers, moviemakers and educationalists are all now producing 360 and VR material, so hopefully they will find an answer to my question. At the end of a week where Google's AI program AlphaGo defeated a champion Go player, the artificial intelligence community is discussing what this triumph of machine over man means. I visited Microsoft's UK research lab in Cambridge where a number of artificial intelligence projects are under way , including one experiment using AI in the game Minecraft and another where a program examines scans of brain tumours. The man who runs the lab, Chris Bishop, says it's wrong to paint a dystopian future in which machines gradually replace us as they get ever smarter. Instead he sees AI as a collaboration between humans and computers - for instance doctors using the brain tumour scanning program to assist their diagnoses rather than replacing them. "We need to talk instead about a partnership in which machine intelligence and human intelligence work together," he says. "It's the case today, and will be the case for some time to come that the capabilities of machines, the capabilities of humans are different and complementary and if they work together they will be stronger than either of them alone." Incidentally, for a different view, have a look at this piece from Tom Chatfield in the Guardian. He argues that in designing AI systems, we humans are making too many concessions to inflexible computers. Back to gaming and we look at the boom in a phenomenon which is familiar to anyone under 25 but a mystery to the older generation - watching video games online. The big player in the live streaming of video games is Twitch, which was bought by Amazon 18 months ago. But we hear from a rival, Ian Sharpe, who says his Azubu streaming service has a different approach. While Twitch lets anyone become a broadcaster, playing anything from Call of Duty to Minecraft, Azubu is more focused on professional eSports. Last  week it signed a deal with the Electronic Sports League to stream exclusive content from esports tournaments - and Ian Sharpe tells us that this is going to be a new boom area for media firms looking to reach those elusive "millennials" who don't watch boring old telly. Tune in to Tech Tent on the BBC World Service at 15:00 GMT for all that and more or catch the podcast later.	On this week's edition of Tech Tent we look at two visions of the future of gaming, and we ask whether we should be worried or excited by the latest advances in artificial intelligence.
Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: "We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters." We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. Media playback is not supported on this device Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. Media playback is not supported on this device Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny: I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny: He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny: I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.	We've all done it.
The Seagulls remain one point ahead of second-placed Newcastle. Tommy Smith's angled shot put the hosts in front before Tomer Hemed rounded the goalkeeper to equalise. Nahki Wells fired into the top corner and Elias Kachunga nodded in to make it 3-1 before half-time, and Lewis Dunk's red card added to Brighton's misery. Centre-back Dunk was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half for a lunging challenge on Izzy Brown, having been booked in the first period for a foul on the same player. The Terriers' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Leeds, who they play at home on Sunday. Brighton, knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln five days earlier, were uncharacteristically poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months. The outstanding Rajiv van La Parra had already hit the post before full-back Smith's attempted cross landed back at his feet, and his subsequent shot flew in at the near post. Hemed pounced on a poor back header from Huddersfield's Aaron Mooy to level, but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes. Wells' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in English football, and it was the former Bradford forward's shot which goalkeeper David Stockdale palmed into the air for Kachunga to head in Huddersfield's third from close range. After Dunk's dismissal, the fifth of his career, there was still time for Australian midfielder Mooy to strike the upright from long range and Stockdale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute Kasey Palmer. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: "It was a good one, maybe one of the best this season. We scored three goals and had chances for more, and conceded a sloppy goal which was easy to avoid, but it was very good. "We are fresh and still very hungry and greedy, even when we are humble and we know we're playing against the best team in the division. "We gave ourselves no limits, we try our best and today our best was very good." Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: "Every now and again you get a real bad one, and that was a real bad one. "We were nowhere near the levels you need to play any game in this division, never mind one as good as Huddersfield, and on their own ground too. "If we put in another performance like this at Brentford on Sunday, we will lose again. We need to be far better. "Lewis Dunk has played the ball but he was already on a yellow and he's given the referee a decision to make. It's another one for him and something he has to learn from. We are going to miss him. It's a blow." Match ends, Huddersfield Town 3, Brighton and Hove Albion 1. Second Half ends, Huddersfield Town 3, Brighton and Hove Albion 1. Attempt saved.

It said in a report that cuts had not been applied equally since 2010, with local authorities in the poorest areas seeing the biggest reductions. The MPs warned further cuts could undermine councils' financial stability and threaten statutory services. Local authority funding has been cut as part of efforts to tackle the deficit. Most local authority funding in England comes from central government, with about a quarter of it raised through council tax. Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office has said that by 2016 local authority funding will have been cut in real terms by 37% since 2010. In a report on the financial sustainability of local authorities, the Public Accounts Committee said that while local authorities had responded well to cuts "on the whole", there were concerns over whether some councils would continue to be financially sustainable. "This is particularly the case for authorities responsible for adult social care and children's services," it said. Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: "These cuts have not hit all local authorities equally, with reductions ranging between 5% and 40%. "Councils with the greatest spending needs - the most deprived authorities - have been receiving the largest reductions." The report said the Department for Communities and Local Government - which has overall responsibility for council funding - did not fully understand the impact of funding cuts. It said the department relied too much on spending data and had insufficient information on service levels, service quality and the financial sustainability of councils. "Without at least an idea of the amount of funding required to maintain statutory services to a minimum standard, it is hard to see how the department could ensure that local authorities are able to fulfil their statutory duties," Mrs Hodge said. The report also questioned whether the department was providing effective enough leadership to ensure councils could change the way they deliver their services to absorb future cuts and remain financially sustainable. "Overall, as pressure from cuts grows, so do the risks to local authorities' finances and their provision of services. "The depth and quality of the department's insight into these issues needs to keep pace with these changes, something it has struggled so far to achieve," the report said. In December, ministers outlined an average funding cut of 1.8% in English councils' overall spending power, as part of the local government finance settlement for 2015-16. Some councils will face cuts of up to 6.4% - which local authority bosses said would "push some authorities to breaking point". The government says the funding grants settlement was "fair for all parts of the country". Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said at the time that the settlement still left councillors with "considerable total spending power", and that many councils were seeing growth in income from business rates.	Councils in the most deprived areas of England have been hardest hit by cuts to their funding, the Public Accounts Committee has said.
Lithuania violated an article on free elections in the European Convention on Human Rights, the ruling said. Mr Paksas was impeached and removed from office as president after the Baltic state's constitutional court found that he had abused his position. He is now a Euro MP in Strasbourg. The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday is binding, meaning that Lithuania, an EU member state, will have to act on it to prevent any similar violation in future. But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying their ruling was in itself "sufficient just satisfaction". Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One (Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2004 Mr Paksas became the first European head of state in modern times to be impeached and removed from office. The former Soviet republic's constitutional court found that he had illegally arranged Lithuanian citizenship for a Russian-born businessman, Yuri Borisov. But Mr Paksas, an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times, was cleared of the charge of having leaked state secrets to Russia. After the constitutional court had backed Mr Paksas's disqualification, the Lithuanian parliament adopted a new electoral rule barring anyone from becoming an MP if they had previously been dismissed in impeachment proceedings. Mr Paksas complained that the rule had been passed deliberately to bar him from office. He also said the constitutional court had lacked impartiality and had exceeded its powers. The Strasbourg judges accepted that a breach of the constitution was "a particularly serious matter", but they argued that Mr Paksas's permanent and irreversible disqualification from running for election was disproportionate. In 2009 Mr Paksas was elected to the European Parliament. He sits with the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which seeks to defend national sovereignty and prevent the further concentration of power in Brussels.	The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Lithuania was wrong to bar former President Rolandas Paksas from running for parliament after he had been ousted from power in 2004.
Ex-Libyan dissident Abdul Hakim Belhaj says MI6 helped to arrange his and his wife's rendition - saying they were covertly taken from Thailand to Libya. The case, involving allegations against ex-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and an ex-MI6 chief, prompted an unprecedented battle over whether it can even begin. The Supreme Court is to decide whether the couple can sue the UK government. Police have investigated the claims but the Crown Prosecution Service is yet to announce its charging decision. The so-called extraordinary rendition programme operated for years in the wake of the 9/11 attacks of the US. The claims involve the secret detention and transfer of terror suspects between countries for interrogation, allegedly including torture. The UK and rendition allegations Government can be sued over rendition claims Belhaj torture case against UK rejected Mr Belhaj, a former Islamist fighter who opposed the Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, says he was seized by US forces alongside his wife, Fatima Boudchar, in 2004 as they tried to fly from Asia to the UK to seek asylum. The couple were taken from Thailand to Libya - and they were immediately imprisoned. Mrs Boudchar, then pregnant, says she was abused in prison and feared she would lose her baby before she was released three months later. Mr Belhaj has told British courts he was beaten, subjected to other abuses and, separately, interviewed by British intelligence officers. The regime sentenced him to death, but he was eventually released in March 2010. During the later fall of Gaddafi, papers uncovered in Tripoli revealed MI6's former head of counter-terrorism Sir Mark Allen had sent his congratulations to the Libyan regime for the "safe arrival" of Mr Belhaj. "This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built up over recent years," he is said to have written. "The intelligence about [Mr. Belhaj] was British." The couple launched a damages claim against the government, Sir Mark and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw four years ago and have offered to settle for Â£1 and an apology. A High Court judge initially ruled out the claim, saying it could damage foreign relationships - but the Court of Appeal said the "grave" allegations must be examined. The Supreme Court must now decide whether to allow the government's final appeal which is focused on a complex legal principle. Ministers say the case should not proceed because it would breach a long-standing legal doctrine that prevents one state's courts from ruling on whether a foreign government acted unlawfully. The Court of Appeal ruled that while that principle was valid, it could not stop a British court from examining whether British agencies, officials or ministers were separately culpable. The four-day Supreme Court hearing is being heard before seven justices - a sign of how important they regard the issues. They are also looking at a similar case involving a Pakistan man, Yunus Rahmatullah, who says he was tortured by US forces after being handed over to them in Iraq by British forces.	One of the most controversial claims of rendition involving the UK is being heard by the Supreme Court.
After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to "taking an egg out of omelette"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he "wanted to serve" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a "third way" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. "To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision," he said about whether he would extend his stay. "No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. "Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors." Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of "tension" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.	Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.
Roedd Aelod Cynulliad Plaid Cymru dros yr etholaeth, Elin Jones, wedi cyhoeddi llun o'r hysbyseb ar ei thudalen Facebook, gan fynnu nad oedd yn wir. Yn dilyn hynny dywedodd Mark Williams, ymgeisydd y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Ngheredigion, fod yr hysbyseb yn "nonsens" a'i fod bellach wedi ei dileu. Ychwanegodd Mr Williams, arweinydd y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Nghymru, fod ei blaid yn gweithio "gyda phawb sydd yn erbyn Brexit caled, gan gynnwys Plaid Cymru". Yn yr hysbyseb gafodd ei chyhoeddi ar Facebook, dywedodd y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol mai nhw oedd yr unig blaid "sy'n brwydro i gadw Prydain yn y farchnad sengl yn yr etholiad hwn". Roedd yr hysbyseb yn ychwanegu fod "Plaid Cymru'n cefnogi Brexit eithafol ynghyd â Llafur, y Toris ac UKIP". Mae'r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol wedi addo yn ystod ymgyrch yr etholiad cyffredinol eleni y bydden nhw'n cynnal ail refferendwm ar ddiwedd y trafodaethau Brexit, gyda'r opsiwn o aros yn yr UE os nad yw etholwyr yn hapus â'r cytundeb terfynol. Mae Plaid Cymru wedi dweud eu bod nhw'n derbyn canlyniad y refferendwm llynedd, ond y bydden nhw'n brwydro i gael "bargen dda i Gymru". Fe wnaeth Ms Jones gyhoeddi llun o hysbyseb y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol ar ei thudalen Facebook ddydd Llun, gan ddweud bod Plaid Cymru "ddim yn cefnogi Brexit eithafol". "Mae popeth rydyn ni wedi ei ddweud yn yr etholiad yma yn gwneud hynny'n glir. Eto mae'r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yn dweud celwydd a dweud fel arall," meddai. Dywedodd ei bod wedi "disgwyl gwell" gan Mark Williams, gan fynnu ymddiheuriad. Ychwanegodd yn ddiweddarach mewn neges ar Twitter fod pamffledi ymgyrchu gan y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yn yr etholaeth hefyd wedi ailadrodd yr un neges. Ers hynny mae Mr Williams wedi ymddiheuro, gan ddweud mewn neges ar Twitter: "Roedd yr hysbyseb Facebook yn nonsens ac mae wedi cael ei ddileu. "Rydw i'n gwerthfawrogi gweithio gyda phawb sydd yn erbyn Brexit caled, gan gynnwys Plaid Cymru, a dwi'n ymddiheuro iddynt." Mewn cyfarfod hystings yn Aberystwyth nos Lun, mynnodd Mr Williams nad oedd yn gyfrifol am gynnwys yr hysbyseb, a'i fod wedi dod o gyfeiriad y blaid yn ganolog. Ychwanegodd y byddai'n ymchwilio i'r mater i weld pwy oedd yn gyfrifol am y cynnwys. Dywedodd hefyd nad oedd amser gan y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol i anfon taflenni newydd yn ymddiheuro, gydag ond tridiau nes yr etholiad. Roedd rhai o drigolion yr etholaeth wedi derbyn pamffledi oedd yn cynnwys neges debyg, yn honni na fyddai Plaid Cymru'n "brwydro yn erbyn Brexit caled". Mae Mr Williams wedi bod yn AS dros Geredigion ers 2005, ar ôl cipio'r sedd oddi ar Blaid Cymru. Ymgeisydd Plaid Cymru yng Ngheredigion yn yr etholiad cyffredinol eleni yw Ben Lake. Am restr lawn o'r ymgeiswyr cliciwch yma.	Mae ymgeisydd dros y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol wedi ymddiheuro ar ôl i'w blaid gyhoeddi hysbyseb yn awgrymu fod Plaid Cymru yn cefnogi "Brexit eithafol".
She outlined her concerns about the consequences of the Brexit vote in a letter to Theresa May on Wednesday. Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness highlighted five key priorities to the prime minister. On Thursday, Mrs Foster said: "Brexit means Brexit, but that doesn't mean that we close our eyes to the challenges that are there." She emphasised that Northern Ireland's border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity, nor create an incentive for those who wished to undermine the peace process. "In the past, terrorists have used the border as a way of evading justice and that can not be the case in the future," she said. "We need to make sure that we have strong mechanisms in place to make sure that they don't get away with that sort of activity." In their letter, the first and deputy first ministers highlighted to Mrs May  that Northern Ireland was unique as the only part of the UK that has a border with an EU member state. They also referred to costs, the energy market, drawdown of EU funding and treatment of the agri-food sector as other priorities. During the referendum, Mrs Foster's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) campaigned in favour of Brexit, while Martin McGuinness's Sinn FÃ©in wanted to stay in the EU. When it comes to the economy, they said they wanted to "retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states". "It would be negligent of me not to point out where I believe the challenges are," Mrs Foster said. "We're extracting ourselves from European Union and it is of course right that we identify where those challenges lie, but I fundamentally believe that there are huge opportunities." Speaking on Thursday, Mr McGuinness said the letter was "a very important indication" that he and Mrs Foster "recognise our huge responsibility to the people we represent". "I think we would've done a grave disservice if we hadn't articulated the differences and challenges we might face in times ahead," he said. "This is about how we protect the interests of the people we represent and the challenges that lie ahead." He added that it was important the he and the first minister "come together in the aftermath of the vote" in spite of having been on different sides of the referendum debate. "My gripe isn't with Arlene Foster, my gripe is with David Cameron who called the referendum in the first place," he said. "This is too big, too serious for us not to be joined up in relation to how we take this process forward." Stormont's opposition parties criticised the letter, with the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) economy spokesperson Steve Aiken asking "whether this is a DUP u-turn on their position on the referendum". Mrs Foster replied that the UUP's position on Brexit had been "comical". She added: "Poor Steven Aiken has been sent out once again to be the attack dog against the executive, and frankly he comes across more as a Chihuahua." However, the SDLP's Claire Hanna said: "The first minister has serious questions to answer over the breathtaking reverse ferret she is currently performing. "Ms Foster has clearly realised the error of her ways in backing Brexit, and now the horse has bolted is asking the Conservative government to close the gate." While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48%, 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.	First Minister Arlene Foster has denied that campaigning for the UK to leave the EU was a mistake.
Stewart, 26, netted a hat-trick and Hemmings, 24, scored twice as Dundee beat Dumbarton 6-2 on Saturday. The attacking pair were also regular scorers for the Dark Blues last season, Hemmings notching 25 goals, Stewart 11. "They are fantastic players. Hopefully we can keep hold of them for a bit longer," O'Dea, 29, told BBC Scotland. "They are obviously two good pals of mine and it is about getting the right move, it's not moving for the sake of it. "If you go to England you will probably earn more money but the two of them can really progress and go on to a very high level in the game. It's important if they did move, it's the right move. "To replace them, it's virtually impossible, because you don't have the money to go and replace them." Former Rangers youth player Hemmings and Stewart played together at Cowdenbeath and have scored almost 60 goals between them for Paul Hartley's side in the last two seasons. "You need to have recruitment, which Dundee do have, and you need to have an eye for a player, which our manager does have," added Republic of Ireland cap O'Dea, who headed Dundee's other goal against Dumbarton. "These two lads came from lower league clubs. Credit to the manager, he's found talent in lower leagues, which there is an abundance of. "But to actually go and replace them straightaway is virtually impossible." Rangers, Aberdeen and Leeds United are among the clubs rumoured to be keen on prising Stewart away from Dens Park. "There's going to be interest in Greg the way he's performed over the last two years," said manager Hartley after what he called a "sublime" performance from the attacking midfielder on Saturday. "But we don't want to sell him. There's no way we could replace him - no danger about that."	Dundee defender Darren O'Dea believes team-mates Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart would be "virtually impossible" to replace in the short term.
Sharad Bheswakar, top cricketer and sporting icon in Nepal, is not actually a Nepali. At least officially, he is not a citizen of the country he calls home. He was born and raised in Nepal and plays for the national team. He has an Indian father and a Nepali mother, so getting citizenship should not be a problem according to the law of the land. But his efforts to acquire Nepalese citizenship so far have been futile. "It's been almost eight to nine years that I've been trying to get my citizenship. I'm still facing problems. It's really frustrating at times," he says. A few years ago, he was given a travel document as a special concession so he could play in matches abroad. Bridging India's identity divide A life without identity Identity in pictures A game changer? Pakistan's identity management In Nepal, you can usually apply for citizenship at the age of 16 as long as your father or mother is able to sign the official document, according to the Nepali Citizenship Act of 2006. But in practice, women in this patriarchal society still face a lot of discrimination when passing down citizenship to their children, specially in the absence of the father or if the father is not a Nepali citizen. A lack of citizenship document can make your life tough - you cannot get a driving licence, open a bank account, pursue higher education or carry out legal transactions. And according to the United Nations, the number of people grappling with this problem is far from small. "We estimate from the numbers we've seen that this is quite a big problem," says Robert Piper, the UN Resident Humanitarian Co-ordinator. "In the Election Commission's findings, more than 2 million people they interviewed - people just from the villages, not the urban areas - were actually unable to show their citizenship documents," adds Mr Piper. Usha Kala Rai, a member of the now dissolved Constituent Assembly, believes that Nepal's bureaucratic system discriminates against women. "Many women are victims of violence and discrimination. Specially those who have gone abroad for work, victims of rape, women who were abandoned, those forced to leave home and divorcees - all risk being deprived of their identity," she says. Bhagwati Chettri, 55, a Nepali, was abandoned by her husband several years ago. She does not have her own citizenship document because she failed to acquire one from either her parents or her husband before he left her. This means that her two children, who are just coming of age, have no legal identity either. "I have been trying for the last eight years to get a citizenship certificate. These days even to rent an apartment, you need it. I am getting old, so I won't need it much. But what about my children? If they could at least get the document, they could earn a living." With Nepal currently in the midst of discussions about the future political set-up in the country, the issue of citizenship is highly sensitive. Nepali politicians feel they have to be strict about the requirements for citizenship, surrounded as they are on three sides by a large and very populous neighbour - India. Nepal is now considering a proposed law which makes it obligatory for both parents to be Nepali citizens in order to hand it down to their children. The UN's Robert Piper describes this as "very narrow and conservative by international standards". If this draft law is accepted, hundreds of thousands of children, the product of inter-marriages between Nepalis and foreigners, specially Indians in the southern parts of the country, will remain non-persons in Nepal.	The issue of identity is a sensitive and controversial one in Nepal, a country in flux as the drafting of a new constitution fails and new elections are announced, reports John Narayan Parajuli from Kathmandu.
The #BringBackOurGirls group should be ashamed of manipulating "the victims of terrorism", he said. Mr Jonathan had been due to hold his first meeting with some of the girls' parents on Tuesday. Islamist group Boko Haram captured more than 200 girls during a raid on their boarding school in Chibok in April. Mr Jonathan had been widely criticised for failing to meet distraught parents and not doing enough to rescue the girls. #BringBackOurGirls was a global campaign launched on social media to secure the release of the girls. Mr Jonathan agreed to the meeting on Monday following an appeal by Pakistani rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai. Mr Jonathan had planned to meet 12 parents and five girls who escaped shortly after being captured but the parents withdrew at the last minute without giving any reason. "Unfortunately, political forces within the Nigerian chapter of Bring Back Our Girls have decided to take this opportunity to play politics with the situation and the grief of the parents and the girls. They should be ashamed of their actions," he said in a statement. "Those who would manipulate the victims of terrorism for their own benefit are engaging in a similar kind of evil: Psychological terrorism," he added. Mr Jonathan's spokesman Doyin Okupe said the president was "extremely distraught". "He cannot understand this. He cannot fathom this - that Nigeria's mothers will do this type of thing for children," Mr Okupe said. Nigeria is due to hold presidential elections next year. Mr Jonathan has not yet declared his candidature, but speculation is rife that he intends to run for another term. Last year, he declared a state of emergency in the north-eastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, which are worst affected by the insurgency. All three are under opposition control. New York-based Human Rights Watch says more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in Nigeria this year by Boko Haram. The deaths occurred in around 95 separate attacks in more than 70 towns and villages in the north-east, where Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009.	Nigeria's president has accused activists of "playing politics" after his meeting with parents of the abducted schoolgirls was called off.
A crowd of more than 9,000 attended Sunday's testimonial for the 29-year-old left-back against Sunderland. "There are going to be a few new faces coming in," he said after the 2-2 draw with the English Championship side. "But I think we've got the nucleus of a good squad and one that can compete at the top end of the league." Stevenson has been at Easter Road since coming through the Edinburgh club's youth ranks and played 40 times last season as they won the Championship. "The club's come on leaps and bounds, everything's in place and, although it's had its ups and downs, I'm sure there's plenty more success in the future and I'd love to be part of that for a few more years," he told BBC Scotland. Stevenson was in the Hibs side that in 2016 ended the club's 114-year wait to lift the Scottish Cup for a third time - and the League Cup final winning team of 2007. And he says that returning to the top flight as title winners was as big an achievement. "The cup wins we've had have been amazing, but equally winning the league last season was my main goal after we got relegated," said Stevenson. "To be part of a title-winning team is something I'll hold deeply in my memory. "That's your bread and butter, the league, and it was a great achievement and hopefully we can kick on from there. "There is a bit of an expectation on us that we are going to start off flying, but it is going to be tough." Stevenson was delighted with the attendance against the side relegated from England's top flight. "I was probably more nervous about today than I was about the cup final," he said. "It has been amazing and everything I could have dreamed of - a massive turnout from the Hibs fans, which means so much to me." Stevenson was sent out for a solo lap of honour at the final whistle. "It felt a bit surreal," he added. "I'm not really one for the spotlight. I wished the boys were at the back of me. "But it is amazing to see the support that I've had over the years. "It has been tough at times, but the fans have stuck with me because I know there are a few times that they could have turned their back on me." Hibs head coach Neil Lennon paid tribute to the long-serving full-back, who has donated the proceeds to charity. "He wouldn't have enjoyed even the walk around at the end because that's not Lewie - he is very quiet, reserved, a manager's dream," he said. "I think he's worked under nine managers here and been first pick under every one of them. That tells you a lot about the quality of the player, his temperament and his ability." Lennon thought the workout against Sunderland, now managed by Simon Grayson following the departure of David Moyes, was ideal ahead of this weekend's opening League Cup tie against Montrose. "I thought it was a great game," he added. "I was really pleased with the quality of the performance from our players against very good opposition. "It was a very competitive game, very exciting and both goalkeepers got worked a lot."	Lewis Stevenson thinks Hibernian can compete at the top end of the Scottish Premiership after their promotion and plans sticking around for more success.
Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham in Leicestershire, was found dead last November. Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, admitted raping and murdering the teenager at a hearing in April. He and Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, are on trial at Nottingham Crown Court after both denied a charge of false imprisonment. Harlow had also previously pleaded guilty to sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Kayleigh went willingly to Harlow's flat in Ibstock, Leicestershire on 13 November. She believed they were in a "secret relationship" after chatting on Facebook for about a fortnight, the court heard, and had told her family she was staying with her best friend. Harlow - who called himself "Luke Fun Times Harlow" online - told the teenager she was his "princess" who he would "love and treasure forever". "On that night Kayleigh had been given substantial amounts of alcohol and she had been sexually touched by Luke Harlow," said Ms Moore. "She was underage and he knew it.  He was later to lie about that, pretending to people that she was much older." Ms Moore said the false imprisonment charge centred around what happened to Kayleigh between 21:00 and 03:00 BST on 14 and 15 November. Both men are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will. The jury heard that at one point, Kayleigh had tried to escape Harlow's flat and was seen by a witness leaving the property naked from the waist down. "What happened to her in that property to make her flee into the night?" Ms Moore said. "What we know is that she was chased by Mr Beadman and pinned to the ground. This was seen by somebody from their upstairs window. "At some point, far from being this drunken, compliant girl, Kayleigh became somebody who wanted to get out of that flat." Ms Moore said that the witness mistook Beadman for a policeman. Beadman then took her "off into the night, where she was raped and murdered by him". After Beadman had been by interviewed by police for three days and directed officers to a location on the outskirts of Ibstock. Her body was then discovered in thick undergrowth near a stream. Following examinations of Harlow's phone, police discovered he had sought to groom other girls. His intention was to kidnap them, get them drunk, have sex and keep them in his flat, the jury was told. "Kayleigh Haywood was not the only girl Luke Harlow groomed," Ms Moore said. "She was the last in the line." He has also admitted attempting to meet two other underage girls for sexual purposes. Police from across the East Midlands helped with the hunt for the teenager after she went missing on 13 November. A passerby found Kayleigh's smashed phone on the ground in Ibstock. The last number she had dialled was the number of the friend she said she was staying with. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries. The trial - which is expected to last until next week - continues.	A 15-year-old girl was seen fleeing a house half-naked before a man chased, raped and murdered her, a court heard.
His left-wing Social Democrat party (PSD) had accused him of failing to carry out necessary economic reforms. The prime minister was involved in a power struggle with party leader Liviu Dragnea, who was barred from office after a conviction for voter fraud. Mr Grindeanu lost the censure motion by 241 votes to 10. The decision by his own party and its liberal ALDE allies to oust him was seen as a first, even for Romania's turbulent politics. For the motion to pass they needed a parliamentary majority of 233 votes. The PSD won elections in December only a year after losing power. Within weeks, protests erupted across the country over a decree seen as weakening anti-corruption measures in one of the European Union's most corrupt member states. In February the EU warned the government in Bucharest against "backtracking" in its efforts against corruption. Although Mr Grindeanu withdrew the decree, the crisis weakened the new government and soured relations between the prime minister and Mr Dragnea. Mr Dragnea criticised his rival's performance in government on Wednesday, accusing him of failing to push through "the most ambitious programme since 1989". Some commentators have argued that his removal was more about relaxing measures aimed at tackling corruption. Mr Dragnea, while being the power behind the left-wing party's throne, cannot take power because he was given a suspended jail term for vote rigging and also faces trial for alleged abuse of office. His first choice as prime minister, Sevil Shhaideh, was turned down by President Klaus Iohannis in December. A new nominee from the ruling coalition will also have to be approved by the president. Far from being the sick man of Europe, Romania's economy is showing the highest growth in the EU, at 5.6% in the year to March 2017. However, its justice system has been under EU scrutiny ever since the country joined in 2007. In its most recent report this year, the EU's executive praised Romania's anti-corruption agency (DNA) but warned that the fight against corruption was under serious threat from political and media attack.	Romanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu has been forced from power after only six months by his own party, in a no-confidence vote in parliament.
The 28-year-old has scored 37 goals in 98 appearances since joining the Lions from non-league Halifax in 2014. "Lee committing his future to us is a big boost for everybody and a sensible decision from the boy," boss Neil Harris told the club website. "He has played his best football under me and he is a big part of this squad."	Striker Lee Gregory has signed a new contract with League One side Millwall, which will keep him at The Den until the summer of 2018.
About seven miles (11km) of shoreline, including beaches at Great Yarmouth, Gorleston and from Scratby to North Denes, were affected by the flooding. On Scratby beach alone, it is believed there are about 6,000 sq metres (65,000 sq ft) of waste, 3ft deep (1 metre). The operation is expected to take several weeks. Before Christmas, staff from Great Yarmouth Borough Council took away any potentially hazardous material, including gas bottles, fridges and freezers. Now workers are left with glass, wire and wood to dispose of. George Jarvis, from Great Yarmouth Borough Services, said a lot of manpower was being used to sift through the debris. "We did consider burning on the beach, but looking at the weather forecast we're due to have quite a lot of wet weather this week," he said. "Also the prevailing winds coming in from the sea would have blown quite a lot of thick, black smoke into public areas." There is no estimate for the total cost of the clear-up, as it is not yet known how long it will take. The council hopes to recoup the money spent through the government's Bellwin Scheme. The Bellwin Scheme was introduced in the 1980s to provide some government support for flood-hit areas, but only provides funds for temporary flood measures and the work must be undertaken within two months of the flood.	Work has begun to clear up hundreds of tonnes of waste washed up on Norfolk beaches during last month's North Sea tidal surge.
It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year. The losses will come in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which is splitting from the printer and PC business. The company says the cuts will save $2.7bn (Â£1.76bn) in annual costs, although the plan will cost $2.7bn to carry out. At a meeting for Wall Street analysts, chairman and chief executive Meg Whitman said: "We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring." The new structure proposed by Ms Whitman sees HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees. "The number is sadly larger than some people might have expected, but I think it's a reflection of how much trouble HP has been having with its services," said Charles King, analyst at the Silicon Valley IT consulting firm Pund-IT. "I'm frankly not sure if HP is finished with the layoffs." The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce. The proportion of workers in what HPE calls "low-cost locations" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018. The tech company has struggled over the last decade to keep up with changing demands as customers move away from desktop computers. However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn. The company famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and grew to be the guiding light of what became known as Silicon Valley. Its fortunes started to decline with a series of expensive and much criticised acquisitions including Compaq for $25bn in 2002, consultants EDS for $14bn in 2008 and Autonomy for $11bn in 2011. In 2012 it lost its position as the world's leading supplier of PCs to Lenovo. The share price peaked at the height of the dot.com boom in 2000, and, despite two surges in 2007 and 2010, it has lost some 60% of its value since then.	Hewlett-Packard says it will cut another 25,000-30,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, as it plans to split the company in two.
Italy, Wales' first opponent in the 2017 tournament, have finished bottom of the table 11 times, and Georgia and Romania have been pushing to be included in the top tier. But the 30-year-old, set to win his 46th cap in Rome, believes that would be a premature move. "I think it's a debate to be had in a couple of years time," he said. Italy's captain and talisman Sergio Parisse reacted angrily when the suggestion was put to him during the 2016 tournament. And Six Nations chief executive John Feehan has said relegation will not be introduced in the short to medium term and dismissed criticism of Italy as unfair. Owens expects the Azzuri to pose a serious challenge in Rome, where Wales have lost twice and believes that if relegation is eventually introduced, the teams and players will deal with the issue. "I don't think any team goes into the competition to finish bottom," he said. "If [relegation] comes, it comes and the focus wouldn't change because no side goes into the Six Nations wanting to win the wooden spoon." Italy coach Conor O'Shea has made five changes from the team which lost against Tonga in November for the game against Wales. It is also the first time Wales have faced the Italians since the appointment of their new coaching team. "It's a tough away game, especially Italy first up," he added. "They'll be wanting to build on a good autumn campaign after beating South Africa and they'll have been disappointed losing the last game against Tonga. "But they've had time now with Conor O'Shea, Mike Catt and Brendan Venter in camp. "We know hard it's going to be out there and it's all about getting a good performance first up."	Wales hooker Ken Owens has backed the decision not to introduce relegation from the Six Nations.
Tashan Corpe, 27, died in Sedgemoor Road, Bath, on Sunday. Police have charged 30-year-old Josh Farnham of Old Fosse Road, Bath, with murder, grievous bodily harm with intent and actual bodily harm. Rachel Smith, 42, of Sedgemoor Road, has been charged with assisting an offender. Both appeared before Bristol Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Mr Farnham and Ms Smith were remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Thursday. The crime scene is still cordoned off while officers gather evidence. Det Insp Mike Buck from Avon and Somerset Police said: "Our thoughts are with Tashan's family at this tragic time."	Two people have been charged after a man was stabbed to death in his home.
Solly Msimanga, from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said the vehicles would instead be given to a police anti-hijack unit. However, he will continue to use the luxury car used by the previous mayor. The DA took control of Tshwane, a metropolitan area including the capital Pretoria, from the African National Congress (ANC) in local elections. Mr Msimanga said no more luxury cars would be bought under his leadership. He took over from the governing ANC, which lost control of  the capital for the first time since 1994, last month. More on this and other African stories Four things from South Africa election The ANC bought 10 new BMW 3 series vehicles, which are yet to be delivered, for 5 million rand ($356,000; £266,000), local reports say. The cars were meant for members of the mayoral council, with the ANC said to be confident it would retain control of the municipality in the elections. He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not "be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that". He added: "But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures. He said in a statement: "No new luxury cars will be bought or leased for politicians‚ and if vehicles currently owned by Tshwane require replacement‚ sensible and low-cost vehicles will be procured. "I will not allow public money to be spent on luxury cars‚ while our people struggle for services‚ houses and jobs. "A Hyundai i20 or Toyota Corolla can do the same job for a politician as an expensive sedan." The ANC national government has been criticised for wasteful expenditure, so South Africans will be closely watching what the opposition do differently in the key urban areas they won in the August elections, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. South Africans will be keen to see if the opposition, which has until now only run one province, will be able to make good on its ambitious election promises, our correspondent says.	A new mayor in South Africa says he will give away a fleet of new luxury cars ordered by his predecessors.
The system is being based on the way people fill up their car with petrol or buy data bundles with a mobile phone. The company says it is an attempt to simplify energy bills. ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: "We're saying to people buy it by the day, not by kilowatts or a fancy tariff you don't understand." Customers will use an app that has a gauge measuring consumption. The company will tailor each customer's "day" based on a personalised forecast of how much energy they typically use. This will also vary according to the time of year. Customers will be able to buy packages of gas and electricity in quantities from one day to a month, and up to 180 days ahead. The firm has been piloting the scheme and it says it could transform the way consumers buy energy. Mr Anderson said they went back to scratch and looked at how people bought petrol for their car. "You go to the garage and put Â£50 in your car. Inherently you know that will last you two to three weeks. "We thought why don't we do the same thing with energy." A fuel gauge supplied within the app will then tell customers how much energy they are using and how much they have left. Under the scheme, called "PowerUp", customers will not have to pay a standing charge. Scottish Power said its tariffs for the scheme would include some of the firm's most competitive prices. It will be launched to existing customers initially, and the company firm will then consider whether to open it up to the wider market. A two-year investigation into the energy industry by the competition authorities found that many consumers were not engaged in the energy market and failed to switch to the cheapest deals. The new approach to buying energy has been welcomed by the industry regulator. In a statement, Ofgem said: "We want more competition to increase choice and drive down prices for consumers. "We encourage suppliers to offer new innovative tariffs to help people engage in the market and find the best deal which suits them. "Innovative tariffs can be tailored to an individual consumer's needs and give people more control over their energy bill and how they pay for it." Claire Osborne, energy expert for Uswitch.com said: "Energy bills are notoriously difficult to understand and so this approach, similar to how we buy petrol, should help consumers use less, waste less and pay less for their gas and electricity. "The fact that the deal has no standing charge will be attractive to many customers - particularly those with second homes which are unoccupied for part of the year - as there's nothing to pay on days when no energy is used."	ScottishPower customers will soon be able to buy gas and electricity in bundles of days rather than signing up to standard or fixed-price deals.
Haig's side have won the past six European Nations Cup (ENC) titles - the division below the Six Nations - finished third in their 2015 World Cup pool and completed an unbeaten Pacific Islands tour this summer. There is no imminent prospect of a change to the Six Nations format, despite alterations to rugby's international calendar after the 2019 World Cup. But Haig believes the status quo is hampering Georgia's development, and their World Cup preparations. "Absolutely, we've outgrown the ENC," Haig told BBC Scotland. "You're not being disrespectful to the other teams - you're saying the obvious. "That's why we've started being public about our desire to get into an expanded Six Nations. Not a promotion/relegation system, that's never been our standpoint, it's always been that the Six Nations gets expanded to seven or eight teams, depending on what the current partners feel is applicable." The New Zealander argues: Almost every Tier Two nation agitates for more frequent fixtures against the Six Nations and Rugby Championship heavyweights, but Georgia's case for greater challenges is compelling. The glaring extent of their supremacy in the ENC can be outlined thus: in the last six championships, they've lost just two matches from the 30 played. Their cumulative points difference reads: for 948, against 264. Georgia have lost only once since last year's World Cup - a narrow defeat by Japan - and completed an unbeaten Pacific tour of Tonga, Fiji, and Samoa this summer. Last weekend, they beat the touring Samoans in Tbilisi. A Tier One nation has never played a Test in Georgia, and outside World Cup pool matches, their fixture with Scotland on 26 November will be only the fourth time in 13 years the Lelos have had the opportunity to pit themselves against top-class opposition. "How can you improve [in that situation]? You can't," says Haig. "The Test schedule for the Tier Ones is already done up to 2019, and the big boys sit around the table and work out a deal. "Effectively there are a couple of weekends free to be filled with Tier Two teams. Then we go to a meeting, all the Tier Two guys go into a room and everybody scraps over what's left. "We all have fisticuffs about who's getting what. I'm being facetious to some degree, but that's not too far away from what happens. "It's not easy - that's the summary of that conversation. It's just not easy for Tier Two teams to get more than one or two Tests every year against Tier One teams. "I'm not saying World Rugby doesn't look after us, they've been very good to us and helped us develop, but we need more. "The challenge is that every Tier Two team says they want more, but it's how you prioritise that that's going to be key." Alterations to the present Six Nations format have long been mooted - outgoing World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset called for a promotion/relegation play-off, with the ENC winners playing the team that finishes bottom in the Six Nations, as he left office in April. That seems a fair proposal on the face of it, but Haig says Georgia have to be cannier in their demands. "The reality is, if you were one of those six partners, not one would want to put their seat in jeopardy, and if it was me sitting in their position, I wouldn't either," says the New Zealander. "But if you go to the negotiating table and don't have any cards to play, you've then got to say, 'there's no threat here of anybody losing their seat, all we're asking for is you put one more seat at the table'. "I think for us, that's the smarter way to go. It's also less threatening to the existing partners and it means they're helping to grow the game in eastern Europe. "There's a massive potential market in eastern Europe, and we would say by including Georgia, or Romania or Russia, you might be able to capitalise on that." The prospect of a global season, a closer alignment of the northern and southern hemisphere calendars, has been hotly debated, but Haig fears that scenario would only condense the international windows, and thereby reduce the already scant opportunities for Georgia to take on the "big boys". "We feel if we can't get World Rugby giving us more Tier One Tests, then the obvious solution would be for us to be included in an expanded Six Nations," he says. "Automatically, you get six more Tier One games. And it wouldn't have to go outside the current Test windows. "It would fit into both our calendar and the Six Nations calendar. Nothing has to change, apart from the fact we'd get much better rugby. "And with much better rugby consistently, we'd perform better at a World Cup. That's where we see our future, and that's where we'll keep having those conversations." Domestically, there is broad scope for growth. Georgia, says Haig, is a nation where rugby is on a rapid upward trajectory, and sell-out Tbilisi crowds of 50,000-plus for ENC fixtures are the norm. But in his 30-man November squad, over half play their club rugby in France or England, rather than the semi-professional Georgian leagues. Meanwhile, as they seek innovative methods to combat Anglo-French wealth, the Pro12 league's representatives have been exploring opportunities to incorporate North American teams or franchises. The New Zealander says they've made enquiries with the Georgian union too - and those enquiries are most welcome. "Our union has been approached by the Pro12 - it was just the initial discussions, but we've indicated that absolutely we'd love to have a team in that competition," he says. "We're trying to put our players, whether at international or local level, into better competitions, so that they learn the game and get better. "It's a pathway for our younger players as well. To have a fully professional team in a competition like that, would do us wonders. "That's an obvious step that we'd like to continue conversations so that hopefully we can within a couple of years get that up and running." The Georgian game has one vital fillip, absent from many of its Tier Two counterparts, that may help smooth its ascent - money. Where the Pacific teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are hampered by modest revenue and ramshackle infrastructure, Georgian rugby is bankrolled by former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Forbes Magazine puts Ivanishvili's net worth at $4.8bn (£3.89bn). That's over $1bn more than US president-elect Donald Trump ($3.7bn), and just shy of Richard Branson ($4.9bn). In almost five years as head coach, Haig has never actually met the man whose wealth is propelling his vision, but its impact is apparent everywhere. "When I first came here and saw our high-performance base, not even New Zealand had something like that, and probably still doesn't," says Haig. "We have our own 27-room hotel, swimming pool, commercial kitchen, gymnasium, grandstand, one artificial field, one natural field, fully-lit to international standards. "It's incredible what we've got here, and we've continued to improve our high-performance centre. "We've just built a 14x14m fully-covered wrestling dojo that we do a lot of our contact work in. "Prior to the World Cup, I said, it'd be great if we had this, because it'll help us get better, and bang - it was built in 10 minutes. When you have the ability to do that, it helps everything we're doing. "He's not at all a rugby fanatic. He's a very private man. He understands what rugby's doing for the country and the people, and that's why he's happy to invest in the infrastructure, and our day-to-day costs are always covered by the government. "If we've got the opportunity to be sitting at that Six Nations table, it becomes a whole different landscape for Georgian rugby. "And I'd be pretty confident that whatever was necessary in terms of funding or building more infrastructure, he'd be the first to put his hand up and say, yes, we can do that." Haig remains upbeat that as he continues to add tactical nous, game understanding and more polished skill-sets to the historically formidable physical profile of the Georgian squad, and its momentum continues to snowball, there is light at the end of the tunnel. He sees parallels with Argentina, whose case for top-tier rugby eventually grew so irrefutable that they were invited to join the Rugby Championship in 2012 and Super Rugby in 2016, with most of their Test squad contracted to Buenos Aires-based franchise, the Jaguares. And Haig is increasingly reassured by what he perceives to be a change in attitude among the powers-that-be - he says the notion of a bigger Six Nations no longer seems so distant. "Rugby in Georgia just keeps growing," says Haig. "Player numbers for kids are growing; it's getting bigger and bigger. "As we build more infrastructure throughout the country, more stadiums, more fields, it's the old adage - if you build it, they will come, and that's been the mantra for us. "If one of those top nations came to Georgia to play, I can guarantee you we'd be packing out the biggest stadium in Georgia, and it'd be an atmosphere they maybe hadn't experienced for some time. "I understand that London, Paris, Rome, are all very nice places, but again I think if you are a touring team or tourist coming to play or watch a game in Tbilisi will be an experience you probably haven't had before. "We're certainly pretty confident within the next four or five years, it's going to happen. "And the first time it does, it's going to be a big occasion for the country. That's what we keep holding onto - that one day, it's going to happen, and for our country that'll be awesome."	Georgia head coach Milton Haig believes his side merit a place in an expanded Six Nations Championship, and says Tier Two nations are "fighting for scraps" in the battle to earn fixtures against top opposition.
Ex-French Minister for Health and Sport Roselyne Bachelot said Nadal's seven-month absence in 2012 was "probably due to a positive doping test". Nadal, 29, has denied ever doping and the Spanish Olympic Committee said he had passed "countless doping tests". Real Madrid have defended Nadal from "the attacks made on his person". A club statement said: "Rafa Nadal represents the fundamental values of sport. "His greatness and his incredible achievements have always been based upon a foundation of exemplary conduct, unwavering work, talent and astonishing levels of commitment. "This being the case, our institution considers the attacks made on his person by former minister Roselyne Bachelot to be unjustifiable and unacceptable." Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane added: "I feel bad for Rafa Nadal because he is a gentleman, a person that has shown the values he has and that everyone loves. "He is a professional and I know him a little. I feel bad for what they have said. "He has to leave all this to one side and think that everyone who loves sport, loves Rafa Nadal, whether they be French, Spanish or American." Nadal, who has won 14 Grand Slam titles, was out for seven months from July 2012 with tendinitis and then a stomach virus. The Spaniard was asked on Wednesday about the subject of doping, in the light of Maria Sharapova's admission last week of a failed test. "I am a completely clean guy," said the former world number one. "I have never had the temptation of doing something wrong."	Real Madrid backed "exemplary" club member Rafael Nadal after the tennis star was accused by a former French minister of failing a drugs test.
Salman Ramadan Abedi, 22, detonated a homemade device in the foyer of Manchester Arena following an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. The five-minute hearing was adjourned until 1 December, pending the police investigation. Twenty-two people were killed in the arena attack. No members of Abedi's family were present at court, which was sitting at Manchester Town Hall. A full inquest will be heard once the police investigation into the attack has been completed. The court heard Abedi died of "multiple injuries" when he detonated an improvised explosive device. He was later identified by genetic markers and his bank card that was found nearby, the court heard. The inquests for the victims were opened with a minute's silence on 9 June and adjourned until November. Coroner Nigel Meadows said the victims' inquests, at Manchester Civil Justice Centre, would be adjourned until 24 November and this was a "holding date" which could be moved if the police investigation was still ongoing. The hearing on 9 June was shown a photograph of each of the victims and told of their injuries. Those who died were aged between eight and 51. A map of where 19 of those killed in the foyer was also shown to the hearing.  The court heard a further three - John Atkinson, Georgina Callander and Saffie Roussos - died later in hospital. Some of those who died were standing very close to the bomber, with others as far as 20m (66ft) away. A further 116 people were injured in the attack.	An inquest into the death of the Manchester suicide bomber heard how he was identified by DNA, fingerprint and dental records.
Pedrosa, who almost quit the sport this year because of an arm injury, took the lead seven laps from the end. Rossi's Yamaha team-mate and championship rival Jorge Lorenzo was third after suffering tyre problems. Rossi now leads Lorenzo by 18 points in the standings with a maximum of 75 available from the final three rounds. Only those two drivers can win the title, meaning Marc Marquez's two-year reign as world champion is over. Pedrosa, whose career began in the 125cc class in 2001, had not won a MotoGP race since the Czech Grand Prix in August 2014 and missed three of the season's first four races after arm surgery. "I couldn't go fast in the beginning," said the 30-year-old. "But at the end my pace was faster and could win the race. I am very happy." Meanwhile, San Marino rider Alex de Angelis is in a "critical condition" with bleeding inside his brain, following a crash in practice on the eve of the race. The 31-year-old is sedated in the intensive care unit of Dokkyo Medical University Hospital, with race doctor Michele Zasa stating an MRI scan had showed he had a brain haemorrhage. De Angelis, who competes for Team e-motion Iodaracing, also fractured five vertebrae and two ribs, and suffered a slight fracture of the sternum and the left collarbone. Meanwhile, British rider Danny Kent edged closer to winning the Moto3 title by finishing sixth in his race, one place ahead of main rival Enea Bastianini. Kent now leads the Italian by 56 points with three races remaining. The 21-year-old, from Chippenham, is attempting to become the first British world champion since Barry Sheene in 1977.	Spain's Dani Pedrosa claimed the 50th Grand Prix win of his career with victory over championship leader Valentino Rossi in the Japanese MotoGP.
Over the past five years, an estimated 70,000 people have left their homes and moved to the gold fields, seeking - if not their fortunes - a way of feeding their families. When I visited Mubende a few weeks ago the dusty hillside was crawling with activity, as if an imaginary film director had shouted "action" on the set of an old Western movie. Everywhere you looked, people were busy. Young men with muddy faces climbed out of pits 150 metres deep, hauling huge sacks of rubble; others were busy breaking down clumps of rock, loading up trucks or panning for gold. Women stood in dark puddles, swishing water around plastic tubs, closely watching for a flash of yellow. "In our culture it's taboo for women to go down the pit," the mine chairman told me. "They believe when they go down there, the gold disappears." Instead, several women were working in the many restaurants and shops that had sprung up in the nearby camp. They were stalls selling bananas, chicken and yoghurt. There was also a medical clinic, some churches and a mosque on site. The houses were made of blue plastic sheeting, wood and corrugated iron - the typical shanty houses that I've seen elsewhere in Africa. I visit the local bar, where music is playing - until the power goes off. Men worked in the mines 24 hours a day, but it was clear the operation was completely unregulated. There wasn't a helmet to be seen, and some of the workers weren't wearing any shoes. But no one I met seemed worried by the long hours or poor conditions. Florence Nampijja, who used to sell second-hand clothes, said her life had changed considerably since she joined the gold rush. "With good panning, I'm able to look after my four children and my extended family," she said. "I hope to buy land and put up a good house for my children, feed them well, and send them to better schools." Pit owner Ivan Kauma Male enthusiastically showed me around the site. He had bigger dreams. "When I find gold most of my wishes will be completed," he told me. "Like driving a Porsche car, putting up good houses, and sending my children to good schools." "This is something I've invested in for two and a half years. So I want to get my money out of it." But those dreams have been put on hold. A few days ago Ugandan soldiers armed with tear gas shut down the Mubende mines. They were acting on the instructions of the country's government. The miners and their families were told they had just hours to evacuate the area. Many are still looking for a way to get home. The mines are a four-hour drive from the capital Kampala, and the only road in is a bumpy dirt track. "People are stranded on the road with mattresses, jerry cans, saucepans and children," Ivan told me, speaking on the phone from a nearby village. The Ugandan government issued a statement blaming the shutdown on unsafe mining practices, and the presence of foreigners in the camps. The miners say the vast majority of people living in the camps are Ugandan. But they acknowledge the mining was illegal. No one had a license. Mark Asaph Jjombwe heads up the Artisinal and Small Scale Miners Association. "The association tried to get a license, although they've not yet replied to us," he says. The miners say Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni knew about the illegal mining, but chose to ignore it. Mark explains: "He knows we cannot dig the big gold. So he says, 'You can have those petty, petty ones. My people, you go and try your luck'." But that appears to be over for now at least. A statement from Uganda's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development said the miners will be registered over the next three months, and the industry will be regulated. But the miners are sceptical. "The government believes the investors are going to bring a pack of money, more than the artisans who can actually generate some income for their children," says Ivan. "In Uganda we are jobless. I hold a degree in electrical engineering. It's not because I don't want to do my work, but they cannot pay me." The watchdog Global Witness recently criticised the Ugandan mining industry, describing it as "infested with corruption from bottom to top". The group accused a former government minister of processing and exporting hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold. The mines in Mubende District had meant the country's riches weren't just in the hands of the elite. Now, thousands of Ugandans are jobless again.	For many Ugandans, the gold found deep underground in the hills of Mubende District was a lifeline.
The train was suspended last week after two incidents in which passenger doors opened mid-journey. The refurbished trains are due to run on the Belfast to Dublin route from the end of February. Translink said that the suspension has been lifted after an investigation of the door mechanisms. "We would strongly reassure our passengers and the wider public that there was no imminent danger for our customers travelling on board as a result of these two unrelated door faults," said Ian Campbell, general manager of engineering at Translink. "We have worked closely with the Railway Safety Commission (RSC) and, having satisfied their concerns, the upgraded train will now be returned into service this afternoon (Wednesday 13 January)." Translink has previously described the refurbished trains as a "major milestone" in its £12.2m NI railways upgrade programme.	A newly-refurbished Enterprise train is back in service after having its safety licence in the Republic of Ireland restored.
Thanet District Council (TDC) was court ordered to lift a ban on live animal exports through the Port of Ramsgate. It paid more than £5m in compensation to traders but has not submitted an insurance claim to retrieve any money. Campaigners said taxpayers had been left to foot the bill as the council missed the deadline. Ian Driver, a community campaigner and former councillor, said the figures had only just come to light after a Freedom of Information request. Mr Driver, said: "So there you have it: a major administrative cock-up by TDC means that taxpayers have been forced to foot a £5.1 million bill some, if not all, of which would have been covered by insurance payments had the claim been submitted in time. But it wasn't." TDC said the maximum payment under the policy was £1m. A spokesman said: "The legal claims against the council have all been settled and accounted for in previous year's budgets." TDC banned live animal exports in 2012 after the deaths of more than 40 sheep. The decision was overturned by the High Court in 2014 after a long legal battle. Mr Justice Birss said the council was liable to pay damages to three companies affected by the ban. Two sheep drowned at Ramsgate in September 2012 and 44 had to be destroyed as they were sick and lame. The animals were put down after the lorry carrying them was stopped at Ramsgate by animal health inspectors. In a separate incident, a loading area floor also collapsed while sheep were taken off a lorry carrying 548 animals. Six fell in the water, with four rescued by RSPCA officers while two animals drowned. The live animal export trade resumed through Ramsgate in July 2015.	A council has been accused of a "major administrative cock-up" after failing to make an insurance claim for up to £1m.
The corporation had charged users subscription fees to watch programmes via the app in Western Europe, Australia and Canada. However, it never came to the US. Reports suggest American pay-TV operators had threatened to drop the BBC America channel if the app had launched locally because they believed it would cost them viewers. Both BBC America and the international edition of iPlayer screen some of the corporation's best known programmes, including Doctor Who, Top Gear, Sherlock and David Attenborough's natural history documentaries. Press releases had always described the online facility as a "pilot" meant to provide "consumer insights". BBC Worldwide - the broadcaster's commercial arm -  first announced it intended to pull support for the Global iPlayer app in October 2013, saying it would instead focus on making material available via the BBC.com website. The corporation repeated the point in its annual review last July, but until now had not provided an exact shut-off date. "As announced in July 2014, the service will be closing this year as planned," said a spokeswoman. "The service will close on 26 June." She declined to provide usage statistics. The global iPlayer app was first made available as an iOS app in July 2011 but was never extended beyond Apple's platform. European users were charged a €5.99 (£4.30) monthly fee, while Canadians and Australians were offered a slightly cheaper rate of 6.99 Canadian dollars (£3.70) and 7.49 Australian dollars (£3.80). The content provided was distinct from that offered via the UK version, including older shows from the corporation's library in addition to recently broadcast programmes. In total, more than 2,000 hours of shows were on offer on the global edition of iPlayer, including Gavin and Stacey, Fawlty Towers, Planet Earth and "classic" episodes of Doctor Who. Users have been notified of the switch-off, and auto-renewing subscriptions are being cancelled. "We would like to thank all of our subscribers for using the service. We are now developing plans to launch new digital services across multiple devices," reads a statement on BBC Worldwide's site.	The BBC has confirmed the "global" version of its iPlayer on-demand service will close next month.
The so-called Christmas Blitz on the evening of 22 December reduced shops and buildings in St Ann's Square to ruins. The area around Deansgate near the cathedral was badly damaged, with a large bomb crater marking the road. War Office photographer William Lockeyear took a series of images as buildings burned and masonry came tumbling down. The sky glowed orange as huge clouds of smoke billowed and thickened the air with dust. The pungent whiff of burning wood and the smell of powdered brick and plaster lingered. Two waves of bombs pounded the city from 20:00 GMT on 22 December, only ending at 06:00 the next day. Among the buildings hit in the heart of the city were Manchester's Free Trade Hall, the Royal Exchange, Smithfield Market, Cheethams Hospital, the Gaiety Theatre and St Ann's Church. In total, 684 people died and a further 2,300 were wounded with districts to the north and east of the city badly affected, notably Cheetham Hill and Strangeways. At least 8,000 homes were made uninhabitable. During the war as a whole, 1,400 civilians died in Manchester, so the raid represents almost half those killed. One in 10 of was under the age of 13. Seven-year-old Doreen Herring saw a Luftwaffe plane flying overhead as her family, from Pendleton, made their way to an air raid shelter. They looked up and saw the pilot pause and then the plane sped ahead without dropping a bomb. "I am convinced it was because he could see us," she said. Her father, George Pinder, refused to go to the air raid shelter and said: "If a bomb wants to get me, it will get me." They were terrified of seeing if their house had been damaged when leaving the shelter. "Next door to us had been bombed to bits. "All you wanted to do afterwards was to have a cup of tea." She remembers there were a lot of children's funerals and the disgusting smell of rotten food after the bombing ended. "You could breathe again," she added, when the raids were over. People coped by cooking using broken furniture in their gardens that they would burn on fires to create heat. If water mains were damaged, they would drink water from bowsers. Father George Street, 34, who had spent all night helping people amid the bombing, died when the church of St Augustine in York Street took a direct hit. A collage of mangled chalices and church items is now on the wall of the new church in All Saints Place, off Oxford Road. The current incumbent, Father Dave Lannon, said Father Street had offered his usual chair to another priest. Had he stayed there "he would have survived". Geoffrey Whittle was 12 when he was evacuated twice from the home he shared in Gorton with his grandmother to the leafy suburbs of Bramhall. However, he hated it there - his hosts imposed a "cruel" regime of being forced to eat the previous day's leftovers - and he was back in Gorton when the raid took place. He remembers closing all the curtains when the air raid sirens went off and being scared of any light showing through. "We were all settled in this brick shelter about 500 yards away from the house in Greave Street, Gorton. Then this man would play the piano accordion and sing war songs. "Everyone would be singing along and I don't remember getting any sleep in the shelter." Susan Jones, 16 at the time, was shopping in Ancoats as the bombs started dropping. She watched pieces of shrapnel hitting the buildings and sparking and bouncing off. She took refuge in the shelter near the Avro Manchester factory, where she was working as a riveter and driller on Lancaster bombers. The sight of several cockroaches scuttling across the shelter led her to volunteer for fire warden duties on the factory roof. "The shrapnel started coming down and one bit hit a wall of one of the big mills," she said. "I could see sparks and I was hugging the wall to try and stay safe. I wasn't frightened because of my age at the time, I thought I was indestructible and found it dead exciting." One of her relatives was hit in the face by an incendiary device during the raids, but survived. "It was a dreadful thing," she said of the Christmas Blitz. "I looked up at the sky and it seemed like everything was on fire. There was an acrid smell of burning and from the guns. The sky was all orange and yellow it looked like the fireworks I'd seen at Belle Vue when I was younger." Historian Ian Kikuchi, from the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford, said there had been few fatalities in Manchester until the Christmas Blitz. "The heaviest bombing previously had been in the East End of London," he said. "The Luftwaffe launched bombings across Britain as they were trying to disrupt food supply and were targeting ports and centres of distribution." Mr Kikuchi said the Germans bombed Coventry in November 1940 because of its strategic position in heavy industry, but the focus soon shifted to other cities across Britain. He said the raids had been anticipated by British intelligence. "What was surprising was the intensity of the raids," he said. "The Luftwaffe saw Manchester as an adjunct to the port of Liverpool, which was a major industrial centre."	As the Christmas of 1940 approached, German bombs rained down on Manchester city centre, killing hundreds of people and causing widespread destruction.
Attorneys for Dr David Dao, who lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and "significant" concussion in the incident, say they will sue. His daughter, Crystal Dao Pepper, told the news conference in Chicago they are "sickened" by his treatment. Video of the incident has been watched millions of times online. Law enforcement officials dragged Dr Dao off Sunday evening's Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, flight because it was fully booked, and the airline wanted four passengers to make way for staff members. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician had refused to leave, saying he needed to go home to see his patients. Lawyer Thomas Demetrio told journalists on Thursday: "He [Dr Dao] said that he left Vietnam in 1975 when Saigon fell and he was on a boat and he said he was terrified. "He said that being dragged down the aisle was more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam." Ms Dao Pepper, who lives in suburban Chicago, said: "What happened to my dad should have never happened to any human being, regardless of the circumstance. "We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what happened to him and to see what happened to him." Dr Dao's lawyers have filed an emergency court request for the airline to preserve evidence ahead of a hearing next Monday morning. The filing with an Illinois state court demands that United Airlines and the city of Chicago preserve all surveillance videos, cockpit voice recordings, passenger and crew lists related to the flight. United Airlines said it would refund the ticket costs of all passengers on Sunday's flight. Dr Dao was released on Wednesday night from a Chicago hospital, his lawyer said, adding that he planned to have reconstructive surgery. Mr Demetrio, and a second lawyer for Mr Dao, said that neither they nor the Dao family had heard from United Airlines yet. "For a long time airlines, United in particular, have bullied us," Mr Demetrio told the press conference. "We want respect and we want dignity, that's it! Not a big deal." The lawyer said he did not believe Mr Dao's race played a factor, despite an email he had received suggesting he was "the modern day, Asian Rosa Parks", a reference to the civil rights activist who refused to give up her seat on an Alabama bus in 1955. Mr Demetrio also said the family had not heard from United yet. But the airline said in a statement that its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, and the company had "called Dr Dao on numerous occasions to express our heartfelt and deepest apologies". The company did not comment on the potential litigation. On Wednesday, United's CEO said he felt "shame and embarrassment" and vowed it would never happen again. More than 150,000 thousand people have signed online petitions calling for Mr Munoz to resign, but he has refused to do so. The CEO said Dr Dao had not been at fault, adding "no one should be treated that way. Period." However, Mr Munoz initially described Dr Dao as "disruptive and belligerent". The airline has confirmed it is offering compensation to customers on United Flight 3411 for their flights. Three aviation security officers involved in removing Dr Dao from the plane have been "placed on leave", says the Chicago Department of Aviation. The US Department of Transportation is reviewing whether United complied with rules on booking.	A man dragged screaming off a United Airlines flight described his ordeal as "more horrifying" than his experiences in the Vietnam War, his lawyer says.
Spencer Wilding, who hails from Rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of Rogue One. He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his Vader role secret until the film's release. "It's a hell of a secret to keep," said Wilding, who was cast as the body actor for the role. "But when you're a professional actor - when you sign that black and white sheet of paper saying you cannot say a word... I'm true to my word and I didn't say anything." Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme, the 44-year-old said it proved a tricky task after rumours of the role leaked a year ago. "I've been having hundreds of people every day for a year asking me if I'm Vader," he said. "If I had a pound for everyone who asked I'd be buying myself a new Death Star - and it'd be gold plated." The 6ft 7in (2m) tall actor already has a string of Hollywood appearances to his name, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Green Lantern, three Harry Potter films and the TV blockbuster Game of Thrones. He said the Vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to Pinewood Studios. "It's very, very secretive. We didn't even know exactly what the character was and what film it was until we got there," he said. "I opened up the curtain when I went in the dressing room and there he was - Vader. "Anybody out there who got into that costume and got an audition to be Darth Vader alone is very exciting, so to pull the character off as well, it's like 'What!' "I'm always pinching myself - I am definitely awake - it is not a dream, it is just another dream come true." While the actor has the body role, just like his predecessor in the original Star Wars films David Prowse, the voice of Lord Vader is actor James Earl Jones. That did not stop Wilding trying out the voice during filming. "I'm not James Earl Jones - nowhere near him - but you know I got close to him I think, which helped the other actors - you know, you've got Vader in front of you."	Darth Vader and Imperial Stormtroopers have invaded a Denbighshire seaside town to welcome the actor who plays the infamous villain.
Like-for-like sales were up by 4.9% during the quarter compared with a year earlier, in part due to the continued success of meal deals. The company said it would continue to benefit from "low cost pressures and a stronger consumer environment". But it warned that wage pressures could drive costs up next year. Chief executive Roger Whiteside told the BBC that the chain already paid staff more than the national minimum wage, but that rising labour costs would lead to "longer term inflationary pressure". He said the business would "look for cost efficiencies to offset" any rising costs, but added that labour costs "held no fear for us". Shares in Greggs opened sharply higher and continued to climb in afternoon trading. "The good times continue to roll for Greggs, with the bakery chain posting an impressive third quarter performance, following on from a dynamic 51.3% increase in first half pre-tax profits," said George Scott at retail analyst Conlumino. The chain said meal deals, where customers can buy a drink together with food at a discount, were proving popular, particularly at breakfast time. Greggs has refitted 158 stores this year, while opening 65 and closing 47. The company now has 1,668 outlets. "We have the High Street pretty well covered," Mr Whiteside said, so most new openings would be in other areas, such as motorway services and garage forecourts.	Shares in Greggs have jumped more than 10% after the bakery chain reported stronger than expected sales for the July-to-September period.
Children in P6 and P7 will learn how to cope with change under the Healthy Me programme developed by Northern Ireland charity, Action Mental Health. Its chief executive David Babington said it will help prepare pupils for the stresses of the transfer test and big changes in their educational life. Five schools took part in a pilot. The charity is now hoping the programme will be rolled out in schools across Northern Ireland. It consists of "interactive workshops" in which pupils are made aware of the importance of emotional wellbeing; encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support. The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing. The Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, on Friday morning. The school's pastoral care co-ordinator, Helen Hamilton, is also its P7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move. "I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school," Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI. "No fault of the secondary school - they're excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they're apprehensive too and a lot of the time, that can be fed down from parents as well, they're worried about them. "You're going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day, and gets to know them and their wee quirks and can spot very quickly if they're out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour. "It's more difficult for them to pick up on those things, much as they try, so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect." Getting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however, and last month, thousands of P7 pupils began to sit this year's unofficial transfer tests, set by two different examination bodies, the Association of Quality Education (AQE) and GL Assessment. Pupils have the choice to sit either test, both tests, or none, but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year, with a total of 14,681, a rise from 14,575 in 2015. "Transition from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P6/P7 children will help them cope with this transition," Mr Babington said. "Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health, so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives," the Action Mental Health boss added. Ms Hamilton said that in the workshops, children were taught breathing exercises, and "how to relax", including how to take time out from busy after-school activity regimes. "We, as a school, value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who, mentally and emotionally, aren't ready to learn cannot progress, so   it's so important for us that children's social and emotional needs are met," the P7 teacher added. The need to "strengthen the resilience of young people" is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland's education system, according to the chief inspector of schools, Noelle Buick. "All young people need to build resilience," she wrote in her  latest report, published last month.. The chief inspector said pupils were facing "complex challenges" because the "social context of relationships, values, attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly" in recent years. "It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum."	Pupils preparing to leave primary school are being taught how to deal with stress and to be more resilient as part of a new mental health initiative.
Elizabeth Passmore's final report before retirement complains admissions are too often "unnecessarily complex", "unfair" or unclear. Schools which are their own admissions authorities, like academies or faith schools, are more likely to be at fault, says the report. The government said it would review the findings and take action where needed. England's School Admissions Code requires places to be offered in a fair and open way, with arrangements set out so that parents can "understand easily how places for that school will be allocated". Admission arrangements run by local authorities for community and voluntary controlled schools "are almost always clear and uncomplicated so it is easy for parents and others to understand how places will be allocated" says the report, published late last year. But "the complexity of some schools' admission arrangements continues to be a matter of concern," writes Dr Passmore. "The arrangements set by some own-admission authority schools have so many levels of priority that often it is unclear how the arrangements could actually be applied." These complex arrangements can include numerous oversubscription criteria, different sub-categories of places, more than one catchment area, feeder schools, banding tests and aptitude assessments, says the report. "The complex arrangements of some schools do not serve local children well," adds Dr Passmore. Too often, says the report, admission arrangements are hard to find on school websites or not published at all, while some faith schools ask parents to fill in supplementary forms, asking for information prohibited under the code. Dr Passmore says banding tests are proving a particular problem. Schools say they use them to ensure a comprehensive intake but the report suggests they can be used to increase numbers of higher ability pupils. "Children living near the school, but placed in a band with many similar children, may not be allocated a place," says the report. "The first hurdle in gaining a place is to take the test." These tests are also expensive, up to Â£500 per child to administer, and the report questions the effects of banding on children, its purpose and costs. Dr Passmore also said she was "surprised and concerned" by an increase in schools operating as their own admissions authorities employing lawyers when they receive objections to the criteria they use to admit children. "Schools should be able to construct lawful arguments to their arrangements without recourse to legal advice," she writes. Overall the report notes the adjudicator dealt with 218 admissions cases in 2014-15, down from 274 the previous year, but the number upheld or partially upheld rose to 159, from 99 in 2013-14. And local authorities withdrew 284 offers of school places because of fraud, up from 186 the previous year. Margaret Tulloch of the Comprehensive Futures campaign group described the report as "very disturbing" and called for a "wholesale review of school admissions". "She is right to raise concerns about own-admission authority schools failing to meet the requirement of the code and about so-called fair banding. "These problems will only increase as more schools become academies." A Department for Education spokesman said the government wanted every child to have the opportunity of going to a good local school. "The chief adjudicator's annual report helps us identify how we can continue to improve the admissions framework to ensure fair access for all children. "We will review her findings and take action where appropriate." said the spokesman.	Too many schools in England break the rules on admissions arrangements, says the outgoing chief schools adjudicator.
The Harlequins centre will lead Wales in June Tests against Tonga and Samoa while the Lions take on New Zealand. Roberts, 30, played for the Lions in 2009 and 2013 but was not selected this time by Warren Gatland. "I was gutted for about a day or two and then you refocus and you go again and you use it as motivation," he said. "You respond to it in one of two ways. You mope around and continue to mope around, or you dust yourself off and you go again. "I've played some good rugby in the last few weeks for my club at Harlequins and I'm thoroughly looking forward to this tour. "And I suppose being captain gives me extra incentive." Roberts has started 83 of his 91 Tests for Wales but only one since they lost heavily to Australia in November. "I was disappointed with the autumn series, in particular against Australia," said Roberts. Roberts acknowledges he "deserved" to be dropped for his performance against the Wallabies. "It was a bad day at the office and I paid the price for it," he said. "Hopefully that's given me a kick up the backside to go again, and in the Six Nations it was disappointing not to get a shot at starting." With 12 Wales players in the Lions squad, Roberts will lead a squad including 13 uncapped players. It will be his first experience of captaining a side since he led Cardiff Schools Under-15s. Wales' first Test is part of an Auckland double-header on Friday, 16 June, with their game against Tonga preceding New Zealand's match against Samoa. A week later, Wales will be in Apia to take on Samoa. Roberts said: "For me, the fundamental thing is having the time of your life and being accountable. "I want the young lads to have the time of their lives playing for their country. "It's a hugely privileged position we're in to play rugby for Wales. It's every boy's dream, really, and I want them to have the most fun possible. "I truly believe you do your best work when you truly enjoy what you're doing." Tonga have not beaten Wales in seven attempts, but Samoa have won four of the teams' nine matches. Roberts said: "The biggest challenge for this group - and we weren't good at it in the Six Nations - is performing away from home. "We know the comforts of the Principality Stadium, we know the motivation that gives Welsh players. Unfortunately, in the Six Nations, we didn't perform in Scotland and France. That is going to be the challenge. "To embrace the occasion and pressure is what we want from the players - to embrace the environment and not be afraid of it."	Jamie Roberts intends to use his disappointment at being overlooked by the British and Irish Lions as motivation when he captains Wales.
Sylvia Blackburn, 72, suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School, Kempston, last December. Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun. He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care. Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's "world upside down". Mr Wright said: "I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children. "I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family." Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, the jury heard. The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school. When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped, but the defendant did not, and hit her. Mr Wright, of The Dell, said he could not remember if the traffic lights were red or green. "I was totally blinded by the sun," he said. "I just heard a bump. I was in total shock. "Since that day I have thought of nothing else other than Sylvia Blackburn and her family and the position I have put them in." The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright's eyes. The trial continues.	A driver who knocked down a lollipop lady broke down in tears in court as he said he was "truly sorry" for her and her family.
The government is currently negotiating with the Lib Dems and Greens to strike a deal to get its budget plans passed. Green co-convener Patrick Harvie has asked for concessions over tax, while Lib Dem Willie Rennie has targeted up to £400m of additional spending. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he is "positive" about winning support. With the SNP a minority government, they will need at least one opposition party to help the budget pass, either by voting for it or by abstaining. Mr Mackay has indicated a budget deal with the Conservatives or Labour is unlikely, but said there was "room for manoeuvre" in talks with the Lib Dems and Greens. And while he has said no matters are "absolutely closed", he wants to "adhere as close to the [SNP] manifesto as possible" on tax, making a deal with the Lib Dems the more likely. The Lib Dems said they wanted "substantial changes" made, which would "set Scotland on a stronger, more liberal path". These focus on the party's manifesto pledges around education and mental health. Specific measures include: Mr Rennie said: "Liberal Democrats will not agree to the draft budget as it stands and will need these substantial changes. If we don't get what the country needs then we will walk away. "Our plan invests for a step change in mental health and a transformation in education that will help in the road to a liberal Scotland. A properly funded pupil premium and more money for colleges will create that opportunity and boost jobs and the economy. "New investment in mental health services will boost this Cinderella service and make the whole NHS more sustainable in the future. We have also included support for alcohol and drug services, a higher budget for the police and lower cost transport for the Northern Isles. "I have had a number of meetings and discussions with the finance secretary so far and I am looking forward to receiving his response to our plan." Mr Mackay has defended his tax and spending plans in two meetings of the finance committee, where he also took questions from the public over social media. The committee will submit its report on the budget on Friday 27 January, with the first chamber debate on the budget the following week. The final vote on the budget will follow a separate vote on Mr Mackay's tax proposals, in the week beginning 20 February. This is a decent snapshot of what the final budget deal is likely to look like. Willie Rennie probably won't get absolutely everything he is asking for - one would suspect Derek Mackay is too good a negotiator for that - but this is a far more palatable list of demands for the finance secretary than that put forward by the Greens, who want to see some movement over tax. While he says nothing is off the table, Mr Mackay isn't going to budge on tax. He sees his current proposals as well-balanced, and endorsed by the electorate last May. And with a deal with Labour or the Tories more or less dismissed in advance on political grounds, that leaves Mr Rennie as the clear favourite. He may well have beefed up his demands accordingly - minus any red lines, of course, over tax. There are plenty of talks still to come, but there is also plenty common ground here. Expect a SNP/Lib Dem coalition to usher an amended budget through come the end of February.	The Liberal Democrats have set out funding for education, mental health and transport links as their demands for backing the Scottish budget.
French President Francois Hollande expressed "deep sadness" at the death of Huguette Dupeu in a statement. Most of the dead in the raid were foreign tourists. Two of the attackers were killed by security forces. A huge march against terrorism is planned for Sunday that will finish outside the Bardo museum. President Hollande is among those expected at the event in the capital Tunis. Lyse Doucet: Tunisia's test of transition Cradle of 'Arab Spring' under threat The museum's planned reopening earlier this week was postponed over security concerns. Schoolchildren and students were allowed in on Friday, with the general public to be readmitted Monday. The attack, claimed by Islamic State (IS), was the deadliest in Tunisia since the uprising which led to the overthrow of long-serving ruler  Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. Over 20 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although just two gunmen are thought to have carried out the raid. They are said to have been trained in Libya in an area controlled by IS. The Tunisian Prime Minister, Habib Essid, has admitted "shortcomings" in the country's security system and has dismissed six police chiefs over the attack.	A Frenchwoman injured in the attack on Tunisia's national museum has died of her wounds, bringing the total killed in the assault by Islamists to 22.
That is the unusual sporting journey Sophie Hitchon, 25, has made on her way to competing in her second Olympics, in Rio, this summer. At the age of 14, Hitchon, from Burnley, had been practicing ballet for over 10 years. Three years later, she would be crowned Commonwealth Youth Games gold medallist in the hammer. "It was a bit of a whirlwind," her father Michael told BBC Sport. "In the space of 12 months she'd gone from not being able to throw, to an Under-17 British record." After improving on her British record at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing last summer, she is hoping for even more in Brazil. "Ballet takes a lot of strength in yourself and it helps to develop that from a young age," she told BBC Sport. "It teaches dedication to sport and how to control your direction." Initially focusing on sprint events when she first started track and field, Hitchon took the opportunity to try the hammer throw and has never looked back. "There are plenty of local clubs to have a go at different events, it's all about finding a local club and seeing what's available," she added. "There are lots of young girls getting into it and we'll hopefully see lots of young girls coming through soon." Setting a new Under-17 Women's national record in 2007, she won European Under-23 gold in 2013 and took a bronze medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games two years ago. At the World Championships in Beijing last summer, she improved her British record with a throw of 73.86m. Sophie's father is a former English Schools champion in the 100 metres and initially coached Hitchon when she took up the sport. "The strength aspect of dancing came in really well for a future in sport through balance, poise and strength building," Michael Hitchon added. "It sets the mind and performing in front of people at a young age does all really help." Hitchon is currently coached by former hammer Olympian Tore Gustafsson and trains twice a day, five days a week - this includes throws, weights, running and plyometrics. "It's probably one of the most difficult events in athletics, if not the most difficult," Michael Hitchon continued. "I think the event is under appreciated. They have to be everything really - a sprinter, a jumper and a thrower. "You can get a hammer thrower that can run really fast, throw a long way and jump a long way. It's a bit like being a multi-eventer really. "We estimate she's probably done one-and-a-half-million throws in training. "Her whole mentality is about competing for her country. When she pulls on a British vest it's a massive thing for her." From the competitors of the hammer final at London 2012, gold medallist Tatyana Lysenko along with 11th-placed Maria Bespalova, both from Russia, have since tested positive for banned substances. Sophie Hitchon says she will not let this affect her mentality. "There are a lot of issues in athletics and hopefully the people that can sort it are doing the right things," Hitchon stated. "I can only focus on myself and make sure I'm doing the right things." Michael Hitchon added: "I think a lot of people have known for a long time the situation with drugs. I think a lot of people knew what was going on but refused to deal with the problem. "The girl who suffers is the one who comes 13th and doesn't get a chance to compete for an Olympic medal." The countdown to the Opening Ceremony of Rio 2016 begins this Friday at 20:30 BST on BBC One. Hammer throw qualifying begins at 00:40 BST on Saturday 13 August.	From ballet beginnings to hammer heights.
It was gobsmacking, unbelievable, enthralling and explosive throughout, featuring huge momentum swings and with outstanding individual performances in all three Tests. I thought beforehand that if they lost the first Test the Lions would lose the series 3-0, so I have to give credit to what is the strongest Lions side since 2001, or maybe even 1997, for the way they fought back. The quality shone through both in the players and the coaching. After the first week or so the debate about lack of preparation time died down - that is one for the administrators to sort out behind closed doors. But just think what they could have done with 10 days' more time to get ready - they might even have gone in as favourites against the world champions. This will be a tour remembered for Sean O'Brien's try in the first Test. The Lions may have lost that match but it was a wonder try, and now the lads have managed to draw the series that score will be the one that sticks in the memory. Although that might be the standout moment, to be honest pretty much every moment of every Test was a defining moment - it really was that good. The most significant moment was Sonny Bill Williams' red card in the second Test. You don't know for certain what the outcome would have been had he not been sent off, but it's more than likely New Zealand would have won. That was effectively two defining moments - the impact of his shoulder with Anthony Watson's head, and the moment referee Jerome Garces - correctly - decided it was a red-card offence. It was a huge momentum swing in both the match and the series, although it didn't seem so immediately because the Lions proceeded to give away loads of penalties and slip nine points behind, before finally starting to believe in themselves and scoring two great tries as they fought back to win. Another pivotal moment would have been conversations after the first Test because the Lions had been dominated physically in many cases. The conversations must have been along the lines of looking players in the eye and saying: "Are you genuinely up for this?" Warren Gatland's decision to field the back three of Liam Williams, Watson and Elliot Daly in the second Test was a bit of a surprise but, as before with the coach's decisions, it worked out. And then there's the penalty that then wasn't in the final Test. Sam Warburton dug deep into the Lions' legacy and his own mental reserves to prevent New Zealand doing what they wanted to do with the ball. But arguably his biggest contribution was being respected enough by Romain Poite for the referee to change his decision and decide to award a scrum to New Zealand, rather than a very kickable penalty, right at the end of Saturday's decider. It was huge because, unless I've got the rules wrong, it was a penalty as the ball was avoidable for Ken Owens, while a scrum says contact was accidental. He caught it and although it was maybe a reflex action, catching and then releasing the ball suggests he could have avoided it. I have to say 'God bless the Kiwis', because on the pitch they accepted it. They will talk to the referee after the game, but during matches they just get on with it. They set the standards. Jonathan Davies was very good and was the Lions players' man of the series but for me the best player in a red shirt was Taulupe Faletau. The Wales number eight was so consistent, and I believe there's even more to come. He's a phenomenal athlete with a fantastic engine, which allows him to always play for 80 minutes in both defence and attack. I'd still like to see more of him carrying in the wider channels, but he was my man of series. Rugby is such a squad game it's a shame you have to pick individuals but Taulupe is a bit of an unsung hero and his work-rate and ability mean he made a massive contribution. His Wales team-mate Davies had a fine series. He made some great breaks, he was solid in defence without being headline-making, he assumed the role of carrying to the gainline in the second and third Tests, came up with a couple of good relieving kicks and played well all round. Maro Itoje showed his growing maturity by the way he pushed the boundaries - he was knowingly offside and doing it for a reason, which is great when you get away with it. He was magnificent in the third Test and at one point made four tackles in about 45 seconds. His willingness to be involved is staggering and a benchmark for anyone who wants to be the best. Owen Farrell's mental ability to step back and kick crucial penalties, especially after he missed a couple of kicks early in the tour, shows his ability to totally zone in when he has to - something New Zealand's Beauden Barrett, for all his other abilities, doesn't seem able to do. O'Brien was also impactful on the flank and made sure the Lions were on the front foot both in attack and defence, and his Ireland team-mate Conor Murray was very good at the base, helping run the game. I hope this series is a springboard for the home unions to believe there can be a shift in power in terms of the world rankings and beating the southern hemisphere teams on a more regular basis. Let's get fitter and really test ourselves. I don't think many of the home unions can compete on skills in the forwards with New Zealand but the back three the Lions fielded was probably more skilful and adventurous than that of the hosts, which shows the possibilities are there. There was some talk going into the series that the future of the Lions was once again under threat and what's interesting is that the posturing is coming from the clubs. I would like to think they're clever enough to go and do the negotiations behind the scenes now because they must realise how secure the Lions' future is. Ask a player, coach or supporter if they think the Lions is here to stay and there will be a resounding yes. That says everything that needs to be said. Jerry was talking to BBC Sport's James Standley.	We have just witnessed a phenomenal Lions series.
Milkins' five losses in-a-row, saw the 40-year-old slip to 31st in the world rankings, but he ended his slump with a 6-1 win over Hamza Akbar. "I was under a lot of pressure because I just haven't won a match for ages. "That is such a weight off my shoulders winning that. I needed it money-wise and ranking-wise," Milkins said. The Gloucester potter, who plays Hammad Miah in the second round at the weekend, had his best run at the UK Championship in 2002 when he reached the quarter-finals. He added: "I feel like I am going to take off but because I haven't won a match it has been really difficult. When things aren't going they aren't going, but maybe that is just the win I needed. "I played alright. There weren't a lot of breaks but I didn't miss many balls. "I have been playing so well in practice and I think that practice has got me through a few frames because I was really sharp. "It's really tough when you are losing, any little thing can put you off. The last two or three matches I have lost because of my head and not because of how I have been playing. You get in a rut but I am out of it now."

Andrew Travers left the authority by "mutual agreement" after the error, officials said. Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list. An independent investigation has been launched, the council said. In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: "I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive." A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had "made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive." Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said. On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later. Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected. But voters in the area questioned how the result could be "fair" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box. A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems. The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee. It will look at the "appropriateness" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June. A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation.	The chief executive of Barnet Council has left his role after a blunder led to some voters being turned away from polling stations on Thursday.
It was unanimously passed by MPs in December, but Mr Koroma refused to sign it after protests by religious leaders. After consultations, MPs returned the bill to him last month, unaltered. The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks. Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent. "Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone," their letter said. The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides. President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution. Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum. When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies. Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says. The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party. Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they "represent a huge constituency across the country". Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: "No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred. "If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country," Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying. Our reporter says the recent Ebola outbreak exposed Sierra Leone's weak health system. The country is still recovering from a brutal 10-year civil war, which ended in 2002 and ravaged much of its infrastructure.	Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma has again refused to sign a bill legalising abortion, saying it should be put to a referendum.
In the last three weeks, blooms have appeared along the shoreline on Anglesey and there have been some reports of children being stung. The cold spring meant there were few reports of jellyfish before June. Frankie Hobrow from the Anglesey Sea Zoo advised swimmers to "look but don't touch" and to treat stings with vinegar. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane variety, have been seen by holidaymakers at Benllech beach, on the Menai Strait. Ms Hobrow said: "They have increased over the last two or three weeks with the warmer weather. They get carried around on the ocean currents, they can't swim very well so they rely on being carried around, and we do see this every year once it gets warmer. "The sea temperatures warm up slightly and we get a lot more swarms of jellyfish." Ms Hobrow said the Lion's Mane gives a "nasty sting". She said: "They can grow very, very big - over two metres - but the ones here are fairly small. "They can be painful but it's generally localised pain - it doesn't usually last very long. You can often help if you apply vinegar - that's great because it's acidic." She also said urine could also be used because of its acidity. The MCS's National Jellyfish Survey, which is in its 10th year, said 7,500 jellyfish reports have been made by the public over the last decade. Dr Peter Richardson, the charity's biodiversity programme manager, said: "The scarcity of jellyfish reports before June was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring. "However, as our waters warmed, sightings of jellyfish increased, with moon jellyfish reported in large numbers around the UK, reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the south west, and blooms of Lion's Mane jellies around north Wales and north west England."	The jellyfish population in north Wales has soared after the recent warm weather, researchers have said.

The star of TV series Dexter and Six Feet Under, Hall played the lead role in Bowie's musical Lazarus, which premiered shortly before his death. He will perform the title song, which opens with the line: "Look up here, I'm in heaven", and was widely interpreted as Bowie's personal epitaph. The song also appears on Bowie's Mercury-nominated Blackstar album. Other nominees include Laura Mvula, The 1975, Kano and Bat For Lashes. Radiohead are also shortlisted for their album A Moon Shaped Pool. It is their fifth nomination - but they have yet to win the Â£25,000 prize. The band, who are on a brief break from their world tour, are not expected to perform at the ceremony, but most of the other acts will appear. On the night, the 12 nominated albums will be cut down to six finalists, one of whom will be chosen by a public vote. A panel of judges, including Jarvis Cocker, Annie Mac and Wolf Alice frontwoman Ellie Rowsell, will then choose the overall winner.

David Skeen, 51, was last seen going for a run in Talgarth, near Brecon, at 09:00 GMT on Tuesday. Firefighters, police and more than 45 mountain rescue volunteers had been out searching for Mr Skeen. A drone was used during the day. Mr Skeen was last seen wearing an orange gilet, black running trousers, pale trainers and a blue hat. Dyfed-Powys Police said they would continue to follow up any lines of inquiry overnight.	The search for a jogger who has been missing for more than 24 hours in Powys has been stood down for the night.
About 300 have already died at Farewell Spit, on the South Island, in one of the worst such cases in the country. Hundreds of locals and conservation department staff have been trying to save the survivors since early Friday morning, and have formed a human chain to refloat the whales. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Sometimes when one whale is beached, it will send out a distress signal attracting other members of its pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. The conservation department said it had received a report about a possible stranding on Thursday night, but did not launch the rescue operation until Friday morning as it was too dangerous to attempt a rescue in the dark, reported the New Zealand Herald. Andrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand. New Zealand marine mammal charity Project Jonah. which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded. It said the surviving whales are "being kept cool, calm and comfortable" by medics and members of the public. Some of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles. She told news outlet Stuff that there were "so many fins in the air, no breathing". "We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad." "One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following," Ms Wiles added. New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to Project Jonah.. Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. In February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves at the same location, of which at least half died.	Volunteers in New Zealand are racing to rescue survivors after more than 400 pilot whales beached themselves.
His form is improving, he said. His game is coming together. Been coming for a while now, he stressed. Thursday was the confirmation of it;  two under par in testing conditions in the first round of the Scottish Open. First page of the leaderboard. Nice. The fact that McDowell shot 80 in the opening round in France last week - and then missed the cut - mattered not a jot. The fact that he's failed to make the weekend in 50% of the tournaments he's played in this year in his adopted home in America didn't soften his confidence. The Northern Irishman was upbeat. He called his season "really weird". You hear this a lot, this massaging of an ugly bottom line. 'I'm playing better than I'm scoring'. That's another mantra. 'I'm not far away, I can feel it clicking. Any week now, I promise. Any week now...' With McDowell the tendency is to accept what he's saying. He's only had two top 10 finishes in 2016 and is some distance out of the Ryder Cup reckoning, but you'll struggle to find somebody on tour who thinks he won't be at Hazeltine in September, one way or another. McDowell is not the only go-to Ryder Cup man of the past on the outside looking in at present. Lee Westwood would have to rely on a captain's pick if the team was settled tomorrow. So would Martin Kaymer. Ian Poulter is out injured. Others from two years ago are badly out of form. Of the 12 who won the Cup at Gleneagles, only four are in the team right now - Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose. All of this can change, of course, but these are interesting times in the race for the Ryder Cup nonetheless. The cavalry you see coming over golf's hilltop is largely led by the new generation. There are nine automatic slots in Darren Clarke's team and as it stands today, five of them are occupied by rookies. By contrast, the American team has eight automatic slots (plus four wild cards) and of the eight in pole position at the moment, only one of them - Brooks Koepka - is a rookie. Danny Willett, Masters champion, is one of the European five. Chris Wood, winner of the PGA championship at Wentworth in May, is another. Andy Sullivan, second in Dubai and fifth last weekend in France, is a third. Rafa Cabrera Bello, five top-eight finishes this year, is the fourth and Matt Fitzpatrick, seventh at the Masters and winner of the Nordea Masters, is the fifth rookie currently in the team. On Wednesday, Colin Montgomerie, the victorious European captain of 2010, said no team would want any more than five rookies. Montgomerie's side in Wales had six rookies in it, but he said that's not advisable. The last winning American team, Paul Azinger's 2008 side in Valhalla, also had six rookies. Three of them - Steve Stricker, Hunter Mahan and JB Holmes - were captain's picks. As part of a foursome, a fourball or in the Sunday singles, Azinger's rookies contributed 12 points in their team's 16½-12½ success. Anthony Kim's days at golf's top table might have been extraordinarily brief, but they were spectacular. At Valhalla, Kim was a revelation. Azinger didn't care that half his team hadn't played Ryder Cup before. He was fearless in going with form and he got his reward. Was Montgomerie making too much of the rookie argument? "That's Colin's opinion, but we want the best golfers," said Cabrera Bello. "I'm close, but I'm not done yet." Sullivan is also close. "I'm in at the moment but the next three or four weeks are going to be massive," he said. "We have the Scottish Open now and then The Open and the USPGA. Three big events.  If I don't get in automatically then I'm not getting a pick. I'm sure of that. I'm not playing for a pick, I'm playing for automatic qualification. "There's a lot of rookies there or thereabouts. I'm sure Darren wouldn't have wanted so many in the frame but we're trying to give him as big a headache as possible. There's quite a few of us trying to show that we're ready for it. Come Hazeltine, we'll see how many of us are there and if we're ready for it or not." McDowell is acutely aware of what he needs to do - or not do. "I'm trying my best to throttle back and be patient and not go grabbing for it," he said about his game and his pursuit of a spot on the team. He said that regardless of how many rookies are currently in the top nine, somebody like Shane Lowry would be a "hell of a pick". Lowry - second at the US Open in June - is one of those rookies who's banging on the door a little more loudly than some of the more established names. Thorbjorn Olesen has had four top 10s this year. Fellow Dane Soren Kjeldsen has three - including a top 10 at the Masters. Scotland's Russell Knox has had a win and two seconds since last autumn. Sullivan was probably right when he said that Clarke would be wishing for some experienced men to find themselves again - Westwood, Kaymer and McDowell most notably - but what if they don't? What's the thinking when you have an in-form rookie on the one hand and an out-of-sorts legend on the other? Does Clarke still go with experience? How many rookies is enough? How many is too many? "Darren wouldn't want us to make it easy for him," said Sullivan, with a smile. In the coming months, the captain is going to have some big calls to make.	Graeme McDowell was at the back of the 18th green at Castle Stuart talking about "the dangling carrot" that is September's Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in Minnesota.
Publicly, his business was business; but, for almost quarter of a century, he was at the centre of an extraordinary chain of events that ultimately led to the historic IRA ceasefire of 1994 and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. He did that by agreeing to becoming a top-secret contact between sworn enemies - the IRA and the British government. Mr Duddy was a key link - from the early 1970s to the early 1990s - between the Provisional IRA Army Council and the Secret Intelligence Service, acting on the orders of various British governments. He even hosted talks in his own living-room involving a top British spy and Martin McGuinness - talks that would ultimately pave the way for peace in Northern Ireland in the 1990s. Born on 10 June 1936, Mr Duddy spent his early adult life running a family fish and chip shop in Londonderry. His wife Margo worked behind the counter. She described it as a "meeting place, where everyone came and sat and chatted". Ironically, the beef burgers were delivered by a certain young van driver called Martin McGuinness. The same young militant republican would rise to the leadership of the IRA and one day - perhaps indirectly through Mr Duddy's peace efforts - become his country's deputy first minister. Mr McGuinness died in March. Mr Duddy's apprenticeship as intermediary came in the days before Bloody Sunday in 1972. He was asked by a friend, Frank Lagan - a fellow Catholic who happened to be Derry's police commander - to try to persuade the Provisional and Official IRA to remove their weapons from the Bogside. After some soul-searching, Mr Duddy made contact with both organisations and they agreed to the request, with the exception of a few weapons left behind by the Officials for so-called defensive purposes. Then came Bloody Sunday, when British paratroopers shot dead 13 civil rights marchers during an anti-internment demonstration in Derry on 30 January, 1972. A 14th died later. Many consider the events of that day a turning point in Northern Ireland, and Mr Duddy warned Frank Lagan that it would have catastrophic consequences. "We are going to have a war on our hands," he said. In the ensuing violence in 1972, 479 people were killed, the highest annual death toll in what was to become known as the Troubles. The scale of the violence only served to heighten Mr Duddy's determination to work towards peace - a goal it would take unsung heroes like him, and others, more than 20 years to achieve. In 1973, he was introduced to a British government official he knew as Michael Oatley, who was, in fact, a spy from the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), code-named "The Mountain-Climber". Mr Duddy was to become the messenger between the IRA and the British government, the secret back channel who would pass messages between the two sides and, eventually, arrange meetings between them. The process resulted in direct talks between the British and the IRA leadership in 1974-5, some of which took place in Mr Duddy's own home on Derry's Glen Road. The republican side included IRA chief-of-staff Seamus Twomey, senior Belfast IRA commander Billy McKee, and the then Sinn Féin President Ruairí Ó Brádaigh. During this time, the IRA declared a ceasefire, but it broke down in the face of loyalist violence and the talks ended. The process resumed during the IRA hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981, in which Bobby Sands and nine other prisoners died. Mr Duddy, once again, was the link between the IRA and the British government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Codenamed "Soon", Mr Duddy was a conduit for messages passed back and forth between the two sides. During this time, "Soon" used his contacts to arrange for leading republican Danny Morrison to visit the prisoners in Long Kesh, or The Maze. But the negotiations were fraught with difficulty, as well as a lack of trust on both sides. It would take 10 deaths before the fast was called off in October 1981. Days later, most of the prisoners' demands were met. Sinn Féin was to emerge as a growing political force in Northern Ireland, as republicans now began to use the ballot box and the Armalite hand in glove. In the early 1990s, Mr Duddy hosted talks at his home between Mr Oatley and the intelligence services, and the republican leadership including the late Mr McGuinness. Talking to the enemy had created the opportunity for peace and in 1994, after more than 3,000 deaths, the IRA declared a ceasefire. Mr Duddy's work as the secret peacemaker" was almost done - and the Good Friday peace agreement was signed four years later. According to Martin McGuinness, Mr Duddy's successful role in the peace process was so renowned it even reached Colombia. In 2014, Mr McGuinness said that when he met President Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian leader told him that when his government opened a back channel with the rebel group Farc, the negotiator was codenamed "Brendan". The peace process was not the only area in which Mr Duddy used his mediating skills. Between 1997 and 2002, he co-chaired talks, along with other members of Londonderry's business community, aimed at resolving tension around the city's Apprentice Boys parade. The event is now largely trouble-free. He was also a former independent member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Meanwhile, his business career thrived - the family firm, Duddy Group, has interests in property, bars, restaurants and hotels, including Derry's City Hotel and the Ramada Hotel in Portrush.	Brendan Duddy - a Londonderry businessman described as Northern Ireland's "secret peacemaker" - has died aged 80.
According to a committee in charge of policing the morality of Iran's football federation, Sosha Makani's outfit was deemed inappropriate and against Islamic values. However, committee chief Mahboub Afrasiabi said it was only rumours that Makani was suspended because of the style of his trousers and that the matter would be dealt with after Ramadan. The issue of Makani's "SpongeBob SquarePants" comes at a time when social media users in Iran have been voicing anger at what they see as the systematic targeting of public figures by the conservative establishment. In an apparent attempt to calm the atmosphere, Sadra Mohaqeq, an editor at reformist newspaper Shargh Daily, tweeted: "The extent of reaction and the government's dealing with an incident, such as Sosha's trousersâ€¦ is a direct result of its coverage across social media platforms." However in a sign of the strength of feeling, another Twitter user took issue, responding with: "What kind of analysis is this? You mean to say people should not oppose anything? That we no longer have the right to oppose anything? That we shouldn't even voice an opinion?" The public furore around the Makani case has caused a stir among the authorities who fear it could put the cultural integrity of the country in jeopardy. Observers have suggested that to the government, Makani's trousers represent a step towards individuals straying from conservative religious teachings of the clergy and how Islam should govern their daily lives. The goalkeeper's attire is only the latest example of personal expressions to have fallen foul of the establishment. Recently, Taraneh Alidoosti, a celebrated actress who displayed a feminist tattoo on her left arm, drew the ire of hardliners who called for her to be banned from the screens. That too followed the arrest of seven Iranian fashion models, who were charged with "promoting Western promiscuity". Six of them who were women had posted pictures of themselves without headscarves on Instagram. In a televised trial, one of the models, Elham Arab, emphasised that fame and beauty were universal desires but acknowledged there was a "price to be paid". The models were arrested as part of an ongoing operation against "loose hijab" - code for immodest dress. The head of Iran's cyber-crimes court said the campaign had been stepped up to "monitor the use of social media by the Western imperialist powers to change the Iranian-Islamic life-style of our nation". While on the face of it, the government's concern with a man's choice of trousers might appear an overreaction, in the bigger picture it can be seen as an attempt to perpetuate a policy imposed since the Islamic revolution of 1979. This was echoed by an Iranian Twitter user, Bahareh, who pointed out that women have been subjected to scrutiny for years. "Your silence for when they condemn girls for their hijab should prepare you for their inevitable harassment when it comes to the colour of men's trousers," she tweeted. The Iranian government has even gone as far as accusing US celebrity Kim Kardashian and the CEO of Instagram of using "un-Islamic" methods aimed at corrupting Iranian youth. The disconnect between the authorities and ordinary people over Makani's ban was summed up by respected Iranian sports reporter Pejman Rahbar. "The six-month ban has been issued by an institute called an 'Ethics Committee', a place that reminds one of an illusionary Utopia, governed by a fake mayor," he posted on Facebook. "Their views are reflected in their ruling; an institute that we are powerless to confront whilst Iranian footballs roll like little marbles in the hands of a few on top."	The story of an Iranian goalkeeper suspended for, reportedly, wearing trousers with a motif similar to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants raised eyebrows around the world - but the case highlights some of the tensions at play in the country.
The advert for its invisible deodorant range said "white is purity" across an image of a woman. It was posted on the firm's Facebook page, geographically aimed at its followers in the Middle East. Nivea accepted the post was "misleading". Many on social media complained the post was racist, but it was also widely-shared among alt-right users. The advert on the Nivea Facebook page (since deleted) was posted alongside the caption: "Keep it clean, keep it bright. Don't let anything ruin it." The post was directed at its audience in the Middle East, although the company has 19 million fans globally on its page. Many on social media complained about the post's racist connotations. But it was also picked up by alt-right social media accounts who trolled the Nivea account with comments, including of Hitler and Pepe the frog, who was branded a hate symbol last year. One alt-right account said: "#Nivea: the official moisturizer/anti-perspirant of the #AltRight." A spokesperson for Nivea's owners Beiersdorf said: "There have been concerns risen about ethnic discrimination due to a post about NIVEA Deodorant Invisible for Black & White on our NIVEA Middle East Facebook page. "We are deeply sorry to anyone who may take offense to this specific post. After realizing that the post is misleading, it was immediately withdrawn. "Diversity and equal opportunity are crucial values of NIVEA: The brand represents diversity, tolerance, and equal opportunity. "We value difference. Direct or indirect discrimination must be ruled out in all decisions by, and in all areas of our activities."	German skincare brand Nivea has apologised and removed an advert that was deemed discriminatory.
Some 563 were held or arrested by Port of Dover police officers last year - up from 148 in 2013, a BBC Radio Kent Freedom of Information request shows. The figures come days after dozens of migrants attempted to storm the Channel Tunnel's Calais terminal. The Home Office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The FoI shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at Dover - one of the main gateways to Britain - between January and April this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed "the Jungle II" near the Port of Calais. French aid workers have reported a "catastrophic" situation there. Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett, who recently visited Calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the Channel. He told Radio Kent: "They think it's a great place to be and (Britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the UK." Last week, Channel Tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the French side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board UK-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the Calais area was the "highest ever". Hauliers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a Home Office spokesman said 40,000 attempted illegal crossings of the Channel had been foiled last year. He added: "We are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern France and Belgium, including a Â£2m upgrade of detection technology, a Â£1m extension of dog searching capacity and Â£12m to reinforce security at Calais and other ports. "During the current period of disruption to cross-Channel services, Border Force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. "We have deployed additional Border Force staff and sniffer dogs in northern France as well as bolstering screening checks at Dover for both tourist and freight vehicles." The Port of Dover Police is a non-Home Office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, Dover Harbour Board. Port of Dover Police is not responsible for border security, which is down to the Border Agency and Kent Police frontier operations.	There has been a large increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained or arrested by police at Dover.
27 June 2016 Last updated at 16:41 BST Even though the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU, in Scotland most people voted to remain. Now, some people are saying that Scotland should get independence from the rest of the UK, so that it can join the EU again on its own. Naz has been in Scotland to see what kids there think.	One of the biggest questions to come out of the historic decision that the UK should leave the European Union is about the future of Scotland.
The video shows three men and three unveiled women dancing to the song on the streets and rooftops of Tehran. Police chief Hossein Sajedinia said the "vulgar clip" had "hurt public chastity", the ISNA news agency said. Iran's state-run TV broadcast a programme on Tuesday, apparently showing the men and women confessing on camera. A subtitled edition of the TV clip, posted on YouTube, identified the detainees as "actors" who claimed they were tricked into making the Happy video for an audition. By Ali HamedaniBBC Persian The young people in the video are students, film-makers and photographers. Their video appeared during the Persian New Year, at the end of March, and it was an instant hit on Iranian social media sites, inspiring several copies. It is just the latest example of young Iranians using the internet to challenge the restrictions on their everyday lives. In the past month, hundreds of Iranian women have been defying the rules requiring them to cover their heads in public, by sending photographs of themselves without headscarves, to a newly created Facebook site called "My Stealthy Freedom". Arash Sobhani, leader singer of the Iranian underground rock group Kiosk, who now lives in the US told BBC Persian that the Iranian authorities continuing attempts to crackdown on "un-Islamic" behaviour were not working. "They banned our music, broke our guitars, attacked our parties and stopped our concerts," he said. "But did we stop? No!" "They told me they are making a feature film and they had a permit for it," said one man in the video. "They said those things and they fooled me." Another young woman added: "They had promised us not to publish the video." According to some unconfirmed reports, a total of 13 people were arrested in connection with the video, but official sources have not confirmed the exact number of detainees. Williams, whose song was nominated for an Oscar earlier this year, has protested at the arrests. "It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness," the singer wrote on his Facebook page. Iran's president Hassan Rouhani also appeared to criticise the arrest. A unofficial twitter account, widely believed to be associated with the President, posted a comment he first made last year, saying: "#Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviours caused by joy." Under Iran's interpretation of Islamic law, women must cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothing meant to preserve their modesty. Patrols of so-called "morality police" regularly enforce standards of Islamic dress on Iran's streets. However, the rules are widely flouted. The internet is also heavily filtered in Iran, with the authorities blocking access to popular social networking sites. The "Happy we are from Tehran" video, originally posted in March, has now been seen more than 40,000 times. At the end of the clip, the credits read: "Happy was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face." Iranian journalist Golnaz Esfandiari tweeted in response to the arrests: "Iran [is] a country where being 'happy' is a crime. "Thousands of Iranians have been arrested in the past 35 years for being happy [and] partying." Arash Sobhani, leader singer of the Iranian underground rock group Kiosk, told the BBC's Persian service that attempts to suppress musicians were not working. "They banned our music, broke our guitars, attacked our parties and stopped our concerts," he said. "But did we stop? No!" Many Twitter users have begun using the hashtag #freehappyiranians to put pressure on the Iranian authorities to release those arrested over the video. Williams' song has inspired hundreds of tributes since it was released last year on the soundtrack to hit animation Despicable Me 2. The music video lasted an exhausting 24 hours - with dozens of people filmed lip-syncing and dancing to the feel-good anthem, which was played on a loop. The clip sparked a YouTube craze, with thousands fans around the world staging their own performances of the song. When shown a montage of the tributes on the Oprah Winfrey show last month, Williams began to cry, saying the response to the song had been "overwhelming". In the UK, the track has reached number one on three separate occasions, while in the US it spent 10 weeks at the top of the Hot 100.	A group of Iranian fans who created a tribute to Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy have been arrested.
A letter from an NHS England official to managers and GPs in one region suggests vulnerable practices could be left to "wither by the system". The note, seen by the BBC and Pulse magazine, claims NHS England is no longer able to "continue supporting practices irrespective of their ability… to transform appropriately". NHS England denied this was the case. A spokesman for the British Medical Association said it was "unacceptable" that some NHS managers believed that some GP practices would be left to close. A practice may be vulnerable due to: These are often practices rated by regulators as "inadequate" or "requiring improvement". It comes as media reports suggest much of a special fund to help struggling GP surgeries has not yet been handed out more than a year after it was unveiled. In June 2015, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a £10m investment in GP practices in England which were deemed to be vulnerable. This was formally launched by NHS England later in the year. But last week, the medical publication Pulse reported that barely any of the fund had reached GPs.  Managers administering the fund in each area were said to be still identifying which vulnerable practices would qualify for the support. NHS England did not deny the report, though a source said the organisation was "working through its local teams to ensure the funding available through the vulnerable practice programme is fully committed to named individual practices by the end of October". Around 800 out of a total of 8,000 practices are deemed by NHS England to be in the vulnerable category. The criteria include a high number of patients per GP and an "inadequate" or "requires improvement" rating by the regulator, the CQC. NHS chiefs said the aim was to provide support for practices under pressure and to ensure patients had continued access to high quality care. In April 2016, NHS England announced an extra £16m for this year for a so-called "practice resilience programme", with another £24m in subsequent years. This pool of money was also aimed at shoring up struggling practices and was part of the GP Practice Forward View unveiled by the head of NHS England Simon Stevens. But a letter sent by Paul Twomey, medical director of the NHS England North Yorkshire and Humber area team, to local GPs and health officials in August suggests a harder line stance. In it he says: "The message we need to communicate to general practice is the GP Practice Forward View must be about transformation and in that sense is not like a pilot." He goes on to express his belief that local health leaders will understand that "vulnerable practices must either transform and deliver a quality service or be allowed to fail and wither by the system. We are no longer in a position to continue supporting practices irrespective of their willingness or ability as a provider to transform appropriately." Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association's GP committee said this approach was unacceptable. He called on the government to deliver the funding immediately and "deter a mindset amongst managers that some GP practices can be allowed to disappear". An NHS England spokesperson said: "Rising patient demand is placing GPs under more pressure and that is why we are reversing the historic under-investment in general practice through a wide-ranging action plan, backed with half a billion pounds to support struggling practices. "This includes a four-year, £40m programme for helping the GP surgeries facing the most difficulties and further practical measures to stabilise general practice for the future." References to surgeries and practices being "allowed to fail" comes at a sensitive time in the debate about the state of NHS primary care in England. There has been a steady stream of surgery closures and recruitment problems. GPs complain of a growing and sometimes intolerable workload. Last month 2,000 patients were left without a GP after a surgery was closed in Nottingham following an "inadequate" regulatory rating. They were advised to contact other surgeries nearby. In July, an Oxfordshire doctor's surgery announced it would close because it claimed changes to the national GP contract made it "financially unviable" and two partners were due to retire. This week, a North Yorkshire practice said it would close in the New Year. NHS England, while promising to boost the share of the overall NHS budget going to general practice, has encouraged doctors to pool resources by forming "super-partnerships" and federations. Improving out-of-hours access and working more closely with community health services are also on the task list for GP groups. The underlying message is that more efficient ways of delivering care at a time of stretched resources are required. NHS chiefs are under pressure to find efficiency savings and a multitude of smaller practices might not be the best use of resources. But the danger is that a process of modernisation and consolidation involving surgery closures could leave patients in some areas unable to get a GP appointment.	Some struggling GP surgeries in England will be allowed to fail and close, according to a leaked document.
It was a "good opportunity" and "a chance to work together," a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put "in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent. Moroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975.

The animals were happily munching in the front garden of a house in Drummond Road close to its junction with the busier Culduthel Road. Police received calls from members of the public who were both concerned for the sheep and seeking to reunite the animals with their owner. Officers helped to have the sheep rounded up and returned to their home. It is understood the animals are kept locally.	Police have been called to deal with a small flock of sheep loose near Inverness city centre.
The 37-year-old midfielder announced his decision after playing the whole match as Greece lost on penalties in the last-16 tie against Costa Rica. "This was my last game for Greece," said Karagounis. Media playback is not supported on this device "We wanted to stay in Brazil another week or even longer but you can't change it now." Karagounis made his international debut in 1999 and amassed a record 139 caps for his country, scoring 10 goals in the process. He helped Greece win Euro 2004 and their progress in Brazil meant they reached the second round of the World Cup for the first time in their history. Karagounis, who was released by Fulham at the end of last season, said he was making way for Greece's next generation of players. "The national team has grown up, younger players have won invaluable experiences," he added. "This is no small thing and as we helped the team come of age we hope it will continue to be as successful in the future." Greece coach Fernando Santos will also leave his post after his contract expired on Monday. Santos was sent to the stands before the penalty shootout took place against Costa Rica and had to watch on television as his side made their exit from the World Cup.

Shopkeeper Alice Wheeldon was found guilty of a poison plot against David Lloyd George in 1917. Since her death in 1919, a campaign has emerged to clear her name. Her former home at 12 Pear Tree Road, Normanton, is being marked with a plaque in a ceremony organised by Derby Civic Society and the city council. Keith Venables, from the Derby People's History group, which campaigned for justice for the family, said: "It's wonderful to celebrate the contribution of Alice Wheeldon and her family. Their name was vilified." Mrs Wheeldon, a mother of four, supported the suffragette movement and was a conscientious objector to World War I. Mr Venables believes she was framed by the authorities who were anxious about opposition to the war. The radical women who fought for the vote The family claimed an MI5 agent, posing as an objector, embroiled Mrs Wheeldon in a plot to poison dogs guarding prisoners against the war. However, the family were accused of plotting to murder the prime minister by shooting him with poisoned darts. On 31 January 1917, Mrs Wheeldon, her daughters Hetty and Winnie and son-in-law Alfred Mason were arrested and charged. Mrs Wheeldon was sentenced to 10 years, Alfred seven years and Winnie five years. Hetty was acquitted. Mrs Wheeldon went on a hunger strike and was released after nine months but died shortly afterwards. Historian Dr Nicholas Hiley, who researched the family's story, said: "The whole thing was a travesty. "The truth about Alice Wheeldon deserves to be publicised and the blue plaque is the beginning of that. The Wheeldons should be honoured and remembered for the stand they took during the war." Mrs Wheeldon's descendents moved to Australia, but her great-granddaughters, Deirdre and Chloe Mason, are visiting Derby for the ceremony. They hope to prepare a miscarriage of justice application to go before the Criminal Cases Review Commission.	A Derby suffragette, who was convicted of attempting to murder a prime minister, is being honoured with a blue plaque.
Wales was around 40th out of 68 in the last Pisa international school test results for science, maths and reading released last December. Wales also fell behind the rest of the UK with an average score of 468. Mr Lewis has set a new target score of 500. Conservatives said that amounted to "stagnation" not "aspiration". As a comparison, Scotland scored over 500 points last year, which means that the new target for Wales in 2021 would put it on a par with Scotland in 2013. Mr Lewis had told BBC Wales last December that ditching the target was the easy way out and he did not want to lower pupils' ambitions. On Thursday he insisted the new approach was still ambitious. "This is a better target, I think, because it relates to what teachers can aim for in their classrooms, in their schools, as regards the actual progress of young people," he said. "If we say to a head teacher 'we need to be in the top 20', it's very difficult to translate that into how their 15-year-olds should do at GCSE. "But if we say 'score 500' they can measure their progress towards it." Conservative shadow education minister Angela Burns ridiculed Labour for seeking to "raise Welsh performance from the worst performing UK nation to the second worst by 2021". "This isn't aspiration, but stagnation," she said. "This feeble new target shows a poverty of ambition for young people." But the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said it was "pleased" the minister was taking the "sensible approach". Owen Hathway, of NUT Wales, said: "It was always a little unwise to have created such targets simply for the headlines they drew. "Evaluating the progress of the points scored is a far better and more productive way of measuring progress." Plaid Cymru education spokesman Simon Thomas said he was "glad" Mr Lewis had now "placed more realistic expectations on the teaching profession". However Aled Roberts, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on education, called on ministers to "make up their minds once and for all about their education strategy or hold up their hands up and admit they don't know how to fix our education system". The new target was announced as part of an education improvement plan launched by Mr Lewis. Qualified for Life sets out the Welsh government's vision for education up to 2020, with the ambition that every learner in Wales should benefit from "excellent teaching and learning". An annual "report card" will show how Welsh education performs against a range of measurable targets.	The target to put Wales into the top 20 best-performing countries in education by next year has been scrapped by Education Minister Huw Lewis.
Yorkshire Water said the problem was detected at water treatment works at Tophill Low and Keldgate. A spokesman said the issue had now been resolved but it could take several hours for water supplies to return to normal. The HU7 and HU8 postcodes were particularly affected by the problem, along with other places in the city. Tens of thousands of residents could be affected, but the exact figure will not be known until an investigation has been carried out. Yorkshire Water said: "We apologise for the inconvenience caused this morning and hope to get the issue resolved and the water supply back to normal by the end of the day."	Thousands of homes in Hull have been left without water due to a technical fault.
Just days after dropping a supreme court action, the twins filed a fresh lawsuit against the company. It claims that Facebook "intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence" during their previous litigation. Originally, Tyler and Cameron accused Mr Zuckerberg of stealing their idea to create the site. The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film "The Social Network". The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard. He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world. A court case over who did what was resolved in 2008 when the parties agreed on a financial settlement, reportedly worth around $65m (Â£41m). In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement. The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue. In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings. The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard. Facebook's outside counsel Neel Chatterjee said in a statement: "These are old and baseless allegations that have been considered and rejected previously by the courts."	The Winklevoss brothers have re-started their long-running legal dispute with Facebook and its boss Mark Zuckerberg.
Jamie Spendiff's attack on Craig Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV. Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with a co-accused after killing the married 36-year-old last August. Spendiff, 26, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing in July. In CCTV footage shown to the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Logie could be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault. Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: "Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter." The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August. Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head. He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others. Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street. The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines. Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument. After patrons left the pub, a general melee broke out which ended with the fatal blow to Mr Logie. Mr Brown said: "Spendiff punched the deceased, who again had his arms up and out to the side, once on the face with force causing him to collapse to the ground. "He swung another punch at the deceased as he fell but missed. "With the deceased now on the ground Spendiff initially moved away before returning and danced round the deceased, at all times being moved away by the accused McCarthy and at one stage a female passer-by." Mark Stewart QC, for Spendiff, said the killer had expressed his sorrow for the victim and his family. Judge Lady Stacey remanded both accused in custody, saying the culpable homicide charge had "led to tragic consequences and a man has lost his life".	A man danced around his fallen victim after delivering a fatal blow during a street attack in Stirling, a court heard.
Investigations are continuing into why the vehicle ploughed into Catherine Bonner's flat in Main Road, Fairlie, at about 13:45 on Thursday. The A78 through the village is expected to remain closed until early next week. A 55-year-old man who also lived in the flats continues to be treated for minor injuries at Inverclyde Royal Hospital. He and the driver were rescued by the emergency services from the rubble. The 54-year-old driver has been released after treatment. The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash. North Ayrshire Council said it was working with contractors and engineers to ensure that the properties affected "are made safe". "Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe," the council said in a statement. "The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary. "It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week." The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing. The statement added: "The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused." Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area. It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station. Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: "While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road. "A draft version of the North Ayrshire Local Plan, published in 2003, called on the (then) Scottish Executive to 'fully assess the need for further improvements on the trunk road network and bring forward schemes at the earliest possible date for the A78 coastal route'. "While the specific reference to a Fairlie by-pass was removed at the request of the Scottish Executive's reporter, the council's aspiration for improvement schemes along the A78 coastal route remains."	Work will continue through the night to make safe the site of a house struck by a lorry in an accident that led to the death of a 55-year-old woman.
The home side went in at half-time a goal to the good after Bradley Dack headed home a Paul Konchesky cross. Charlton's Ricky Holmes saw a second-half penalty saved by Stuart Nelson, who had replaced the injured Jonathan Bond on the half-hour mark, but the Gills stopper could do nothing about Ajose's spot-kick a minute into time added on. Dack saw Charlton goalkeeper Declan Rudd race out to block a 25th-minute shot before he looped a header home for the opening goal five minutes before half-time. Charlton were much improved after the break but could not find a way past Nelson, who tipped a Josh Magennis header over before denying Holmes from 12 yards after Ryan Jackson had pulled down Fredrik Ulvestad. But in injury time Gillingham's Chris Herd handled in the area and half-time substitute Ajose stepped up to fire the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.

Former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville explains what Louis van Gaal has learned from his first season in the Premier League and why his team are not far away from being title contenders again. This season, they have dropped points in 10 out of their 16 away games against teams below them in the table. They got rolled over at Everton and Leicester, and drew with Burnley, Sunderland and West Brom. In the past, the aim at United was always to do the double over everybody outside the top six. We approached all of those games - home or away - with the aim of winning them and doing that was one of our strengths down the years. That meant, when we came up against our rivals in the top five, our record against the rest meant that those big games were not must-win and the pressure was off us a bit. This season, it has largely been the opposite. United have produced their best football against the other teams in the top five and have struggled against the sides that have camped in their own half and made things difficult for them. Going forward, United need a player who can make the difference in those games, when the opposition are packing their defence. Chelsea have that with Eden Hazard. Last season, Luis Suarez did it for Liverpool. Those players can win you the title because, when games are tight, they make the difference. But at the moment United do not have anyone who is providing those bits of individual brilliance in the final third. A lot of people are saying Gareth Bale would be the answer to that particular problem but I think United already have the right player on their books - if he performs to his capabilities. Angel Di Maria arrived for a British record fee last summer but, considering his £59.7m price-tag and his reputation, he has not delivered since his first three or four games. Even so, he is still the United player who excites me the most. Everything about the way he plays from his pace, his skill, and his ability running or passing forwards tells me he has what it takes to shine at Old Trafford. He has just not done it yet. Next season could be the time when he realises what it takes. He now knows there are no easy games in the Premier League, and that he has to toughen himself up. Di Maria will also understand that United are a huge club. He is on a big stage and there is a bit of pressure on him. We know he can do much better, and so will he. I would love to see him play to his potential because he could be the attacking star this United team needs to make the next step. Van Gaal's first season as United manager is also almost over and he will have found out a lot about English football over the last few months. Earlier in the campaign, he tried playing three at the back and I don't think that system worked for United. Van Gaal probably tried it because he was trying to accommodate Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the same team, but he has realised that he can't do that in the Premier League. When he arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might have under-estimated that anyone can beat anyone in this country. Maybe in some of the countries where he has managed in the past, teams in the bottom half of the table do not even give you a contest. Here, they do. At times Van Gaal has probably been surprised by the intensity of every game that United have played, but he will have learned from it too. Next season, he will come back and be thinking 'I know what I need to do'. Van Gaal has achieved his aim for his first year at United by securing a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League. Because of that, it has been a good season for him. Now his next target is to win the title, and I don't think United are far away from being champions again. The important thing is that they are going in the right direction. To go from seventh, where they finished last season, to first was always going to be impossible. People might say that is defeatist and not the way United should think but you cannot make that leap, even by spending £150m like United did last summer. You have to do it gradually. Going from seventh to fourth then first is achievable, although it clearly will not be easy. Can they do it? If David De Gea leaves, then that would be a big blow. Without him in goal, I don't think they would have finished in the top four this time. I am worried he will go because he has not signed a new contract and the noises coming out of the club about his future are not good, particularly if Real Madrid do come calling. Along with Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young and Juan Mata, De Gea's individual form has been one of the high points of the season. But it was United's sensational team performance in their win over Liverpool in March that was the most encouraging thing for the future. For me, it was their performance of the season and the one that gives me massive hope for what they can achieve next season. In fact, that period in March and April where they also beat Tottenham and Manchester City gave us a glimpse of what this team can do. That is the level that they have to play at consistently to challenge for the title. They could not do it this time but, just as with Van Gaal, a lot of United players will be better for what has happened to them in the last few months. I am expecting further improvement from them too. Phil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.	I think Manchester United can be Chelsea's closest challengers for the title next season, but Louis Van Gaal has got to get things right away from home against the so-called lesser teams.
At a Buckingham Palace garden party in pouring rain on Tuesday, the Queen commented, "Oh, bad luck"  when told a Metropolitan Police commander had led the police operation around the Chinese leader's visit. The Queen's unguarded comments are atypical for her, but also pose some unanswered questions about the visit. In short, we don't know. Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was "seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen. Commander D'Orsi said it "was quite a testing time" and that "they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off". The Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: "They were very rude to the ambassador." "They walked out on both of us," replied Ms D'Orsi. Did Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary? Was any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance? We simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement. President Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details. The Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015. Commander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was "working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest". The Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman His footage was released to broadcasters under the "pool" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement). It was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted. Indeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a "new height". Buckingham Palace would not comment on a "private conversation" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and "marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK". We now know, thanks to the Queen's comments, that it was a testing time behind the scenes, at least for the police commander and the British ambassador to China. However, that does not mean that overall the trip was not a success. Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, and a former senior British diplomat in Beijing, told the BBC that it was striking that even someone with the Queen's six decades of diplomatic experience still found dealing with the Chinese protocols and machinery tough: "In terms of the atmospherics between diplomats in China and the UK, it's not an easy relationship and that comes through in the freight of emotion that was in her comments." At the moment, there is no coverage whatsoever of this in mainland China, says BBC Monitoring's China Media Analyst Kerry Allen. "This is not unusual. The comments the Queen made will be regarded as highly embarrassing by China's elite, as the concept of 'maintaining face' - one's sense of dignity or prestige - is incredibly important within the country," she says. "Owing to the sensitivity of her comments, state media will be required to hold off covering this until the government decides what official response to give. "Some users of popular microblogs like Sina Weibo though are commenting on it and quickly gaining responses. However, the censors are catching up and censoring comments to limit impact." The BBC's World News TV channel goes temporarily to black in China whenever the story about Mr Xi's visit is mentioned. Probably not.	The Queen has described Chinese officials as having been "very rude" during last October's state visit to the UK by President Xi Jinping.
Arlene Foster was speaking after a meeting of the executive on Thursday afternoon. She told the BBC there were no solutions on the table. The Stormont parties failed to pass the Welfare Reform Bill on Tuesday. Mrs Foster said failure to pass the legislation meant that there was a £600m hole in her budget. She said she cannot move the budget bill required to give Stormont officials the legal authority to carry on spending money after the end of July. The minister said she is seeking a meeting with the Treasury in London early next week to assess her options. Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd said Stormont ministers should present a united front and seek a joint meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron. However, both the Alliance Party and Ulster Unionist ministers said they were pessimistic about the chances of a resolution to the executive's difficulties.	The finance minister has said she cannot move the budget bill forward because of the inability of the Stormont parties to resolve the deadlock over welfare reform.
The Reid Building sits facing Rennie Mackintosh's famous 1909 landmark. Designed by US architect Steven Holl, the new Â£30m building - which is part of a Â£50m project - replaces a 1970s concrete tower block. It will bring the departments of design together under one roof, along with a new lecture theatre, workshops, canteen and staff offices. Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a 28-year-old junior draughtsman at a Glasgow architecture firm when he drew up the designs for the building that many consider his masterpiece. The dramatic art nouveau design of the Glasgow School of Art building in the Garnethill area of the city centre took another 12 years to be completed, finally opening in 1909, but it heralded the birth of a new style in 20th Century European architecture. It is now considered one of Scotland's most admired and influential buildings and Mackintosh, under-appreciated in his own time, is lauded as one of the country's finest designers. The task of designing a 21st Century building to sit on the opposite side of Renfrew Street to Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece went to Steven Holl, along with local practice JM Architects. Its design has proved controversial, with The Architectural Heritage Society for Scotland branding it "alien" and questioning the "use of large unrelieved stretches of grey opaque glass". New York-based Holl, 66, won the 2010 competition to design new 11,000 sq ft accommodation for the art school's design department. The building, which will house about 800 students, is named in honour of the art school's former director, Seona Reid. It extends for the same length as its illustrious neighbour, so the temptation to compare them is very great. Holl has described his approach as "complementary contrast". He said he wanted to do the opposite of everything Mackintosh did. Whereas Mackintosh has thick sandstone, Holl has developed a thin skin entirely of glass, which he hopes will pick up the light. Mackintosh worked with detail and ornament and Holl uses modern techniques of glass-making. Inside studios and social spaces have large areas of unobstructed window. As well as that, translucent glass has been extended over all external walls and forms a second layer to a number of windows. Famous Glasgow School of Art graduates includes Dr Who actor Peter Capaldi and Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane, as well as novelist and muralist Alasdair Gray. Artist Peter Howson and Scotland's national poet Liz Lochhead attended the school as well as Fran Healy and Dougie Payne from Glasgow band Travis and members of Franz Ferdinand. In recent years, Glasgow School of Art has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon and David Shrigley and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011.	The new Glasgow School of Art building is being officially opened across the road from Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece.
Chris May, 28, was last seen at his home in Kelvedon, Essex, on 25 May. His Volkswagen Golf was found abandoned in the village of Fairstead, according to Essex Police. Police received a letter in June, sent in the post, saying Mr May was dead. Charity Missing People is now advertising Mr May's case nationally. Det Ch Insp Marina Ericson said: "I am really grateful for all the assistance Missing People have given to us and this national advertising will mean we can reach a wider audience with the appeal for information about Chris's whereabouts. "Since Chris went missing in May, I have been appealing for anyone with information to come forward. "There will be someone out there who knows something but, for whatever reason, has not come forward so far. "I made an appeal in June for the author of a letter, delivered by Royal Mail to Witham police station on 1 June, to contact me. "To date that person has not made contact. I would like to appeal to them to make contact with me directly."	Police investigating the disappearance of a man three months ago say they have yet to trace the sender of a letter claiming he was dead.
Patrick McGinley, 46, and his son William McGinley, 27, of Lisfarrell, Edgeworthstown, County Longford are accused of murdering Bernard McGinley. He was shot dead outside a wedding in Newtownbutler in February. The two men are to be released on conditions including a Â£50,000 cash surety and daily reports to police. The court was told the weapon used in the shooting in February 2015 has not been recovered	The Public Prosecution Service has lost an appeal against the granting of bail for two men charged with murdering a relative at a wedding in Fermanagh.
Lynn Davies, 58, from Neath, was given a deal by Cardiff Crown Court judge Patrick Curran QC in October and given six months to repay the cash. The court heard on Friday Davies had paid up before the deadline and his jail term was suspended for two years. He charged victims £500 on top of every £1,000 borrowed and loaned £23,395 over seven years, pocketing £33,425. Davies, who threatened his victims if they did not pay, was caught out after an anonymous tip-off to the Wales Illegal Money Leading Unit. Davies previously said he did not have the funds to pay back his five victims but has since repaid the profit he made, which waa almost £10,000. Prosecutor Timothy Evans told Cardiff Crown Court: "The money has been paid into a bank account. Where it has come from is a matter to him, but his victims have their money back." Davies told one of his victims he would "smash her partner's head in" if she failed to meet his demands. Father-of-one Davies, who lives in Melyn, previously pleaded guilty to two counts of unlicensed money lending. Judge Patrick Curran QC said: "If the money was repaid, the court would consider suspending your sentence and I have been told that you have paid the money. "The law is in place to protect the weak from people such as you. "This sort of activity exploits the vulnerable and draws people deeper and deeper into debt."	A loan shark has taken a judge's offer to avoid an 18-month prison sentence by repaying his victims.
The 22-year-old fractured her neck and back, dislocated her pelvis and slipped a disc in her neck after colliding with Elis Ligtlee during the omnium final. Norfolk's Williamson spent four weeks in hospital after January's accident. "They were pretty sure paralysis was going to be the outcome while I was in Rotterdam, but luckily I pulled through," she told BBC Look East. "Being an athlete, I think they said because my neck and back were so strong I was able to withstand the force. "Although I did break a few bones, my spinal cord stayed intact and I'm here to live another day." Racing at the event was cancelled after the 2013 World Championships bronze medallist's crash, with fans asked to leave the velodrome. "I have no memories, which is probably pretty good," she said. "It's not going to put me off in the future," she said. "I remember holding onto the fence getting ready to roll up to the final and then next thing I know I was in hospital and someone was telling me I'd had an accident. I just responded with 'did I win?'. That was all I was worried about." Williamson hopes to be back "easy riding" on a bike by the end of the summer and says she has the right support around her to make a full recovery. Media playback is not supported on this device "I'm going to get back on a bike eventually," she added. "I've got no timescale yet, but I don't know what level I'll be able to get to. I'll give it a good go. "I've got the full support team behind me, I've got physios, doctors. We've got the world's best. At the end of the day, we're a great programme, so I've got every chance of getting back to where I was."	Britain's Victoria Williamson says she is lucky not to be paralysed after her serious crash at Rotterdam's Zesdaagse.
The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks "threatened internet safety". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. "The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety," the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read "Do you have a conscience?".	The Chinese government is cracking down on home-grown cyber thieves seeking to steal online banking details.
The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported. However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour. The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations. On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human. Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal. Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's  science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013. Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia. Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper. The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test. The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies. Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science. The event has been labelled as "historic" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before. "Some will claim that the Test has already been passed," said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University. "The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. "A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday." Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: "It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments." But others have criticised the claim. "It's nonsense," Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. "We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close." Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes. "That's scarcely very penetrating," he told the Huffington Post, noting that Eugene had previously been ranked behind seven other systems in his own 25-minute long Loebner Prize test.	A computer program called Eugene Goostman, which simulates a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, is said to have passed the Turing test at an event organised by the University of Reading.
Membership of the Labour Party has soared since the general election and Mr Corbyn believes most of these new members are his supporters. The hope of his opponents is that many may have become disillusioned with his leadership. But having spent a day in Leeds meeting new and older members of the local party, I found scant evidence for this. If anything, Mr Corbyn's supporters seem ever more determined to defend him. So who are these new members; the so called "Corbynistas"? I spent time with four of them: Jane Ingham , 65, a retired head teacher, Ged Colgan, 26, a hotel worker, Marvina Newton, 30, a local charity manager and Jane Aitchison, who is in her 40s and is a trade unionist. What quickly became clear was that, not only was Jeremy Corbyn the main reason they joined the Labour Party, but they remain fiercely loyal to him. Mr Corbyn, they believe, offers inspiration and change.  In the past Labour had become too similar to the Conservatives; particularly over austerity, they say. Jeremy Corbyn represented a break with the traditional way of doing politics "He's unlike anyone," says Marvina. "To me that's what is great about him. He speaks from the heart. " What was also clear was the disdain all four had for those Labour MPs seemingly determined to oppose Jeremy Corbyn. "Unfortunately they have been part of a style of politics that has not only failed to win elections but they have been consistently wrong about a whole range of issues," says Ged. Jane the retired head teacher is similarly unimpressed. "I'm quite disappointed with the MPs. Do too many of them have too many privileges and just enjoy the privilege of being members of Parliament?" And there's no disguising the fact these new members are prepared for a fight should Labour MPs continue to refuse to back Mr Corbyn, if he wins this leadership contest. No-one mentions the D-word, deselection. But the warning signs are clear. "It's perfectly legitimate for local members to choose who they want to be their candidate at the next election," warns Ged. "I don't see why being an MP should be treated like a job for life." Jane, the trade unionist, agrees. "They (the MPs) do feel threatened. We represent change and Jeremy represents huge change and that threatens their very cosy position." So what of longer-serving party members? How do they view this influx of pro-Corbyn new members ? Away from the city centre in one of Leeds' more deprived areas, Seacroft, a rock-solid Labour area, I met up with two long-standing party members: Les Wrigglesworth, a former miner, and Melvyn Burton. They both praise the energy and enthusiasm of the new recruits. However they are more cautious over how committed these new members will remain to the Labour Party. Les says they may prove "fair weather" members. They are both dismissive, however, of claims that many of the new members are so-called "entryists" from Trotskyite and other hard-left groups. Les dismisses the idea as a "red herring". There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority. Melvyn believes the new members may be "naive" in their views but they are not Trotskyists. It's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership. Some regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party. The difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point. Many Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party. But if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds.	There's no disguising the confidence in Jeremy Corbyn's camp about this leadership election.
Thomas Jackson, 30, of Congleton, Cheshire, was injured as he tried to help Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, in the attack at a hostel last week. Frenchman Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with murdering Ms Ayliffe-Chung and attempting to murder Mr Jackson. Police said this charge would be changed to murder. Latest updates on backpacker's death Mr Jackson's father Les said: "We are bereft. Our darling Tom has left us and the world is a poorer place. "There is dark and evil in this world perpetrated by a few, but so much more love and light emanates from so many more. That thought will sustain us over the coming days." The backpacker suffered head injuries as he went to the aid of Ms Ayliffe-Chung, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Police described his actions as "selfless". A spokesman for Queensland Police said Mr Jackson died in the Townsville Hospital. Investigations are continuing, but detectives will upgrade the charge to murder when Mr Ayad next appears at Townsville Magistrates' Court on October 28, he added. Mr Ayad is alleged to have stabbed Ms Ayliffe-Chung and to have caused the injuries which led to Mr Jackson's death at the Shelley's Backpackers accommodation in Home Hill on 23 August, at about 23:15 local time. Twelve police officers were also injured. Police previously said they were investigating whether Mr Ayad had an "obsession" with Ms Ayliffe-Chung. Mr Jackson's family said they were "immensely proud" of him for his actions. "There are many and varied reasons why we are, and always will be, immensely proud of Tom," his father said. "His actions in response to this horrific attack only add to that sense of pride." Mr Jackson's sister, Liv, wrote on Facebook: "There is nothing in this world that can prepare you for the pain and heartbreak of losing a sibling and a friend, but there is great comfort in knowing that he was mine. "All that I ask is that you don't remember Tom as a victim. "Indescribably proud of everything you accomplished and the lives you touched. I will love you always and forever TJ, your little sister, Lou." Rachel Edwards, 30, from Crewe, Cheshire, who has been close friends with Mr Jackson since they studied at South Cheshire College together, said there would "never be another one like him". She said: "He would literally try his utmost to try and light people's lives up with his kind words and inspiration, always pointing out the best in you." A fundraising page set up by Mr Jackson's friend Shoshana Palatnik has reached half of its Â£10,000 target to help his family. Ms Palatnik initially set up the Youcaring fundraising page for medical costs while Mr Jackson was on life support.	A "selfless" backpacker who was injured trying to save another traveller as she was stabbed to death in Australia has died, police in Queensland have said.
In the Victorian fairground where the grotesque mixed with the gaudy, where the sound of the barrel organ mixed with the whooshes and bangs of the various rides, there would be the stand where you would be able to lace up a pair of boxing gloves and take on the gnarled and grizzled man mountain who would be waiting for you in the ring. And the crowd would "ooh" and "aah" as the prizefighter set about you, raining blows down above and below the belt. And so it was in the beautiful Simi Hills in California last night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library that the Republican candidates took it in turn to try to give Donald Trump a bloody nose, a cracked rib, a thick lip and black eye. Ideally all four at once. First up, flexing his muscles, and jabbing hard, was Senator Rand Paul on whether Trump had the character to have his hand on the nuclear trigger. "I'm very concerned about him - having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his - his visceral response to attack people on their appearance - short, tall, fat, ugly - my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that?" Good shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - "I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there," said Trump. Cue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. "Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House." But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back "in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that." Jake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say "roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?" But he didn't need to. They were lining up. Hold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did. The former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance. He told Rolling Stone  - "Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" She was stoic and measured: "I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said." And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. "I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman." Her face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment. And "low energy" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate. Trump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited. There was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point. But he saw tonight that his opponents are prepared to fight back. And so the circus moves on. So roll up next time to see whether the polls change, whether all those candidates can stay the course. Thrills and spills await us.	The BBC's Jon Sopel sees presidential hopeful Donald Trump roll with the punches in the second Republican debate in California - until a new competitor entered the ring.
The area's MP Brendan O'Hara is hosting a reception detailing plans for the former Nato base at Machrihanish to be the centre of space tourism in the UK. Machrihanish is among five sites across Britain - three of which are in Scotland - hoping to be a spaceport. The UK government has previously said it wanted to establish a spaceport by the end of 2018. It launched a consultation in 2014 and two years ago it drew up a shortlist of potential sites. These also included Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Newquay airport in Cornwall and Llanbedr airport in the Snowdonia National Park. In May last year, the government included plans for spaceport licensing in its Queen's Speech. It also opened up the competition in favour of an airport-style licensing system, meaning any suitable location could become a spaceport. The Department for Transport said this would help create "viable business models at a range of locations". This meant that Prestwick and Campbeltown are both vying to attract investment to prove they are "best-placed" to become the UK's first operational spaceport. Ministers said any future spaceport would be used as a base for space travel and tourism, as well as satellite launches. The Machrihanish base, near Campbeltown, has twice been approved for space flight and was a certified emergency landing site in Europe ahead of a launch of the NASA Space Shuttle in 1981. Tom Millar, chairman of DiscoverSpace UK and the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company, said the local community was behind the bid and the potential economic benefits it could bring. He added: "Our site offers enormous scope with a runway of more than 3,000 metres and large areas of land available for development, allied to a positive and supportive planning framework put in place by Argyll and Bute Council. "Our safety case is very strong as the site is in a depopulated area and offers the ability to launch directly over the sea." Brendan O'Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll and Bute, said basing the spaceport in Kintyre was a "no-brainer". He added: "A spaceport would bring important economic benefits to Argyll and Bute and it is a hugely exciting prospect for Scotland to be at the forefront of space travel in the UK. The sky is not the limit."	Plans for the UK's first spaceport on the Kintyre peninsula are being unveiled at Westminster.
As in much of the West Indies, cricket here is a much-loved national sport. But something's a little different about this match. Instead of pitching the ball, the batsman rolls it across the grass to the waiting batsman, who is kneeling on the ground - primed for action. Bat meets ball with a satisfying whack and a cheer erupts from the small group. Welcome to a training session of the Guyana Blind Cricket Association. "It's not that different from sighted cricket," says top player and board member Ganesh Singh, who has been blind since he lost his sight at the age of 17. "In sighted cricket it's all about eye and hand co-ordination, here it's ear and hand co-ordination. "Once you're a keen listener, you pick up the line of the ball and then you can bowl, field and bat effectively. It's very instinctive." Instead of the traditional leather-and-cork model, blind cricket uses a hollow plastic ball filled with iron beads that rattle as the ball moves, alerting players to its location. "It's a very vocal game," explains Singh. "For example, if the bowler is totally blind, the keeper will make some kind of noise behind the stumps so that the bowler can get his direction and know where to bowl the ball. There's a lot of chatter and noise." Today the chatter is particular loud, as the team excitedly wait to hear who has been picked to play at the Regional Blind Cricket T20 championship in Trinidad. Schemona Trinidad, who has travelled two hours from Berbice to get to the stadium - located just outside the capital, Georgetown - is not certain she will make the cut. "I'm not absolutely sure. But I hope so!" she says. The 21-year-old joined the team in the B2 (or partially sighted) category but a deterioration in her vision means she's moved to B1, the category for blind players. "When I started, I could see the ball a little bit, now it's a bit more challenging," she says. But the friendly, banter-filled atmosphere makes playing less daunting. "When you're out there, you have to have confidence in yourself. "Some totally blind people that have just started to play are afraid to run around without a guide, but the coach and other team members are like 'Go for it! Chase the ball!' so that helps." One of four female players on the team, Trinidad is determined to reach the top. "I've heard that they're going to have a female [blind cricket] West Indies team from next year," she says excitedly. Given that the West Indies recently won its first Women's World Twenty20 in April, the timing could not be better. Trinidad is not the only one to wax lyrical about the game and its off-pitch benefits. "Blind cricket basically helped me to transform my life from being someone who was isolated from society, lacked self-esteem and confidence, to someone that is fully empowered," enthuses Singh. In 2006, he and two other Guyanese cricketers, Oliver Kerr and Patrick Dillon, were part of the first West Indies team to participate in the Blind Cricket World Cup, held in Pakistan. Though perhaps Singh's success is no surprise, given that the village where he hails from, Unity, also produced Shivnarine Chanderpaul, former captain of the West Indies cricket team, and women's cricketer Indomatie Goordyal. With another Blind Cricket World Cup set to take place in India in January 2017, the team are hoping to do well at this weekend's regional T20 championships. Coach Bharat Mangru is confident. "This is the first season that we've had a full compliment of B3 players [those with better vision]. They're young, energetic and that feeds the other players. "Over the years we went out there to compete. But I think this year our message is: Win." One potential roadblock to success is the lack of stable financial support. "Prior to a tournament or any time we need funding, we start writing letters soliciting funding from private sector and government agencies. But it's not reliable," says Singh. For the forthcoming trip to Trinidad, they are about $1,500 (Â£1,150) short. "But we're hoping that we can get it. We're always optimistic," says Singh. Yet just as they refuse to let a little rain get in the way of their practice, the team are determined to play on. Coach Mangru is not surprised. "In sighted cricket, the first thing some of the guys would have said is, 'Ah Coach, man! It's raining. We got to come to the ground?' But these guys called me at home from the stadium. "That's the kind of commitment there is."	It is a drizzly Sunday morning in Guyana, and at the National Stadium a game of cricket is in full swing.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said voters had "48 hours to get the Tories out". Former Labour leader Gordon Brown, who was campaigning with Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, said the SNP stood for "divide and rule". The Lib Dems said voters should stick with them and the Scottish Tories said a vote for them was a vote for the UK. During a visit to a nursery in Livingston, West Lothian, Ms Sturgeon criticised Prime Minister David Cameron who had warned the public they risked "five long years" of a minority Labour government reliant on "bribes" to smaller parties like the SNP. She hit back saying: "[There are] 48 hours to get the Tories out, to get an alternative to austerity and to make Scotland's voice heard. "The fact of the matter is, if there's an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning, I want to see that anti-Tory majority come together to get the Tories out, but then make sure that it's replaced with something better. Ms Sturgeon added: "The SNP will be a positive, constructive and progressive force in the House of Commons but will stand up very firmly for the things we believe really matter." In Glasgow, Mr Brown urged voters to reject the SNP and join what he called Labour's fight to reach the "the mountaintop of social justice". And he warned that the election was "not just about the future of the UK but about the very existence of the UK". In an impassioned address, he said: "While the SNP will talk only about deals and pacts and coalitions and bargains and hung parliaments, we will talk day after day, hour after hour, in this late stage of the campaign about only one thing - to end poverty, to end unemployment, to end injustice. "Within days and hours of getting into government, Jim Murphy could be providing money for our foodbanks and we could be ending foodbank poverty. Delivered under a Labour government, with Labour MPs - undeliverable under a Conservative government, even with 59 SNP MPs. "And within weeks, we could be providing the resources that the health service needs: 500 doctors, 1,000 more nurses - deliverable under a Labour government with Labour MPs - undeliverable under a Conservative government with 59 SNP MPs." Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he wanted his party to continue to have influence on government at Westminster. He said: "Liberal Democrats have been at the heart of government over the last five years with 11 members of parliament in Scotland - many at the cabinet table giving a really powerful voice. "Danny Alexander, right at the heart of the government, making it tick - delivering tax cuts, pension rise childcare expansion. "I want that to continue, because Liberal Democrats can hold others back when they travel too fast." While on a visit to Aviemore, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson discussed the possible deals that could be done between parties after polls close and votes are counted. She said: "We have said from the very start that each and every MP elected across all parts of these islands has the same rights and voting as everybody else. But it is up to individual political parties who they do a deal with. "The Scottish Conservatives will not do deals with any nationalist parties in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland who want to break up our United Kingdom. "Each vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to keep the UK intact."	With just two days until the polling stations open, all the Scottish party leaders are warning of the risks of backing their opponents.
They looked at responses to annual surveys that the WHO had sent to 127 countries between 2012 and 2014 asking about capacity and usage of blood tests that check HIV status and health. They found worrying gaps in provision. They warn that United Nation targets for HIV could be missed as a result. The targets say that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV should know their HIV status, 90% of those diagnosed should receive antiretroviral therapy and 90% of these treated patients should have "durable viral suppression" (a measure of effective treatment). Laboratory testing is vital to meet and monitor these aims. But Vincent Habiyambere and his colleagues say in the journal PLoS Medicine that some low and middle-income countries, including African countries where the HIV burden is high, are not yet geared up for the challenge. The surveys were sent to: • all 47 countries in the WHO African Region • 33 countries in the WHO Region of the Americas • all 21 countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region • eight high-burden HIV countries in the WHO European Region • all 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region • seven high-burden HIV countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region Over the three survey years, 55 (43%) countries responded to all three surveys, 35 (28%) to two surveys, 25 (20%) to one survey, and nine (7%) responded to none of the three surveys. Testing provision did improve over the years, but shortfalls remained in some parts of the world. Reasons for the gaps in provision included lack of reagents, equipment not being installed or maintained properly and inadequate or absent staff training. In some laboratories, machines were not serviced regularly. In others, machines broke down and were not covered by contracts to be serviced or fixed. Dr Habiyambere and his team say: "A national laboratory strategic plan to strengthen services must be developed, implemented, and monitored by governments and their national and international partners. "The focus of the international community, to ensure optimal use of laboratory technologies, should be on those countries where interventions for scaling up access to HIV diagnostic technologies are most needed." They acknowledge that they did not look at private sector testing and that some countries might rely more heavily on this than others. In an accompanying editorial, HIV experts Peter Kilmarx and Raiva Simbi say the findings show some programmes may have been "overly focused" on buying equipment without planning for how it would be used and maintained. In Zimbabwe, for example, only 5.6% of HIV patients on drug treatment in 2015 received regular blood checks to monitor their viral load - far fewer than the goal of 21%. This was largely down to problems with resource mobilisation and specimen transport as well as equipment procurement, they say. "Strong leadership, resources, planning, and management are needed to scale up laboratory services," they conclude.	A shortage of HIV testing could undermine global efforts to diagnose and treat people with the infection, warn experts from the World Health Organization.
The actor, who was known to millions as Coronation Street binman Eddie Yeats in the 1970s and 1980s, died "peacefully in his sleep" on Friday night. It followed a "long courageous battle" with prostate cancer, his family said. Hughes, who lived on the Isle of Wight, was also known for his roles as Twiggy in TV comedy The Royle Family and Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances. He had thought he had beaten prostate cancer in 2009, but was told it had returned after collapsing at home in 2010. Hughes first appeared in 1960s shows such as Z-Cars and The Likely Lads. He was the voice of Paul McCartney in the Beatles film Yellow Submarine. Other roles included Vernon in Heartbeat and Uncle Keith in teen drama Skins, guest-starring in episodes of Doctor Who, Casualty, Boon and The Upper Hand. A Coronation Street spokeswoman said: "We are very sad to hear of the death of Geoffrey Hughes. "He created a legendary and iconic character in Eddie Yeats who will always be part of Coronation Street. Everyone connected with the programme sends our sincerest condolences to his family." Coronation Street star William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, said: "I am so sorry to hear about Geoffrey. He was a warm, lovable actor, with great comedy timing. "He will be greatly missed, one of the Street's memorable characters." Helen Worth, who plays Gail McIntyre in Coronation Street, said: "Geoff was a very dear friend for many years, and I'm very sad to hear the news of his passing. "He was a master of gentle comedy and brought pleasure to so many people. He will be sadly missed." Sally Lindsay, who played barmaid Shelley Unwin in Corrie, wrote on Twitter that her first TV job was playing Twiggy's girlfriend in The Royle Family, "and he was so kind RIP lovely man x". Hughes was appointed Deputy Lord Lieutenant for the Isle of Wight in 2009, providing the official link between the island and royalty at formal events.	Coronation Street and Keeping up Appearances actor Geoffrey Hughes has died aged 68, his agent has said.

The Official Chart Show is being moved from Sunday to Friday evenings, as part of a big shake-up of the music charts.
Owens' team suffered a record European defeat as they conceded nine tries in a 64-14 Champions Cup hammering in Paris. With New Zealand's World Rugby player of the year Dan Carter kicking six goals and organising the demolition, Wales international Owens believes Racing will be hard to beat. "It's difficult to stop a side like Racing - they've got the complete package," said Owens. "They are the best team in Europe. "Saracens in England are up there, playing very good stuff. But I think Racing, with the squad they've got, the calibre of player and the different variations in their game, have the edge." Racing beat Scarlets 29-12 in Llanelli in November, before World Cup winner Carter made his debut for the French club. "They had a different mindset when we played them before - they were happy to live off our mistakes," Owens continued. "But today they upped the tempo and brought the game to us and they have definitely improved. "Carter coming in, plenty of experience, a ball-player, really organising the backs - he's made a big difference to their back line. "He allows players to play off him and his organisation - you could just hear him talking - he's a huge asset to any team. He's the best player in the world and it shows." However, head coach Wayne Pivac was not happy with his team's discipline at Stade Yves du Manoir. Scarlets were under pressure, but had stood up to Racing's power before the Welsh region's second row Maselino Paulino was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Yannick Nyanga deep in Racing territory. And within five minutes, Scarlets wing DTH van der Merwe followed the Samoan into the sin-bin for a tip tackle. At that point the score was 10-0, but by the time Van der Merwe returned, Scarlets trailed 31-0. "Twenty-one points came pretty quickly," Pivac said. "Look, they are a class side when it's 15 on 15, let alone taking one and then two players off, so that did hurt us. "So I was disappointed with our discipline in that early part of the game." Scarlets have now lost all five of their European Champions Cup matches this season - with the visit of Northampton Saints still to come.	Racing 92 are the best team in Europe, says Scarlets captain Ken Owens.

The ex-pupils were caught up in a violent dispute outside Holy Cross Primary School in 2001, which made headlines around the world at the time. The Department of Justice confirmed the payments after a Freedom of Information request from the Belfast Telegraph. The DoJ has received eight claims so far, three of which have been settled. The payments were made under the terms of the Northern Ireland Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002. However, the department would not disclose how much money has been paid out to the former Holy Cross pupils, in order to protect their identities. It told the newspaper this level of detail was "exempt from disclosure" under the Freedom of Information Act and would "contravene the first principle of the Data Protection Act". The school was thrust into the international spotlight at the start of term in September 2001, when hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to block the main route taken by the children and their parents on their walk to class. The three-month protest was sparked by a local dispute between Catholic and Protestant residents in Ardoyne, north Belfast. The Protestants claimed that Catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns. However, stones, bottles, fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest. Following the initial violence, the police and Army put up crash barriers to keep a corridor route open for the Holy Cross pupils. Armed police officers escorted the children to class until the dispute was resolved. Ardoyne's parish priest at the time, Fr Aidan Troy, told the Belfast Telegraph he could "fully understand why people who have been through trauma would want to apply for compensation". "These were girls aged between four and 11, they were very young and very impressionable and were deeply affected by it. Every one of us were," he said. The priest added that while he would not "go down the route of compensation myself" he could "well imagine the impact would be very great on children at such a formative age". "You could see their trauma," said Fr Troy. About 100 pupils needed counselling due to their daily ordeal, according to principal at the time, Anne Tanney. Speaking to the BBC in 2004, she said that even as an adult, she was traumatised by the protests . "There were times when I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep," she said. "I used to bite my lip, trying not to cry in front of the children."	Three former Catholic schoolgirls have received compensation for having to walk through loyalist protests on their way to primary school 15 years ago.
The helicopter was trying to find a vulnerable missing person in the Daventry area. It carried on with its mission while a police car was dispatched to investigate the laser. Officers were unable to find out who was responsible. Pilot Paul Atherton said it was "very distracting". Live updates on this story and other news from Northamptonshire He said: "On the police helicopter, I'm the only pilot. "If I get hit in the eye and I'm blinded, who's going to fly the aircraft? People on the ground don't realise how serious this is." The National Police Air Service (NPAS) said Mr Atherton saw two flashes of light from the laser at about 23:00 BST on Friday. The NPAS reported 35 laser incidents on its aircraft in 2014 and 91 in 2015. There was a total of 1,400 attacks on aircraft reported to the Civil Aviation Authority last year. People have been jailed in the past for pointing lasers at aircraft in the sky, but the devices themselves remain legal. Pat Lawrence, a spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said regulations need to change. He said: "There's no restriction on the imports of these very powerful lasers."	The pilot of a police helicopter has called for a ban on lasers after a beam of light was shone at his aircraft as it flew over Northamptonshire.
A PSNI officer posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that the petrol bombs had been found in Colinview Street and were designed to be thrown at officers. They said it followed an incident at Lanark Way earlier this week when a petrol bomb was thrown at police as they stood among a crowd of people including young children. It did not ignite and fell on ground. The police officer described the petrol bomb attack as "sheer recklessness". "Why do some people think it's acceptable to throw items such as this at another human being?," the post said. The police officer added that the 16 petrol bombs had been stashed in Colinview Street "to be thrown at officers again". "Have a think about what you are doing engaging in this type of behaviour, it can't be stressed enough how dangerous this is," the PSNI officer said. "Are we really promoting a society where people are effectively trying to set light to police officers at their day's work?"	Police seized 16 petrol bombs in west Belfast after one was thrown at officers in the area earlier this week.
Volunteers at St Helier Lifeboat Station in Jersey have walked out amid claims Andy Hibbs was "bullied" by senior management at the RNLI. The RNLI said it asked Mr Hibbs to stand down "due to serious breaches of the RNLI's Volunteer Code of Conduct". Claims of bullying are taken "very seriously" and are being investigated, the RNLI said. Mr Hibbs said he thought the organisation was breaking Jersey's laws and said he is "humbled" by the support of his crew. Officials from the RNLI met the crew on Thursday evening after complaints were made against Mr Hibbs, the BBC understands. More on St Helier lifeboat crew resigning, and other Jersey news Mr Hibbs said: "I was sacked pretty much. The whole thing was just a joke. "I was being bullied by senior management in the RNLI and I refused to accept it." A statement from the RNLI said the situation was "incredibly complex" and a "confidential process". It said: "The RNLI has asked one volunteer at St Helier lifeboat station to stand down with immediate effect. "We have worked closely with the volunteer for some time but have been unable to resolve a serious breakdown in the relationship between the individual and the charity. "Unfortunately this impacted on the RNLI's ability to effectively deliver a safe and effective rescue service from St Helier. "Other volunteers have chosen to step down, which has forced the RNLI to declare the St Helier lifeboats off service temporarily. "We understand the impact of standing down volunteers and we do not take such decisions lightly." The St Helier lifeboat should be back in service in a few days, the RNLI said. A former member of Jersey's RNLI has said there will be a protest held on Sunday. Paul Battrick said there would be a "silent gathering" at 10:00 BST to support the volunteer crew members. He said he hoped the protest will get the RNLI "to see sense". Jersey will have lifeboat cover from the other Channel Islands stations - St Catherine's, St Peter Port and Alderney.	All 25 members of a lifeboat crew have resigned in protest at the sacking of their coxswain.
Media playback is not supported on this device Team GB won four medals in Sochi, which matched their total from the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924 in France. Six sports shared a fund of £13.4m over the past four years, but that pot could now be boosted for the 2018 Olympics. We should shed this idea of not being a winter nation. Actually it's not true - we can be "It's been an outstanding Games and the athletes need and deserve the support," said UK Sport chief Liz Nicholl. "I can't say what the investment will be from sport-to-sport as we'll discuss that with them over the coming weeks and months, but I am anticipating more investment in winter sport." Lizzy Yarnold continued Britain's proud tradition of winning a medal at each Olympics in which the sport of skeleton has featured by claiming gold in Russia. The men's curling team took silver and the women bronze, while snowboarder Jenny Jones finished third in slopestyle's Olympic debut. Great Britain finished 19th in the medal table, but the plan - based on the sort of "no compromise" funding policy applied to summer sports post-2006 - is to be higher in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in four years. "We're anticipating building on it and will be going for more medals in 2018," said Nicholl. "The success has shown that the approach we have taken to athletes, and supporting sports with medal prospects, is working. Media playback is not supported on this device "It gives us a huge amount of confidence in the system." Four-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Matthew Pinsent, who has covered both the Vancouver and Sochi Games for the BBC, believes now is the time for winter events to receive the same support as the summer sports. "I think some of the winter sports, like curling, freestyle and short track are performing like summer sports, so why offer different support?" he said. "Germany and Norway don't make this distinction and I think we should shed this idea of not being a winter nation. Actually it's not true - we can be." 1924: Men (curling) 1936: Men (ice hockey) 1952: Jeannette Altwegg (figure skating) 1964: Tony Nash & Robin Dixon (two-man bobsleigh) 1976: John Curry (figure skating) 1980: Robin Cousins (figure skating) 1984: Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (figure skating) 2002: Women (curling) 2010: Amy Williams (skeleton) 2014: Lizzy Yarnold (skeleton) * Madge Syers won figure skating gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London Nicholl said that the funding award would not be anywhere near the £272m divided between 19 summer Olympic sports but insisted that did not mean Team GB could not continue to make improvements. "We'll never be topping the table with the Russians and Canadians, but we can make gains and that is what our investment principles are based on," she said. Having achieved a bronze medal and a record six top-10 finishes, the British freestyle skiing and snowboarding team are well placed for a significant increase on the £1.5m they have received since 2012. "We have big plans on how we can develop and grow the freestyle programme and are hopeful UK Sport will help invest in that alongside commercial partners," Lesley McKenna, British Park and Pipe programme manager, told BBC Sport. The British bobsleigh duo of Paula Walker and Rebekah Wilson were the only team to miss their UK Sport performance target, finishing 12th when seeking a top-eight result. Success does cost money but we are committed to investment However, the men's four-man bobsleigh came an impressive fifth, just 0.11 seconds off the podium. GB Bobsleigh performance director Gary Anderson is hopeful that the set-up - which received £3.3m leading into Sochi and has invested heavily in new technology - will continue to be backed. "We are only halfway through an eight-year programme and with support through to 2018 I'm convinced we can challenge for not just one medal, but in all three events [men's two- and four-man and women's two-man bob]," he told BBC Sport. UK Sport recently axed funding for basketball, synchronised swimming, water polo and weightlifting but Nicholl insisted this announcement was not related to the performances of winter sport athletes in Sochi. It will now enter a series of meetings with officials from all British Winter Olympic disciplines about performance targets over the next four years and reveal its decision in June.	UK Sport says it expects to increase funding for winter sports following Great Britain's record-equalling Winter Olympic performance in Sochi.
Nashat Melhem was tracked down to a mosque in his home town of Arara and killed in a gun battle, police said. The attacks sparked a huge hunt and security alert across the country. Police said Melhem, 29, was the gunman who killed two Israelis at a bar, then the Israeli Arab driver of a taxi who picked him up after the attack. Security camera footage showed a suspect taking an automatic rifle out of his backpack and then firing at least 15 shots at people in the street before fleeing the scene. Alon Bakal, 26, who was a manager at the bar, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, were killed. Taxi driver Amin Shaban died after being found critically injured in the north of the city shortly after the shootings. Melhem's father, Mohammed, identified his son as the suspect and reported him to the police. Mohammed Melhem and several relatives have been arrested in connection with the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated security forces, who he said had "worked tirelessly, methodically and professionally to locate and eliminate the terrorist". Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Melhem was shot dead after opening fire. A witness, Hakim Younis, told Israel's Channel 10 TV he saw a fierce gun battle, the Associated Press news agency reported "I was sitting on my balcony with my cousin... when suddenly shooting began, hundreds of bullets, like in a war," he said. Police have not yet established a motive for the Tel Aviv killings. Israel was already on high alert amid a wave of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs which have killed 22 Israelis since the beginning of October. During that time 149 Palestinians - more than half said by Israel to be attackers - have been shot dead by security forces or their victims. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces. One Israeli Arab was also shot dead after carrying out an attack at a bus station in southern Israel in October in which an Israeli soldier was killed.	An Israeli Arab wanted for shooting dead three people in Tel Aviv on 1 January has been killed by security forces in northern Israel.
I have been out and about, travelling, and watching other travellers recently.  This made me think about the history of comforters. Perhaps tobacco was the first mass comforter. A north London pub I cycle past on the way to work almost every day has an Elizabethan-era panelled upper room from the 16th Century, where (it is said) the great explorer Sir Walter Raleigh used to smoke pipes of the tobacco he brought back from his travels in the New World. The first time that happened in Europe, people say. Jump forward a bit in time and modern mudlarks still scour the exposed banks of the River Thames in London for fragile clay pipes thrown away by the hundreds of thousands in the 17th and 18th Centuries. You can date them by the size of their bowls, which seem to have waxed and waned according to the price of tobacco; the price of filling a pipe, in other words. Conversations could be eked out, doubled in length, by a drag and a puff; a sort of extended breathing pattern that helped Elizabethans and others get through the day. When photography was invented in the 1840s we could finally see how people really lived, as opposed to how a few of them, privileged, posed for the painted version of their lives. Everyone may have worn hats before. But in the street photographs of the 19th Century it begins to look as though hats had become mass comforters - the workers imitating the nobs for whom hats had always been a form of self expression. Hats were a comfortable uniform, I suggest. Enter the age of mass production in the beginning of the 20th Century. Machine-made cigarettes made the comfort of tobacco cheaper and more accessible than ever. Smoking, always a bonding activity, became even more so as people took breaks to exchange smokes. And two world wars brought military travel to men who had never before dreamed of going further than their nearest town. The mass transit of troops enhanced the enforced boredom of conscription; waiting around for a train or a ferry could be punctuated by a quiet cigarette. In the UK after World War Two, National Service in the armed forces regularised the fag break for almost everyone. Sharing a fag or a packet gave a little lift to the waiting around that was the experience for many men's two-year involuntary stay in the Army. But when National Service ended, something happened to the sharing cigarette routine. Horizons had widened as lots of Brits went abroad for the first time, first involuntarily in the war and then on holiday. People took more responsibility for themselves. They started thinking about health. Smoking in public places declined in the most remarkable way in the 1970s and 80s. Perhaps the rise of the PCB plastic bottle had something to do with it. Fag not in mouth, we still needed a comforter. The psychological answer was a new addiction to replace nicotine: bottled water, something to keep people busy just like a cigarette, but demonstrably healthy. A bottle of water to accompany every mobile activity, clutched to the breast. In my childhood, who would possibly have imagined that the British would ever have embraced the continental cult of bottled water? But they did, and it is now challenging the consumption of fizzy sweetened drinks. Extraordinary. Parallel with water but slightly later came the inexorable rise of coffee-to-go, in a container with a mouth hole in it. Another badge of self importance coupled with self indulgence which is very much part of the comforter phenomenon. Meanwhile there's a powerful new entrant to what we might call the comfort zone: filling that top pocket, empty hand, or handbag. It is of course the smartphone, doing much the same (psychological) thing as the cigarette or the pipe - breaking the tedium of the moment with a bit of gratification. Like the social cigarette, the phone links its obsessed user with others - not close at hand now, but the online community everywhere. The new nervous tic, the need to be connected at all the hours of the day. And since carrying bottled water and looking at a phone at the same time takes a good deal of juggling, I wonder whether the comfort of water will eventually be replaced by the phone in a similar way to how a sip of water has replaced the ciggie. After all, beer sales in South Africa are said to have dropped when cheap mobile phones swept the country 15 years or so ago. Instead of going out to drown their sorrows, migrant workers phoned home to the village they had left behind in moving to the townships. And I will bet that the great evolution of the adult comforter has not ended at the smartphone. The screen is cumbersome; sooner or later, it and the keypad will be replaced by data flows wired directly into our brains. But wired from where? Maybe it's time for a revival of the headgear we all routinely wore 100 years ago. The "smart hat" may be on the way. It's an entrancing story, this long line of human psychological and social development. Trace it back, if you like, to the Sumerian farmer sucking on a blade of wheat at the very beginnings of agriculture and civilisation 5,000 years ago. Then the pipe, the hat, the cigarette, bottled water morphing into the smartphone - and then what? A book about this great human progression of comforters would obviously be a best seller, but don't ask me to write it. I'm too busy trying to master my (very uncomfortable) phone.	The cartoon character Linus van Pelt from the Peanuts comic strip has a comfort blanket, and so do lots of children.
These clouds of particles are released in explosive outbursts from the Sun. With the Sun in an active part of its cycle, there are concerns that some storms could disrupt technology on Earth including satellite navigation signals and aircraft communications. The Sun may seem to change little from our viewing position on Earth. With the right equipment, it is possible to see dark regions called sunspots. But up close, our Sun is a dynamic, violent beast. Bright loops of matter arch and twist like fiery fountains above the surface of this gigantic natural nuclear reactor. And every so often an intense burst of radiation called a solar flare appears when magnetic energy - stored in our star's atmosphere - is suddenly released. Solar flares are sometimes associated with the release of high energy particles into space - eruptions that are known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), though these can also occur on their own. A large CME can contain billions of tonnes of gas and other matter that pours into space at several million km per hour. The charged particles in this cloud stream towards any planet or spacecraft in its path. When these particles collide with the Earth, they can cause a geomagnetic storm - a disturbance in the magnetic sheath (or magnetosphere) that surrounds our planet, protecting its denizens from the worst effects of cosmic rays. Many of the effects of charged particles hitting the Earth's magnetosphere are benign, such as polar lights - the Aurora borealis and australis. Geomagnetic storms - often referred to as solar storms - cause these northern or southern lights to become visible at lower latitudes. However, they also disrupt technology on Earth, such as communications systems - including those used by aircraft, satellite navigation signals and electrical power grids. As such, they could wreak long-lasting havoc with communications and power infrastructure across the globe. A 2008 report by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that an extreme storm could cause up to $2 trillion in initial damages by crippling communications on Earth and causing chaos around the world. As such, several agencies around the world are working to better understand the changing conditions near our planet - known collectively as space weather. Forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center monitor activity using data from a network of sensors, including those on satellites, and US Geological Survey instruments that detect magnetic fields (magnetometers). The Sun goes through cycles of high and low activity that repeat approximately every 11 years. It is currently gaining in activity and is expected to peak in 2013 or 2014, although nobody can be sure. This means we can expect more solar flares and more coronal mass ejections over the next few years. The solar cycle we're currently in has been a relatively quiet one in compared with previous ones. But that does not mean that there could not be a large event in the build up to the next "solar maximum". Yes. In 1994, a solar storm caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting television and radio services throughout Canada. In March 1989, another event caused the Hydro-Quebec power grid in Canada to go down for over nine hours. The resulting damages and loss in revenue were estimated to be in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars. But the most significant historic event remains the great solar storm of 1-2 September 1859. This disturbance shorted telegraph wires, starting fires in North America and Europe, and caused bright aurorae to be seen in Cuba and Hawaii. In 1859, our technological infrastructure was in its infancy, but a storm with the magnitude of the so-called Carrington Event would be much more damaging today.

The US administration signalled heavy cuts to UN operations, in its budget proposals released on Tuesday. The US foots more than a quarter of the UN's $7.9bn (Â£6.1bn) peacekeeping bill. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the organisation was willing to discuss how peacekeeping could be made more cost-effective. Mr Trump's budget proposal declares new "attention on the appropriate US share of international spending at the United Nations". The document does not provide a detailed breakdown, but Reuters news agency reports the drop in funding for the operations could amount to $1bn. The spokesman said the UN was studying Mr Trump's plan. "The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the UN to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance," he said. The BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN says such a warning from the organisation is unusually blunt. The US president does not set the budget, but makes recommendations to Congress. It is understood that the UN secretary general has been lobbying Congress members on the importance of international peacekeeping. The US provides 28.5% of the United Nations peacekeeping budget - almost three times as much as the next-highest contributor, China. While Mr Trump's plan does not include details, the US is known to want to cap its contributions to a maximum of 25%. There are currently 16 active peacekeeping operations, including Syria, South Sudan, and on the border of India and Pakistan.	The United Nations has warned that President Donald Trump's plans to cut contributions to peacekeeping will make such work "impossible".
Output rose 9.3% from a year ago, which was up from March's figure of 8.9% but below market forecasts for a 9.5% rise. Fixed-asset investment also weakened in the first four months of 2013. Last week, a separate survey suggested that manufacturing activity, a subset of industrial production, grew at a slower pace in April. "This is not the start of a rally, it is a sputtering whimper as momentum continues to fade," said economists at IHS Global Insight. By Linda YuehChief business correspondent IHS also said that slowing fixed-asset investment - a key measure of government spending - suggested weakness in manufacturing and infrastructure construction, and warned that the pace could fall further amid government efforts to curb the housing market. Separately, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts also warned that there was an increased "downside risk" to the economy. China's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.7% in the first three months of the year, down from 7.9% in the previous quarter. Officials have warned that the economy is set to slow as the government attempts to rebalance the economy by getting domestic consumer demand to drive growth, rather than investments and exports. This attempt now appears to be having an impact. According to government statistics, in the first three months of this year, the largest part of the economy was services - not manufacturing.	Industrial production in China recorded a smaller-than-expected rise in April, underlining worries that the economy may be losing steam.
A few weeks ago we reported very real concerns about the choreography in the aftermath of the summit from Eurosceptic cabinet ministers, worried that the PM would be setting the pace and terms of the debate in its vital early hours. While they didn't commit officially to a position, the sense in Downing Street was that there was no need to shift cabinet from its usual Tuesday spot. They hoped and expected that cabinet ministers who wanted to campaign for exit would keep their counsel until then, when the government had adopted its official position. But in truth, at least one senior figure had already resolved to break their silence and reveal their plan to campaign for Out over the weekend, in defiance of Number 10. With that knowledge, and several frank conversations with Eurosceptic ministers, David Cameron's team have decided to relent. This is not just a story for political process nerds (honest), but it illustrates how Eurosceptics, although in a clear minority in the cabinet, have been able to force Downing Street's hand. This week's summit and now, the 24 hours that follow, are shaping up to be some of the most important in David Cameron's political career.	This afternoon Number 10 has bowed to the inevitable, and conceded that if (and it is still an if) the deal is done at the EU summit in Brussels this week David Cameron will hold a cabinet meeting as soon as he returns to London early on Friday evening.
All but one Welsh council had resettled refugees from the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme by the end of last December. Councils had been criticised for the speed that they were housing people. Oxfam Cymru welcomed the figures, with Conwy and Denbighshire the latest authorities to become involved. The charity's Matthew Hemsley said: "Wales has a proud history of welcoming those in need and it is important to see that tradition being continued." The majority of the refugees in Wales were taken in the second half of 2016 - 285. A total of 5,454 people have been resettled in the UK. The figures from the Home Office come after the Welsh Local Government Association said Syrian refugees were expected to have been housed in all council areas across Wales by the end of 2016. In August 2016, it was reported that only nine of Wales 22 councils had taken part up to the end of June. The statistics said that one authority - Pembrokeshire - was yet to house refugees from the programme at least by the period covered by the figures, which run from October 2015 to December 2016. However the council says it plans to resettle a family in the county by the beginning of April.	The number of Syrian refugees resettled in Wales has reached at least 397, according to figures from the Home Office.
GB Taekwondo have overlooked the world number one three times in favour of Muhammad, ranked 59th in the world. The move has been investigated by the BOA and, while they feel selectors acted properly, they were disappointed by the way the issue has been handled. "There are two world-class athletes directly impacted by this nomination," read a statement issued by the BOA. "Our panel would have preferred to see the selection process managed in a manner that would have been of much greater service to both athletes. Overturning the selection made by a national federation would have been an unprecedented decision for the BOA. They asked GB Taekwondo to reconsider their choice of Lutalo Muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name, and, satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed, the BOA didn't have much choice. That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand. "That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination." GB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision. Performance director Gary Hall said: "This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions." Cook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action. "Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision," said his agent Jamie Cunningham. "He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association. "He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights. What more could Aaron have done? "We urge the World Taekwondo Federation to consider the ramifications of this flawed decision. Aaron will be considering whether he wishes to pursue a legal route to contest this decision over the weekend." Bob Mitchell, solicitor at Harbottle & Lewis representing Aaron Cook, added: "Everyone is extremely disappointed by the outcome today. We have retained a leading sports QC and will be deciding over the weekend what the best way is to proceed for Aaron from a legal and sports perspective. A further statement is likely to be issued early next week." The BOA's Olympic Qualification Standards panel can only accept or reject athlete nominations - it is not within its remit to select individual athletes. However, the BOA noted the importance of working closer with national governing bodies over selection policies for future Games. The panel added it reserves the right to reconsider the nomination subject to an ongoing inquiry by the World Taekwondo Federation.	The British Olympic Association has ratified Lutalo Muhammad's nomination for London 2012 ahead of Aaron Cook.
In December, the government announced finalised plans for a cull, initially in pilot areas, as a way to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle. In applying for judicial review, the Badger Trust says culling will not stop TB and may in fact help spread it. Other campaign groups are considering action under the Bern Convention, which protects European wildlife. The government's plans are likely to result in farmers funding contractors to shoot badgers in a number of areas of England, with two initial pilots in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset taking place later this year. "We have identified some serious flaws in the way by which the Secretary of State [Caroline Spelman] reached her decision to cull badgers," said Gwendolen Morgan of Bindmans solicitors, lawyer for the Badger Trust. "Given that Defra's proposals come at an enormous cost to farmers, and threaten to prompt rather than prevent the spread of disease, we hope that this ill-conceived decision will be struck down by the court." She pointed to government projections that culling would reduce TB incidence by 12-16% over nine years. TheProtection of Badgers Actsays licences to kill can be granted for "preventing the spread of disease" - and the trust argues that the slow-down in the rate of increase, or "reduction in new incidence", projected by Defra does not qualify as "prevention". The government's plan involves having Natural England issue culling licences. The Badger Trust says the guidance given to Natural England is unlawful. Potentially the most important element of its case concerns the methods used to kill badgers. In the landmark UK study, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), badgers were trapped before being shot. However, the government plans to allow licensed contractors to shoot badgers as they roam - "free shooting" - which is likely to be less efficient and to increase disruption of badger families. The RBCT showed that when badger's social groups are disrupted, they roam further, carrying the TB bacterium to more farms. For this reason, the trust argues that after the pilots, farmers may be forced to resort to trap-and-shoot, because free shooting will either prove ineffective or a hazard to public safety. That would escalate the cost by anything up to a factor of 10 - and the Badger Trust says this possibility damages the government's economic case for a cull. As the majority of new cases arise through infection from other cattle rather than from badgers, the trust says the government should simply invest in stricter cattle control measures. Regulations on farmers were recently tightened and testing regimes intensified - but the National Farmers' Union, the government and other proponents believe culling is needed in badly affected areas in addition to existing measures. In 2010, 25,000 cattle were slaughtered as a result of TB infection, and the disease is costing the UK taxpayer in the region of Â£100m per year. They also argue that culling would in the end benefit badgers, as TB infection is seriously debilitating to them. "Nobody wants to see badgers culled, but no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has successfully controlled the disease in cattle without tackling its presence in wildlife as well," said a Defra spokeswoman. "Unless further action is taken now, it will continue to get worse." Badgers are protected under UK law, and also under the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Campaigners are also considering using this as another weapon to use in the long-running battle over culling. Last year, wildlife groups began programmes of vaccination, and some animal groups believe this will in the end remove any need for culling. The Welsh Assembly Government is due to announce its decision on a proposed pilot cull in West Wales early this year. Follow Richardon Twitter	The Badger Trust has launched a new legal challenge to the government's plans to cull badgers in England.
The response from many in that time has been: "Let's get on with it." That view was shared by the First Minister Carwyn Jones until recently when he altered his opinion and said that we should only start the official Brexit negotiations in the early part of next year. My sense is that the public will be flexible on the timing up to a point, as long as they are given a clear sense of direction. The majority of the political establishment have had to come to terms with the fact that most people ignored their advice to remain. So much for being in touch with the electorate. In conversations with politicians on the remain side since, I have come across a mix of bewilderment, frustration and sadness. And while people like me spend a lot of time talking and writing about a Welsh political dynamic, on this subject at least, Wales was a carbon copy of England. In stark contrast, those that supported leaving feel vindicated by their campaign, and now believe they are the ones in touch with vast swathes of the population. The referendum result was a devastating indictment of the effectiveness of the billions of pounds of EU funds spent trying to regenerate economically deprived communities. The brutal reality is that those who were most likely to vote to leave lived in communities where most EU money had been spent. It is an extraordinary paradox that raised eyebrows far further afield than Wales. The early stages of a debate about replacement funding has got under way. The Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, a Remain campaigner, led the way by wasting no time in calling for a fundamental change in approach. Brexit means the Wales Office may have been given a new sense of purpose, and no more so than in regeneration funding. There's been little meat on the bone but his fundamental premise is that everything has to change, and simply writing a Westminster cheque rather than a Brussels cheque will not cut it. The early signs are that the Wales Office would like to play a part redesigning a new funding system. This will not go down well with the Welsh Government but the come-back from Westminster will be that officials in Cardiff have not done a good job spending the money. There will be something just as fundamental going on regarding financial support for the farming industry. This is a devolved matter so the Welsh Government will have a far stronger sense of entitlement to owning any new system that is introduced. So far there have been plenty of warm words about being in listening mode but not much in terms of concrete proposals, or even ideas, about how to create a new system of agricultural subsidies. And finally, what about the Welsh economy? Those who express concern about the impact of Brexit are criticised by Leave campaigners for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Jonathan Evans, a fiercely pro-European politician, talked openly to me about recession, there were a number from within his own party who were deeply unhappy at the tone. But how do you then deal with the facts of the matter regarding things like inward investment, when most companies have come to Wales because of our membership of the single market? That was the elephant in the room when the Welsh Government's Economy Secretary Ken Skates spoke about a renewed focus on promoting Wales abroad in light of the Brexit. It is a huge hurdle to overcome, and something that will depend on the effectiveness of the trade deals that Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox will now have to strike with countries around the world. At the same time, there are strong indicators in the Welsh economy, with a continued trend on unemployment in Wales which is remarkable. The norm has been for a number of months that the rate in Wales is lower than the UK average, reversing years of it being the other way round. The underlying strength of the Welsh economy will be tested in the months ahead with the inevitable uncertainty that will accompany the start of negotiations.	It has been a month since Wales voted to leave the European Union.
While ministers claim their Psychoactive Substances Bill reflects the findings of the experts, I am told that the hand-picked committee was divided on whether low-harm substances like amyl nitrate (poppers) and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) should be included. The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the "safety-valve" clause. The recommendation for "general prohibition" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances "where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed".  The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would "explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed". But when the new Conservative government published the Psychoactive Substances Bill last month, any mention of assessing social harms or health risks had gone.  The safety-valve clause insisted upon by the expert panel had been removed. The Home Office has made it clear that "there is no provision in the Bill to enable the licensing of so-called low-harm substances" arguing that there are difficulties in defining low risk and that it might "send out confusing messages about the safety of new psychoactive substances". It is likely that this is going to be a major battleground as the controversial bill reaches committee stage in Parliament. The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. "As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm," he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's "mental functioning or emotional state", unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary.  This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in "a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood". The word "significant" is, of course, significant. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products. Whether UK ministers will relent on this issue of a "safety-valve clause" is perhaps the biggest question as the Psychoactive Substances Bill makes its progress through Parliament.	After my blog on Wednesday on tensions between drugs advisors and the Home Office, more details have emerged of how the expert panel on legal highs was split down the middle on whether to go for a total ban.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease which is prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions. It is a major cause of illness worldwide, causing about 100 million episodes of feverish illness a year. Its outbreak in Burkina Faso is causing alarm and officials are trying to avoid any widespread panic. One man told BBC Afrique's Yacouba Ouedraogo in the capital, Ouagadougou, that the disease had killed his brother quickly: "My younger brother did not even have a chance to say what was wrong. We just found him dead," he said. Dengue fever particularly affects young children and adults, but is not normally fatal, specialists say. Most people who get it will suffer from headaches and fever. Some get rashes, aches and pains and their symptoms usually last for two or three days. An infected person can feel tired for up to three months, but will not usually need treatment. Cases of the disease have been reported from all 12 districts of Ouagadougou, the World Health Organization says. Two other regions - the Sahel Region in the north and the Hauts-Bassins region in the west - have also reported cases.	Dengue fever has killed at least 20 people in the West African state of Burkina Faso, where about 2,000 cases of the disease have been recorded.
Slade said the precise details of the new structure were still to be agreed. "There's a slight change in structure. It's about getting on, nothing will ever be bigger than the club," he told BBC London 94.9. "My responsibility is for the football. If I can get help from the owner and sporting director, I'll be delighted." Becchetti took control of former owner Barry Hearn's 90% stake in the club earlier this month, with the Italian indicating he is willing to back Slade with funds to strengthen his squad. We came within a penalty shot of going into the Championship and now we need to go a bit better "In terms of the roles and responsibilities - its early days but they need to be sorted out and structured better than they are at the moment," added Slade, who has been at Orient since April 2010. "The owner's never had a football club so he's learning and we're learning too." Slade took Leyton Orient to the play-off final last season, where they lost 4-3 on penalties to Rotherham, and is having to deal with greater expectations from supporters following the takeover. "We want to improve and move forward," said Slade. "We came within a penalty shot of going into the Championship and now we need to go a bit better than last season and it's not going to be easy. "The mood's always good because we've got good people in the changing room but  we won't know until we start the season how that will affect us. "But I think they'll dust themselves down, they're a great group and if we can strengthen the squad that will lift us as well. "We haven't spent too much money so far but we hope that we can attract some quality players. "In the past I've had to make up the squad with loanees or inexpensive squad players, but this season I'm hoping my whole group are all capable of going in at any stage. If we can add two or three more players then that will help in terms of depth."	Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade will work with a sporting director next season after a restructure in the wake of Francesco Becchetti's takeover.
Earlier today George Osborne said he had no plans to do so -  but he refused to completely rule out the move. The coalition government reduced the highest income tax rate from 50% to 45% in 2013. Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, criticised Mr Osborne's refusal to rule out a further cut. Asked on Sky News's Murnaghan programme if there were plans to cut income tax by 5% for those earning over £150,000, George Osborne said "that's not our plan". Challenged as to whether he would explicitly rule the move out, the chancellor replied: "You can judge us by what we say we want to do. And what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions of people are better off. "And when it comes to higher-rate tax payers, our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate to £50,000. "Those are our big tax commitments for the coming Parliament." When asked later if he would cut the top rate of tax, Prime Minister David Cameron said: "It's not our policy.  It's not our plan. "Our plan is to raise to £12,500 the basic rate threshold, so that we take another million people out of income tax altogether and cut tax for 30 million people. That's the plan." But Ed Balls said: "When George Osborne cut the top rate of income tax from 50p down to 45p we know that he and David Cameron wanted to go further and actually cut it to 40p - which, if they were to do that, would mean hundreds of thousands more in tax cuts for the richest people in our society." He added: "They need to tell us is that their plan - they won't rule it out, they should do so now." This election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat minister David Laws has accused the Conservatives of "unbelievable cheek" in taking credit for personal tax allowance rises. Mr Laws, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said the prime minister and chancellor had failed to push for the move in talks with Lib Dems. His party will spell out plans to "go further and faster" in increasing the allowance in the coming days, he said. George Osborne said raising the level was one of his "big tax commitments". The tax-free personal allowance is to rise from £10,600 in 2015-6 to £10,800 in 2016-7 and £11,000 in 2017-8. Mr Laws told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that was down to his party. "What I can tell you is that there hasn't been a single Budget or Autumn Statement in this parliament where the prime minister or the chancellor have ever made this a Conservative ask," he said. "The discussion they've had with Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander have always been on the basis that it's the Lib Dems pushing for this and it's the Conservatives pressing other policies which usually don't help those people on low and middle incomes." The schools minister also told the programme his party would spell out further plans on the issue in the coming days. "The Lib Dems left to our own devices, or putting our position in coalition talks, will want to go a lot further and faster than the measures set out in the Budget recently to help those people on low and middle incomes," he said.

The claim comes after extra fundraising powers for councils were outlined in last week's government Spending Review. But the LGA said councils would still face a combined shortfall of £6.8bn by the end of the Parliament. The government said council tax was expected to be lower in real terms in 2020 than a decade earlier. In the Spending Review, Chancellor George Osborne said local authorities responsible for adult social care would be allowed to increase council tax by 2% above existing limits. By adding in the maximum new levies allowable without a referendum, the LGA estimated that Band D bills could cost an average of just under £200 more over the next five years. It said this would not be enough, particularly as budgets continued to face new pressures such as those caused by an aging population. Any shortfall might have to be made up by further increases to costs such as car parking charges, it added. One senior councillor said councils were now also facing "a reckless gamble" of having to use cash reserves to fund services. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "In reality councils will have almost £200bn to spend on local services over the lifetime of this Parliament, a cash terms increase and a reduction of just 1.7% in real terms each year. "The Spending Review offers a £3.5bn package for adult social care to ensure councils can support their older and most vulnerable residents, while at the same time council tax is expected to be less in 2019-20 in real terms than it was in 2010-11. "With councils accounting for a quarter of all public spending it's right they continue to play their part in paying off the deficit."	Council tax bills in England could cost an average of £200 more for band D properties by 2020, the Local Government Association has warned.
A 5ft x 3ft (1.5m x 1m) void appeared on Whitworth Street on Sunday, resulting in the road's closure between Princess Street and Oxford Street. A section of the busy Mancunian Way has been closed since August, after two holes opened up. Replacement sewer pipes are being installed. United Utilities said sewers underneath Whitworth Street have not been damaged. "Non-urgent" roadworks in other parts of the city have been suspended until after Christmas in order to relieve congestion caused by Mancunian Way's partial closure. Councillor Pat Karney, city centre lead for Manchester City Council, said Whitworth Street should be repaired in time for Monday's evening rush hour. He described the appearance of the latest hole as "incredibly unfortunate". "The council has placed a moratorium on all non-urgent roadworks, but this is the last thing we needed at the moment," he added. He said the council will investigate why the city is being "blighted" by holes. A 40ft (12m) wide sinkhole opened up in August on the Mancunian Way after heavy rainfall, while another hole appeared a month later.	Motorists in Manchester are being frustrated by the appearance of yet another hole in a city-centre road.
Flames could be seen shooting from the roof of Scotway House, close to the city's Riverside Museum, after the fire broke out on Friday evening. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent a number of appliances to the scene. There were no reports of injuries, and the nearby Riverside Museum was not damaged. Scotway House is located on a large plot of wasteland west of Yorkhill Park. It was built in 1885 as a drawing office for ship building firm D&W Henderson at the Meadowside Shipyard, and is a category B-listed building. The building has been empty for about 20 years. Since the doors were closed it has been considered for a pub and restaurant development and a music venue. Last year plans were submitted to convert the building as part of a student housing development on the site. The Glasgow Harbour area is currently undergoing a major redevelopment.	Firefighters have put out a major blaze which swept through a derelict listed building in Glasgow.
Lizzie Mould, from Bristol University, was challenged by Gloucestershire firm Snow Business to come up with a "green" realistic snow for film and television. It took her two years and a "few hundred attempts" but now her new snow liquids are being sold to the industry. Ms Mould, said: "To say that seeing the products on the market is rewarding would be an understatement." The Stroud-based company which specialises in fake snow and ice effects, has previously worked on James Bond film Spectre, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. But in a bid to create a "really good snow effect" which was "robust in different climates", environmentally friendly and would not damage people's skin or leave a residue - they approached the university. "I must have made hundreds of formulations. before we got to where we are today," said Ms Mould, who has now been offered a full-time job with the firm. "The original plan was just to make one fluid but by the end of my project we had two which both worked really well." Recently launched to the industry, Paul Denney, from the company, said as far as they know the new liquids are "the most environmentally friendly falling snow products in the world". "We had looked at developing the product ourselves but the chemistry involved was beyond our capabilities, which is why we approached the University of Bristol," he said. "We weren't totally sure what Lizzie would be able to do, especially as we had a long wish list of characteristics but she's really come up trumps and surpassed all our expectations."	A chemistry student has created "the most environmentally-friendly" fake snow, as part of her research.
The pilot was flying solo during a training flight on Thursday and radioed for assistance while returning to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire. The Hawk jet was promptly joined by another aircraft from the same squadron as a wingman to provide guidance. They then flew in formation and landed safely. The RAF has offered no further details on the condition of the pilot. A spokesman said: "Flying in formation, and conducting an approach to land as a formation, is a daily skill practised by RAF fast jet pilots."	An RAF pilot was guided into landing his jet by a colleague in another aircraft after suffering "a partial loss of vision", it has emerged.
Ray Houghton's tumbling goal celebration at the 1994 World Cup and Salvatore Schillaci's whoops of delight after scoring in the same fixture four years earlier are snapshots of the fervour on display. Angelo Fusco, 81, has been a keen observer of Italy's games against the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for decades, and can boast connections linking all three. He was brought up in Belfast, educated in Dublin, and his father had strong links with the Comino Valley. "I always supported Italy in football and Ireland in rugby as I went to school in Dublin at Blackrock," he said. "Italy comes just a wee bit above the Irish, my mother was Irish and my dad was Italian. "My brother, Carlo, supported Inter Milan and the other three brothers, myself included, supported AC Milan. "I remember in 1990 when Italy won against Ireland at the World Cup, someone threw a brick through the window of a brother's shop in Belfast. "My favourite Italian players have been Cesare Maldini and his son Paolo. I saw Cesare play for AC Milan in the 1963 European Cup final in London against Benfica, I went over to the match with my brothers. "I also went to the Rome derby once between AS Roma and Lazio - I don't know all the Italian curses, but there was a lot of swearing around me. "My brother Carlo played for Distillery, Cliftonville and Portadown in the Irish League. "At Portadown he was a teammate of Wilbur Cush who went on to play at the 1958 World Cup for Northern Ireland." Angelo and his brothers witnessed the infamous 'Battle of Belfast' in December 1957, when Northern Ireland and Italy drew 2-2 in an explosive encounter at Windsor Park. Juan Schiaffino and Alcides Ghiggia, who scored Uruguay's winning goal in the 1950 World Cup final before becoming a naturalised Italian, both featured in the game. It was invalidated as a World Cup qualifier after the Hungarian referee Istvan Zolt's flight was held up by fog, but its new designation as a "friendly" did not stop tempers boiling on and off the pitch. "We all, as brothers, went to the game against Northern Ireland in Belfast in 1957, we were all there supporting Italy and it was a shambles," Angelo said. "It was supposed to be a World Cup match, but the referee did not turn up. "In those days, the goalkeeper in Italy was sacrosanct and was not to be touched. Northern Ireland forward Peter McParland tackled the goalkeeper and took him out, the match turned on that. "When the fans invaded the pitch after the match, they got one of the full-backs on the ground, Harry Gregg and some of the other Northern Ireland players got round him and shielded him." Angelo also recalled how both sets of players met up at a dance hall venue in north Belfast after the game. "There was a big do at the Floral Hall at Bellevue, which was attended by players from the Italian and Northern Ireland teams," he added. "We as brothers sold tickets for the dance that night. The Northern Ireland players that were there included Peter McParland, Danny and Jackie Blanchflower and Wilbur Cush. "The Italian players that were there included Juan Schiaffino and Alcides Ghiggia "The match was rough, but when it is over, it is over and the players move on." Paul Loughran is one of 24 fans from the West Belfast Ireland Supporters Club who will be travelling to the Euro 2016 finals. He said a number of them would be attending the Italy v Republic of Ireland game on 22 June near Lille and highlighted the history that linked the two teams. "It is always a good match, there is always a lot of excitement and tension for both sets of supporters and across the generations," he said. "Ireland had Giovanni Trapattoni as manager, he was born on St Patrick's Day so that was his Irish connection, he also had Marco Tardelli who was Italian, as his assistant. "Liam Brady was a big player for Ireland and he also played for Juventus in Italy and Trapattoni managed him there." Angelo, meanwhile, is just happy to soak up the occasion, whatever the result. "It is great that that the three of them are there, (Italy, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) - it doesn't happen very often."	When the Republic of Ireland and Italy clash at football, passion and pride are usually not far away.
Those who saw a drop in enquiries last month outnumbered those who saw a rise by 22%. That is the highest figure reported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) since August 2008. Rics said the main reason was the stamp duty rise on 1 April, and the uncertainty around the EU referendum. The number of new enquiries fell most dramatically in London, but also fell in nine other regions of the UK. Enquiries rose only in East Anglia, the North and Scotland. Most surveyors also reported a fall in new instructions to sell, and most expect prices to rise over the next three months. Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said the market was characterised by uncertainty. "More ominous is the expectation that both prices and rents will head materially higher over the medium term," he said. Earlier this week the Halifax reported that annual house price inflation fell from 10.1% in March to 9.2% in April.	The number of people interested in buying a house in April fell to its lowest level for nearly eight years, according to surveyors across the UK.
The bill promises new powers for Wales, but there have been claims it would reduce AMs law-making powers. First Minister Carwyn Jones recommended AMs vote for the bill, saying it could be improved but "takes Wales forward". But Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood suggested Wales had been "backed into a corner" over the legislation. The vote was 38-17 in favour of the bill. The Wales Bill offers to extend the transfer of powers over tax, energy, transport and the assembly's own affairs. Labour - the largest group with 29 of the 60 assembly seats - agreed on Monday to back the legislation despite reservations. It was joined in supporting the bill by the Conservatives, ensuring the motion to give consent to the bill passed. UKIP and Plaid Cymru opposed the law - UKIP voted against because it devolved income tax without a referendum and Plaid because of the claimed "roll-back" in assembly powers. The Wales Bill introduces a system of powers that are reserved to Westminster - such as defence and foreign affairs - with everything else assumed to be devolved. But some have claimed that the new devolution model is unclear and have criticised the large list of reservations. In a debate on the bill in the Senedd, the first minister said: "On balance, I believe it is in the best interests of Wales as we look at dealing with the issue of Brexit that we take what is on offer today." Mr Jones said the bill should be seen as "another step on what is a long journey of devolution". However he said there was "a need for improvement" in some areas, such as the lack of devolution of air passenger duty. He added it was "not possible to conclude that the reserved powers model, welcome though it is in theory, is fit for purpose in the long term". "There is no other country that I know of where two legislatures exist in the same jurisdiction", he said. "It's possible in the future that somebody might be arrested in Cardiff for something that is not an offence in Wales." Plaid Cymru decided at a group meeting on Tuesday to oppose the bill. Sian Gwenllian, Simon Thomas and Elin Jones voted in favour, with the rest of the group against. Ms Wood told the debate Plaid was voting against the Wales Bill "with a heavy heart". "We never want to see Wales backed into a corner again," she said. Her party supported the fiscal framework on Wales' funding negotiated between the UK and Welsh governments, she said. But she added: "The UK Government did not have to tie the fiscal framework to a bill that would restrict our ability to make laws. "The public finances of Wales should not be conditional on accepting a worsened legislative framework." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Is any bill perfect? No it's not. "But this bill offers a huge opportunity to take responsibility over energy, over transport, over electoral arrangements, over income tax - the list goes on." He said it was a "sad day when Plaid Cymru in this chamber choose to vote against... [an] opportunity for a huge transfer of responsibility and sovereignty". UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton told the Senedd he supported the broad principles of the Wales Bill. But he said the removal of the need for a referendum before income tax powers were devolved was a "constitutional deficiency we ought not to ignore". He said it was an "important principle that politicians should keep their promises and should be held to their word". Mark Reckless, UKIP AM for South Wales East, added: "They know if they did have a referendum they would lose." Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Davies said the Welsh devolution settlement would need a rethink because of Brexit. It is the fourth Wales Bill since the devolution process began in 1998 with the act which created the assembly. Mr Davies said powers returned to the UK by the European Union after Brexit would require more legislation "to realign those responsibilities". "This will not be the last Wales Bill, but it will be the last Wales Bill in this parliamentary session", he added. Mr Davies also regretted the UK government's decision not to devolve powers over air passenger duty. He said he thought it would be devolved eventually as there was "no coherent argument to hold it back". What is in the Wales Bill? Under a political convention between the assembly and Westminster, the Wales Bill needed a legislative consent motion passed in the Senedd before it can be become law. That is because the Wales Bill relates to devolved matters. The convention does not have legal force but Wales Office minister Lord Bourne has said the bill would not become law if the assembly did not approve it. The vote means the bill will now return to Parliament for the final stages of the legislative process.	AMs have backed the UK Government's Wales Bill in a Senedd vote - meaning the next stage of devolution can become law.
Media playback is not supported on this device Roy was bowled for 162 in England's series-clinching win over Sri Lanka, five short of the 167 not out made by Robin Smith against Australia in 1993. "I was only aware when I walked into the changing room and I saw it on the TV," he told BBC Sport. "I didn't care because winning was the most important thing." Roy also made a century in a record-breaking stand with Alex Hales in the second one-day international. His effort at The Oval, which helped England to a six-wicket win in the fourth ODI and gave them an unassailable lead in the series, meant he had scored 279 runs between dismissals. "Jason Roy is making the most of his form," said captain Eoin Morgan. "That is a big thing in international cricket, you cash in and he is certainly doing that. "It is nice for him to be second on the all-time list of highest scores because he has played a magnificent innings." England have now won three of their five one-day series since an awful World Cup campaign in 2015. They are scoring runs faster than any other international side in the world and their chase of 308 at The Oval was their third in excess of 300 in the past year, having managed similar chases only twice before. "A lot of hard work has been put in," said Surrey right-hander Roy. "The boys put in a serious amount of work and we reap the rewards. These are very exciting times for English cricket. "We're keeping things nice and simple, training hard, and there's a lot of respect for each other. There's an incredible vibe and it's something I'm excited to spend more time in." For Sri Lanka, their best batting effort of the series did not produce a first win over England on this tour, with only Saturday's fifth ODI in Cardiff and a Twenty20 at Southampton on Tuesday to come. "I thought we had a good score on the board but our bowlers were pretty ordinary and Jason took the game away from us," said captain Angelo Mathews. "We were not penetrative enough to get the batsmen out. It was a brilliant wicket, but we could not put the effort in to make breakthroughs. It's time to make a couple of changes."	Jason Roy did not know how close he was to breaking the record for the highest score by an England batsman in a one-day international.
"It's great that we are attracting players of Mandy's calibre to the club," manager Kelly Chambers said. "Mandy will add to our young squad." Centre-back Van den Berg, 26, led her country at the 2015 World Cup in Canada and has been capped 75 times. She played 13 times for Liverpool this season as they finished fifth in Women's Super League 1.	Netherlands captain Mandy van den Berg has joined Reading Women from Liverpool on a permanent deal.
Actor Julian Lewis Jones, Bangor-born star of TV sitcom Stella, was among the team which pulled the 6ft (2m) mako out of the water near Milford Haven. It is thought to be the first ever mako shark caught in Wales. An average mako will grow up to 10ft (3m) in length. Makos swim in excess of 30mph and can weigh up to 300lbs (135kg). Jones - along with Andy Griffith, David Morris and Andrew Alsop - set off at 05:30 BST on Thursday for a day's fishing. They were around 30 miles (50km) off the Milford Haven coast, and had already caught and released two blue sharks weighing 120lbs (55kg) each, when something in the blue water caught their eye. "We saw this flash that whizzed passed the boat - it was a big white belly and it went so, so fast," said the actor. "Next thing this shark leapt 15ft in the air about 20ft off the back of the stern of the boat. "We all looked at each other and said 'that's a mako' and we knew the importance of it. "This is something that you dream of." Jones, who has appeared on angling programmes on Sky TV and Welsh-language channel S4C, said the team all worked together to bring in the shark which had been caught by Griffith. "Mako sharks are aggressive and fast animals and they have been known to actually jump inside boats," said Jones. "It was around 40 minutes before we had him on the side of the boat and he went a bit ballistic and you can't control it - it's a wild animal, it's like trying to control a rhino." The four men managed to slip a circle hook into the corner of the shark's mouth and get him to the deck of the boat. The shark weighed in at around 200lbs (90kg) and measured around 6ft (2m). Once the photographs and measurements had been taken, Alsop gave the shark a kiss on the top of his head and the team released him. Jones said: "We were so privileged, absolutely stoked to have done it and it was the first off the coast of Wales." The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) has recorded 42 mako attacks on humans between 1980 and 2010, three of which were fatal, along with twenty boat attacks. The organisation says divers who have encountered makos say that, prior to an attack, they will swim in a figure-of-eight pattern and approach with mouths open. It is not the first time Jones has had a surprising catch. In May, he saved a young wallaby while fishing off Australia's Northern Territory in the mouth of Darwin Harbour. The waters there are infested with crocodiles and sharks. Jones said at the time: "It looked like it was on its last legs. It was so scared and in the middle of the ocean. It came to our boat perhaps sensing that we would be able to help it."	The fastest shark in the ocean - and a cousin of the Great White - has been caught by a crew fishing off the Pembrokeshire coast.
The 24-hour industrial action is part of an ongoing dispute over staffing and the role of conductors. A strike planned for 4 April on Southern routes was moved to 8 April after the company offered fresh talks. Merseyrail said coinciding a strike with the race meeting would damage Liverpool's reputation. Speaking after its failed talks with the union on Monday, Merseyrail's managing director Jan Chaudhry-van der Velde said the strikes would "do immeasurable damage" as the "eyes of the world will be on Liverpool" during the Grand National. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the "cynical and hostile stance from Merseyrail" left the union "with no option but to put on this additional strike action". He said the RMT "recognises the severe impact that the action will have" but asked the public "to understand that we have no option but to take this high-profile action to force the company back to the negotiating table". Mr Chaudhry-van der Velde said the RMT "has sunk to a new low" by inflicting "a barefaced attack on the reputation of our region" on "one of its proudest and most important days of the year". Merseyrail has "a range of contingency plans" which would "almost inevitably involve using buses to replace trains", he said. Mr Cash called on Southern to "get out of the bunker and to start making some progress". He said RMT members on Southern "have shown incredible strength and resilience throughout the past year" and "have been clear from the off that this is not a dispute about who opens the doors". "It is a dispute about a safe method of operation and about the guarantee of that crucial, second safety-critical member of staff," he said. A Southern spokesman said: "We have received no official confirmation from the RMT and will review our response when we do." Richard Allan, deputy managing director of Arriva Rail North, said he was "surprised" at the move as "we had been in contact with their officials in the last 24 hours to organise further talks". David Sidebottom, director of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: "Yet more strikes are being dumped on passengers who may have to cancel plans or endure miserable journeys. "It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to resolve this matter without bringing the railway to a standstill." Up to 2,000 staff at Southern rail, Merseyrail and Northern rail walked out on 13 March in the ongoing dispute but only limited disruption was reported.	Workers on Southern, Merseyrail and Arriva Trains North are to hold fresh strikes on 8 April, the day of the Grand National, the RMT union has said.
The 13-month-old was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow in December 2012. A second inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was "unascertained". It was due to be held in Kendal from 15 May and will be rescheduled for October while her father seeks legal aid. Poppi Worthington death: Key dates David Roberts, senior coroner for Cumbria, said the adjournment followed a request by Poppi's father, Paul Worthington, who had been unable to secure legal aid in sufficient time. Mr Roberts said it was "of real importance for Mr Worthington to take part in the process and it will be difficult for him to do so in the absence of legal representation". He added: "It is self-evident my findings and conclusion at the inquest may (depending upon what they are) have significant ramifications for Mr Worthington." A family judge previously ruled the toddler had been sexually assaulted by her father, who has always denied any wrongdoing. No-one has been charged in connection with Poppi's death. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had no "realistic prospect" of securing a conviction. The second inquest was initially suspended in September after the CPS carried out a review of the case, concluding it was right not to bring any charges against Mr Worthington.	The second inquest into the death of Cumbrian toddler Poppi Worthington has again been adjourned, a coroner has confirmed.
The 27-year-old Israeli international joins from Ashdod for an undisclosed fee, after spending last season on loan at Easter Road. "It was not so easy, but I'm happy to get it done finally," Marciano told Hibs TV. "My first season was hard and I didn't really know what Hibs means, but it was an amazing experience." Marciano made 28 appearances for Hibs last season as the Edinburgh club secured their return to the top-flight by winning the Championship. He is the club's fourth signing of the summer - after Efe Ambrose, Danny Swanson and Simon Murray - and will compete with Ross Laidlaw for the starting goalkeeper slot in the Premiership this season. "I wanted to become a better player when I came here and I think I did that," Marciano said. "That's why I wanted to come back to Hibs - because I have everything here to be a better player. "And of course the fans are amazing and it's a privilege to play in front of them every week."	Hibernian have completed the permanent signing of goalkeeper Ofir Marciano on a four-year contract.
Trees for Life said a mother and at least two kits have been observed on a river near Beauly. It has asked that the mammals be allowed to remain where they are or be relocated. The government has instructed that the beavers be trapped and then kept in captivity. Trees for Life believes the animals have been in the area for at least five years. The presence of beavers has been found previously in the Highlands. In 2008, one was found dead on a beach at Eathie on the Black Isle after suffering what police described as a "cruel" death after ingesting a large quantity of sea water. Police suspected the animal was linked to illegal releases of beavers in other parts of Scotland. Native Scottish beavers were hunted to extinction in the 16th century. Last year, the Scottish government announced that beavers reintroduced to Scotland could remain and were given protected status. Eurasian beavers taken from Norway were released at Knapdale in Argyll in 2009. An illegally-released population has also been discovered in Tayside. Both groups will be allowed to expand naturally but will be managed to protect farmers and land owners. But in the case of the Beauly beavers, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the animals had been released illegally and must be removed. She said: "We have been clear that we are minded that beavers can remain in Scotland and that their range can expand naturally. "But the unauthorised release of beavers is a criminal offence and will damage the beaver reintroduction project. "That is why I am asking Scottish Natural Heritage to take swift action in the Beauly area. We must avoid a repeat of the experience on Tayside." Alan McDonnell, conservation projects manager at Trees for Life, said the government's decision was "disappointing". He said: "Whilst we understand that the minister wants to address the concerns of landowners in Tayside, the situation here is very different and we think it is possible to consult and negotiate with landowners in the immediate vicinity of the family and upstream to find an alternative outcome for the animals. "We think these beavers have been active at this site for at least five years without any local concerns being raised. Which just goes to show that in the right location, beavers and other land use interests can co-exist successfully."	A conservation charity has asked the Scottish government to protect a family of beavers found to have been released illegally in a part of the Highlands.
About 41,000 people descended on the city's Golden Mile to mark the Hindu festival of light, with entertainment including fireworks and dancing. The lights switch on earlier this month also attracted a record attendance with 37,000 in Leicester's south Asian area. The festival, also marked by Jains and Sikhs, celebrates the victory of good over evil. At the centre of Leicester's celebrations was a 110ft (34m) ferris wheel, known as the Wheel of Light. About 6,000 coloured lamps were strung up around the city. As well as fireworks and the street lights, shops put on entertainment and there was traditional dancing and music to mark the festival. Rangoli sand art decorations and light displays also wowed the gathered crowds. The demolition of the Belgrave Flyover last year allowed for an extension of the celebration along the full length of Belgrave Road.	A record number of people celebrated Diwali in Leicester in what is thought to be the largest event outside India.
The second row had been an ever-present part of Eddie Jones' England side in 2016 before being ruled out of autumn Tests wins over South Africa and Fiji. Kruis, 26, was part of a 32-man training squad that gathered at England's training base on Sunday. Fellow England lock Joe Launchbury was cited on Sunday night for an alleged kick in Saturday's win over Fiji. England's autumn Test series continues against Argentina at Twickenham next Saturday. Kruis, who missed Saracens' win at Sale on Sunday which sent the champions back to the top of the Premiership, has won 18 caps since making his debut against New Zealand in 2014. He was an integral part of the side which won the Six Nations Grand Slam earlier this year, and started all three Tests in the series whitewash against Australia in the summer. England's four-Test autumn series concludes against Australia on 3 December.	Saracens' George Kruis has been added to the England squad after recovering from ankle surgery.
The 35-year-old ex-England batsman, who made his highest Twenty20 score with 115 not out from 66 balls on Wednesday, hit seven sixes in 100 from 45 balls. It took Durban-based Dolphins to their 168 target as they beat the Knights by nine wickets with 20 balls to spare. Pietersen will appear in two more games for the Dolphins before heading to Australia for the Big Bash League. The South Africa-born batsman last played for England in the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash in Australia and was told in March that year that he was not part of England's future plans. Meanwhile, there was a new Twenty20 world record in New Zealand as former Kiwi opening batsman Peter Fulton claimed five outfield catches for his Canterbury province against Northern Districts in their domestic Super Smash T20 league. Listen to BBC World Service's Stumped programme, featuring an interview with Kevin Pietersen.	Kevin Pietersen smashed a second successive unbeaten hundred in South Africa's Ram Slam T20 event.
Lord O'Donnell told the Times it would take Parliament "years and years and years" to separate fully from Brussels. "It very much depends what happens to public opinion and whether the EU changes before then," he said. He later told the BBC he did not think the EU would make the radical changes needed for the UK to remain a member. As Gus O'Donnell, he was cabinet secretary from 2005 to 2011 and is now a crossbencher in the House of Lords. Lord O'Donnell told the Times: "Lots of people will say 'we've had the referendum, we've decided to go out, so that's it, it's all over'. "It might be that the broader, more loosely aligned group is something that the UK is happy being a member of." Asked about these comments, he told BBC Radio 4 this was an example of a "low-probability event that might mean we don't leave". He also said his "central assumption" was that the EU would not radically change. "The probability of us not leaving is very, very low and we need to get on and implement the people's decision," he added. Lord O'Donnell said making Brexit happen would be difficult, partly because article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the step required to officially begin the process - was designed "in a way that is very strongly in favour of those who are staying, not the leaving party". He said he "wouldn't be in a rush" to trigger article 50, as the government must first work out a "strategic plan to say 'what kind of UK do we want, what's our place in the world, what are we trying to achieve in these negotiations'". Handling Brexit would be an "unprecedented challenge" for the government and the civil service, he added. In his interview in the Times, Lord O'Donnell said Theresa May - who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the UK public voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU - now faced a "really difficult job". "She's got to corral all these different individuals, come up with precisely what version of Brexit we want, what works best for the British people, and then go about implementing it," he said. He said he was "not a big fan of referenda", adding that there were "ridiculous claims" on both sides in the UK's debate on EU membership. Mrs May has said formal talks on Britain's "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU will not begin until next year - but she has been clear that "Brexit means Brexit". Gus O'Donnell served as a press secretary under John Major, and then as cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - in the cabinets of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.	A former head of the civil service has said the UK might remain in a "more loosely aligned" European Union, despite the referendum vote to leave.
Hong Kong police said a male 39-year-old foreigner alerted airline staff early on Monday, who then called the authorities. Police said the man had lost two watches and foreign currency. Local media said the man was a Turkish watch merchant flying in economy class from Dubai. A spokesperson for Emirates, the airline the man took to Hong Kong, told the BBC: "Emirates is working closely with the police department and providing information to assist with their investigation." Emirates said it would not be providing further comment, citing the ongoing investigation. There have been increasing reports of mid-air thefts around the world, some of which are said to involve organised gangs.	A man has lost HK$2m ($257,730; £175,530) in cash and valuables from his hand luggage, during a flight into Hong Kong, police said.
Connor Smith, 19, "turned" on work colleague Anil Jnagal during a night out on Birmingham's Broad Street, the city's crown court heard. He was drunk and had cannabis before attacking Mr Jnagal, who had been trying to calm him down. Smith admitted wounding and his barrister said he was remorseful but added "nothing is going to bring the complainant's ear back". More updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country Prosecutor Tariq Shakoor said Smith, of Summerlee Road, worked with Mr Jnagal, 25, at a branch of Harvester in Birmingham's Star City leisure complex. He told the court the victim remembered Smith "turning on him" and the pair fell to the floor, where the defendant bit his ear. The court heard reconstructive surgery was unlikely due to the nature of the injury. Jonathan Barker, defending, said Smith was in an emotional state at the time of the attack due to the recent death of his aunt. Sentencing, Judge Richard Bond, said: "All the victim did was to try and stop you being aggressive towards others. "It ended up with you quite deliberately using your teeth as a weapon and you bit off a really large chunk. About half of his ear has completely disappeared. "This is not something that happens in a millisecond - to bite through somebody's ear takes real determination and a real effort."	A man who bit off half his friend's ear has been jailed for two years.
The giant striker was in the right place at the right time to bundle home the loose ball, after Morecambe's defence failed to clear, earning what could be an important draw. They dropped to 11th, but remain just a point behind Blackpool in the final play-off spot and within two points of sixth-placed Carlisle. Gareth Ainsworth's side had fallen behind eight minutes earlier when Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored a superb opener. Ellison received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area but turned quickly and curled a delightful effort past Jamal Blackman from the edge of the box. The first half saw no goals, but plenty of endeavour from both sides. Blackman was the busier of the two keepers making three excellent saves from three different players. His best was a flying effort to tip away Michael Rose's 30-yard drive which was heading for the top right-hand corner of the Wycombe goal The on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper then did well to tip over Paul Mullin's drive and a low volley from Ellison that was destined for the bottom left-hand corner.

As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of "an alleged breach of planning laws". Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. "If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger." Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: "Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. "We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. "As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. "However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development." Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: "Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. "We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation."	Residents have called for urgent action amid claims that a new mass Traveller site is being created at the end of their road in Essex.

He told the BBC the EU was "broken" and "undemocratic" and told the Sun many Labour councillors would "shock" Westminster with their referendum vote. Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner has also said he will vote to leave the EU. Labour's leadership is campaigning to stay in the EU and says Labour votes will be crucial in the referendum. Senior party figures including Ed Miliband, Tom Watson and Yvette Cooper are attempting to mobilise Labour voters to back the Remain campaign later, with warnings of what they say is the potential economic impact of a vote to leave. Among Labour voices suggesting the party must do more to get its supporters to back Remain are London Mayor Sadiq Khan and GMB leader Tim Roache. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. But Mr Mann told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's not that Labour's not getting its message across to Labour voters, it's that Labour voters are fundamentally disagreeing on this issue." He said he had tried putting the case for and against in public meetings but had "found it impossible to argue the case for because the EU's fundamentally broken, it's undemocratic and even when you want to get changes - as David Cameron tried - you can't get them". He said, on immigration, the EU's free movement of people did not allow the UK to plan for pressure on its public services. The Bassetlaw MP, who has been critical of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, denied his stance was anything to do with "internal Labour Party politics" adding: "Jeremy Corbyn is far more in touch on this issue than [former leader] Ed Miliband - hence he's been more equivocal in some of the things he has said." Tap here to enter your postcode. He added: "Dennis Skinner has done an article in the Morning Star today - he's one of Jeremy's big supporters." Writing in the Sun, Mr Mann said many Labour councillors would "shock" Westminster with their referendum vote and said a "people's revolution is under way" which was about "returning power to the people". He wrote: "It is not sustainable to have 300,000 new people added to the population every year. It has created two kinds of people in this country: the people who gain from this and the people who lose out." Bolsover MP Mr Skinner told the Morning Star he did not believe progressive reform of the EU could be achieved. "My opposition from the very beginning has been on the lines that fighting capitalism state-by-state is hard enough. It's even harder when you're fighting it on the basis of eight states, 10 states and now 28. "What [the EU] should be doing, if it wanted to convince people like me, is have a directive to get rid of zero-hours contracts across the whole of the EU. That's what I'd be looking for." Sadiq Khan, the newly-elected mayor of London, said on Thursday that Labour had a "monumental responsibility" to ensure it mobilised supporters to vote in favour of continued EU membership. "The worry that we have is, for understandable reasons because a lot of the media attention has been on so-called 'blue on blue' attacks - Boris Johnson versus David Cameron, Michael Gove versus George Osborne - Labour voters have been turned off," he said.	Labour MP John Mann has said he will vote to leave the EU and says Labour voters "fundamentally disagree" with the party's official position.
This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume. Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated. This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters. The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights. As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'. There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships. But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite. "There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long," said Coleman. "We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that." Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed. It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home. With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium. He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack. Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making. In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection. Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu. There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: "When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off." From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football. For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success. The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends. Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best. These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football. The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side. Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal. "My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today," he said. "He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him." Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of "There's only one Speedo" heard at every game. A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not. Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud. Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey. Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait. The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success. "The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves," he said. "We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack." Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement. Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff. Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.	Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal.
The 50km (31 mile) HK Ultramarathon saw competitors cover the same stretch of road 25 times. Nestor Wong won the event in 3:24:20 and defended the course, saying it helped to hear the cheering crowds. An ultramarathon is defined as any race above the standard marathon distance. Ahead of the event, local runners criticised the course. "It will be boring and very difficult, if not dizzy, for the runners who will have to do 25 laps of the same stretch of road," Thomas Kiprotich told the South China Morning Post. "I don't mind monotonous courses, but this is a bit extreme monotony for my tastes," Michelle Lowry added. Kwan Kee, chairman of the Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association and one of the race organisers, conceded that the course was "quite boring". But he told AFP spectator access would help: "It was great that we could secure this course in the heart of the city... land in Hong Kong is very limited."	Hundreds of runners have competed in Hong Kong's first inner-city ultramarathon, despite organisers describing it as "quite boring".
Steve McQueen's drama will play at more than 1,000 locations in the US and Canada from Friday, up from 411 last weekend, according to Variety. The memoir on which the film is based has seen a similar boost, jumping more than 300 places in Amazon.com's chart. Solomon Northup's book is now in 16th place, having previously been ranked in 326th place before Sunday's ceremony. The title charts even higher on this side of the Atlantic, currently occupying third place in the Amazon.co.uk bestsellers' countdown. 12 Years a Slave was named best picture at this year's Oscars and won additional honours for supporting actress Lupita Nyong'o and screenwriter John Ridley. The film has made more than $50 million (Â£27 million) in North America, according to the Box Office Mojo site, and has just been released on DVD and Blu-ray. McQueen's film tells of how a free-born black man, played by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, is kidnapped and forced into slavery before finally winning his freedom 12 years later. Interest in Northup's 19th Century memoir has been revived following the success of the film, with many public high schools adding it to their curricula and reading lists. According to Screen Daily, film distributor Lionsgate is also planning to increase the number of screens that Dallas Buyers Club is playing on in the US and Canada. The film, about an HIV positive rodeo cowboy who uses illicit means to obtain unlicensed Aids medication, also received three Oscars on Sunday. Stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto were named best actor and best supporting actor respectively, while the film received an additional accolade for its make-up and hair styling. Meanwhile, the Walt Disney studio has announced that Frozen - winner of this year's best animated feature Oscar - has now made more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office. It says the film is now the biggest non-sequel animated film ever released and the second biggest animated film of all time globally, after Toy Story 3.	Cinemas in the US are scheduling extra screenings of 12 Years a Slave after it won the best picture Oscar.
The former Superior General of Missionaries of Charity was suffering from various ailments. She took over the running of the charity after Mother Teresa died in 1997 and ran it for 12 years before Sister Mary Prema took over in 2009. The Missionaries of Charity cares for the homeless and dying in Kolkata. Archbishop of Kolkata Thomas D'Souza told the AFP news agency that Sister Nirmala "passed away peacefully, surrounded by sisters praying for her". "She had been suffering from a heart disease for quite some time, but she never lost her smile and was always cheerful." He said Sister Nirmala "carried forward Mother Teresa's legacy of compassion, gentleness, service to the poorest of the poor and holiness of life". "Even after she ceased to be head of Missionaries of Charity, she served the people with the same zeal as she did before." Reports say Sister Nirmala's body will be kept at the Missionaries of Charity headquarters in Kolkata and her funeral will be held on Wednesday afternoon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to the deceased nun. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was "saddened" by Sister Nirmala's death. The Missionaries of Charity has about 4,500 nuns and hundreds of homes around the world.	Sister Nirmala, the nun who succeeded Mother Teresa as the head of a charity in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta), has died, aged 81.
The ticket for the Grosvenor in Norwich was bought for seven shillings and sixpence and signed at the gig by John Lennon and Ringo Starr. It also states the band were supported at the now defunct venue on Prince of Wales Road by local band Ricky Lee and the Hucklebucks. The ticket is being auctioned by Bonhams on 3 July. At the time of the gig The Beatles were celebrating their first number one single From Me To You, which stayed at the top of the British singles chart for seven weeks. Bonhams said if the ticket also contained the signatures of Paul McCartney and George Harrison, it would have been worth nearer £4,000.	A signed Beatles ticket from a concert in Norfolk in 1963 is expected to fetch up to £2,000 at auction in London.
The hour-long session featured questions on Brexit, steel, devolution and the Severn crossings. Committee chair David Davies, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, opened with this question: "May I begin by asking what you think are the potential advantages to Wales of Brexit?" Mr Cairns, who campaigned for Britain to remain, gave this hesitant reply: "Well there are certainly lots of challenges. The advantages are that we are almost forced to look elsewhere other than Europe and we need to remember we're not turning our backs on Europe, we're just merely leaving the European Union and nations across Europe will still remain friends and allies. "The advantages are that we will need to focus our efforts on seeking new international trade opportunities and in developing relationships between Welsh business and Welsh stakeholders with those new markets. There are of course a whole series of other issues and challenges that will remain." He did concede there could be short-term "additional marketing opportunities" for tourism from the fall in the value of the pound. Mr Cairns said he had been holding some "stakeholder engagements" to discuss the impact of Brexit Questioned about devolution, he said there are no changes planned to the Wales Bill other than those he has previously signalled at committee stage. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts complained that the Bill was going through Parliament so quickly it was difficult to scrutinise properly. Mr Cairns said every debate had finished with time to spare. Asked about the dropping of the commitment to hold a referendum before Wales gets income tax powers, he told the MPs: "Tax is an absolutely essential part of devolution policy." He added: This is about mature, accountable devolution." He said he intended to have a fiscal framework agreed with the Welsh Government before the Wales Bill becomes law. Asked about funding, he said: "There are no plans to change the Barnett Formula." He said the funding floor introduced by the government meant funding per head was set at around 115 % of the English average. On the steel industry, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said that there were some concerns about the possible joint venture of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel Europe. Mr Cairns said: "ThyssenKrupp are prepared to invest significant sums of money into a joint venture scheme with the offer of support from the UK government, and that in itself we can take encouragement from because that shows they're prepared to spend money." He said taxpayers' money would only be used if there was a viable sustainable future in steelmaking. It wouldn't be a Welsh affairs select committee without a question from David Davies on the Severn crossings. He was concerned that the government might try to make a profit out of them once they return to public ownership. Apparently, it won't.	MPs on Parliament's Welsh affairs committee have been grilling Alun Cairns for the first time since his appointment in March.
Robert McNaughton, 51, from Halesowen, set up fake Facebook accounts to troll the woman, West Midlands Police said. The force said he was "hell bent" on destroying her life after she spurned his reconciliation attempts. McNaughton, of Tenter Drive, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Sgt Chris Jones said: "McNaughton could not handle being rejected and became hell bent on destroying his ex-partner's life." During December 2014 and February 2015, he bombarded her with abusive Facebook messages, threatening to release intimate images. He also hired two men, Matthew Barker and Joden Smith, to carry out a string of attacks on her home, culminating with her car being set on fire in February 2015. Barker, 44, of Leicester, admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage and was jailed for 43 months. Smith, 20, also of Leicester, admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage and arson, recklessly endangering life and was sentenced to four years at a young offenders institution. The men were sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 31 March.	A man who began a hate campaign against his ex-partner, which culminated in her car being petrol bombed, has been jailed for five years.
The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night. Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters". He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14". Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating." Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.	Star Wars and Harry Potter star Warwick Davis, who played an ewok in Return of the Jedi, has taken to Twitter to help recover his stolen caravan.
Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. "We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that," said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as "near threatened" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. "When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down," Mr Fretwell told BBC News. "But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures." There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: "These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. "The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. "We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions."

United will be in the Champions League and boss Jose Mourinho said executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has had his targets "for more than two months". Mourinho wants to enhance his forward and defensive options to challenge for the Premier League title next season. United have been linked with Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and Burnley centre-back Michael Keane. "Ed Woodward has my list," the Portuguese manager said after his side beat Ajax to win the Europa League for the first time on Wednesday. "Now it's up to him and the owners." Griezmann has a 100m euro release clause in his contract and the 26-year-old France international said earlier this week that his chances of joining United were "six out of 10". Since then, a major stumbling block has been removed by United securing the return of Champions League football. They will go straight into the group stage after their victory over Ajax in Stockholm. Griezmann has the pace and trickery United lack but, should a move falter, Torino forward Andrea Belotti is another option. The 23-year-old Italy international has scored 25 goals in Serie A this season. Keane, meanwhile, left United for Burnley in January 2015 but Mourinho is known to be eager to bring the 24-year-old defender back to Old Trafford. The Portuguese views predecessor Louis van Gaal's decision to sell the centre-back for £2m as a mistake and believes his central defensive options are limited. In theory, a 25% sell-on clause agreed at the time of that deal should bring the price down. However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche has said the Clarets have no financial need to sell Keane, who made his England debut in March. Prior to the January transfer window, United showed interest in Benfica's Sweden centre-back Victor Lindelof, 22, while left-back is another area of weakness. Earning Champions League football means United have avoided the potential loss of £50m in sponsorship income and prize money. However, one senior club source said the forthcoming transfer window was likely to be "crazy", given the increased spending power within the Premier League as a result of the new £8.3bn TV deal and clubs such as Inter Milan and AC Milan willing to spend big to try to rediscover former glories. A year ago, Mourinho marked his first summer at Old Trafford by bringing in striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, defender Eric Bailly and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan by the first week in July, before midfielder Paul Pogba re-signed from Juventus for a world record £89m in early August. In December, BBC Sport was told the United manager felt he needed at least two more transfer windows to shape his squad. Mourinho decided not to buy in January, but since then Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo have suffered cruciate knee-ligament injuries which will keep them out until next year and former Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has left for Major League Soccer in the United States. United went on to finish sixth in the Premier League which, apart from the disastrous campaign under David Moyes in 2013-14, was their lowest placing since 1991.	Manchester United are likely to limit their summer spending to three or four key signings.
The unfancied Blues were galvanised from the outset, and took the lead after 12 minutes when Elliott Durrell netted with a stunning volley from 25 yards. John Still's men were still reeling when Theo Vassell slid a superb ball through to Tom Shaw, and the midfielder bided his time before smashing past Elliot Justham. Liam Roberts did his bit in the Chester goal, parrying a firm Oli Hawkins header. After the break, an inspired Chester pushed on and Johnny Hunt whipped in a cross for James Alabi to head in and crown a fine night. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Ex-BBC journalist Jacky Sutton, 50, was found dead in a toilet at the city's Ataturk airport between 17-18 October. She was the acting Iraq director for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) and was travelling from London to Irbil, northern Iraq. In a statement Jenny Sutton, Ms Sutton's sister, said "at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone". But the statement added that there remained "the possibility that additional information will come to light". An investigation into the death is currently being carried out by Turkish authorities. The statement said the family and the IWPR had carried out an "extensive review" of information provided by Turkish authorities. Jenny Sutton said: "The family is satisfied with the investigation undertaken by the Turkish authorities. "We were deeply sceptical about initial reports. But based on the evidence we have seen, at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone." The family and the IWPR said the Turkish authorities had provided access to "the complete dossier of evidence" relating to the case, including copies of CCTV images from the airport and witness statements. This all indicated that Ms Sutton had been alone and there was no evidence of a struggle, they said. The decision to release information from the investigation had followed "widespread speculation" about the circumstances surrounding Ms Sutton's death, the statement added. The IWPR and the family said they would seek a further assessment from an independent investigative expert to confirm the findings once the Turkish investigation was complete. The London-based IWPR supports local journalism in countries affected by conflict and crisis. Its previous Iraq director, Ammar Al Shahbander, was killed in a car bomb attack in Baghdad on 2 May and a memorial service had been held for him in London last week, according to the IWPR website. Ms Sutton had been in London attending the service. Ms Sutton worked for the BBC World Service between 1998 and 2000, reporting from Africa, the Middle East and London. She also served in senior roles at the United Nations. The IWPR described Ms Sutton as "extremely bright" and "universally loved".	No other parties were involved in the death of a British woman at an Istanbul airport, her family believes.
The biggest football match in the nation's history ended 2-0 to Portugal in the semi-final on Wednesday. Thousands of Welsh fans travelled to France for the historic game in Lyon. Prime Minister David Cameron and Wales' First Minister Carywn Jones were among those to give praise. Mr Cameron tweeted: "Well done to @FAWales for their fantastic performance during #Euro2016. You've inspired a nation and made Britain proud." Mr Jones said: "Very proud again tonight. Sad it's over but @FAWales and fans fantastic throughout this historic #EURO2016. Diolch. #TogetherStronger." Despite their loss and their defeat to England in the early rounds of the tournament, Wales are set to move above their rivals in the Fifa world rankings to 11th while England are placed 13th. Wales star Gareth Bale thanked fans for their support after the match, tweeting: "No regrets tonight, we gave everything. Thank you for all the support!! #TogetherStronger." The team had surpassed the wildest expectations of their fans over four thrilling weeks in the tournament. More than 20,000 supporters were estimated to have travelled to Lyon, with thousands more watching at fan zones around Wales. But two quick goals early in the second half of the semi-final in Lyon from Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani dashed Wales' hopes of reaching the final. Wales started the tournament as 100/1 outsiders but they beat Northern Ireland and Belgium in the knockout stages to reach the last four. Fans in Lyon were quick to praise their team's efforts despite bowing out of the tournament so close to the end. Mark Morgan, of Brecon, Powys, 24, who watched the defeat in the Lyon fan zone, said: "I'm very proud of the team. Why wouldn't you be proud?" "A squad of our players should not be  getting here, let's be honest, but we've done it and I'm very proud," he added. "I've been in tears in four games." Nick True, 40, of Cardiff, said: "I'm a bit gutted but also quite uplifted. "I think we've done well. It's hard to be positive in the face of a defeat but if you look at where we have come from, and how we've managed with the bigger and better teams, it's the team spirit that's done it." Brian Harry, 47, who lives near Mold, Flintshire, said: "It's the first time in my life time that we've been in a tournament. "We couldn't have done better. I came all the way over here [to Lyon] just for this and I'm just so proud of the boys. They've done Wales proud." Other sports men and women took to Twitter to show their support for the Wales team after the match. Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, who is currently competing in the Tour de France, tweeted: "Well the dream is over... But the boys have done themselves and Wales proud!! Fought until the end!!" Former Wales player Robbie Savage wrote: "Well done Portugal the better team, what a header by Ronaldo, but the boys have made us all so proud of our country #cymruambyth." Manic Street Preachers, who wrote Wales official tournament song, tweeted: "Wales we still love you - you have made us so proud - it's been a beautiful dream - from the bottom of our hearts THANK YOU - xxxxxxx."	Wales' dream of becoming the first British team in 50 years to reach the final of a major tournament is over after they were knocked out of Euro 2016.

A 37-year-old man from Colchester, Essex, arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday, remains in police custody.	A woman stabbed to death at her home in Sheffield has been identified.
That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation hinges on the fact that since 2006, its UK business has been a subsidiary of its European headquarters in Luxembourg. As a result, anyone buying anything from Amazon in the UK makes a payment to the retailer in Luxembourg, with the profits taxed there rather than here. That is despite the fact that Amazon employs hundreds of staff in the UK, at several large depots, selling tens of millions of items each year to millions of UK customers. "Amazon EU serves tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages, dispatching products to all 27 countries in the EU," Amazon said. "We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation." Campaigners against tax avoidance arrangements - which are in fact quite legal - have taken a very dim view of all this. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said the government had turned a blind eye to this sort of thing and was even encouraging it. "I severely criticise our tax authorities for putting up with this sort of arrangement," he said. "It is part of our "open for business" agenda - we will let a multinational company do what it likes, so long as they put some jobs in the UK, but we won't ask for tax." In fact, HMRC has long had a specialist unit of 1,200 tax inspectors dealing just with the affairs of the 770 biggest companies. It is called the Large Business Service for firms with a turnover of Â£600mn or more, or assets of Â£2bn or more. "We can't discuss Amazon for legal reasons, but HMRC applies the tax laws as they apply to multinationals so the UK receives the tax revenues to which it is legally entitled," HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said. "Where there is a high risk of the UK losing out, we move our resources to challenge that risk," it added. When it comes to multinationals and tax authorities arguing about how much tax should be paid, and to whom, the arguments often last for years, frequently hinging on a concept known as transfer pricing. This occurs when a division of a multinational in one country charges a division of the same firm in another country for the supply of a product or a service. This is sometimes criticised as a technique in which artificially high charges are levied internally, with the aim of siphoning money from a firm's business in a high-tax country to a low-tax one. There is nothing new in this problem and the issue hit the headlines in the UK as far back as the 1970s. There is now a lot of legislation to stop transfer pricing being abused, but in the end, there may be no right answer to how much tax is owed by a firm, and a settlement can all come down to haggling. One tax adviser at a leading firm of accountants - who wished to remain anonymous - said it was wrong to suggest the UK tax authorities were just sitting on their hands, watching taxable income move abroad. "There are some very bright people at HMRC scrutinising these sorts of things, it is wrong to assume we are lax at policing this." Another commonplace technique for multinationals to lower their tax bills - a variation on the transfer pricing theme - is for the head office in one country to charge all the national subsidiaries a large fee for "management services", such as accounting. If the fee is legitimate, then it is an allowable expense and can be set against a national division's profits to reduce its tax bill, while cash is transferred from that outpost to the head office. Ronnie Ludwig, a tax adviser at Edinburgh accountants Saffery Champness, says the arrangement is commonplace. "It is perfectly legal for a company to levy a management fee on a subsidiary," he says. "The question is whether it is proportionate and reasonable in relation to the actual services provided - the companies will be asked by the HMRC exactly what they are doing to justify the fees," he added. For its part, Amazon says in its accounts that it may have to pay an extra $1.5bn in back taxes in the US if it loses various transfer pricing disputes with the tax authorities there, going back to 2005. Amazon's accounts, filed at the United States chief financial regulator, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also make it clear that is facing investigations of some sort from several other national tax authorities. "We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom [and France]," the accounts say. As a result, the company has set aside $229m to pay any extra tax bills that may now arise from these. "Everyone of these jurisdictions is going to be very jealous of its entitlements to get tax," says Philip Spencer, a tax partner at accountants BDO. "It is commonplace to have lots of investigations on the go at any one time." Multinational firms will inevitably look for a good central site to administer their businesses in a region, not just for a low-tax regime, but to get good staff and enjoy good communications. It all makes life easier. Philip Spencer at BDO points out that a key advantage of a country like Luxembourg is that it also has a good network of double-taxation treaties with other countries. These regulate the taxation of cash flowing from business activity in one country to another. "Luxembourg is very favourable, it has lots of these treaties, which help avoid having to pay tax in one country and then reclaim it if tax is also levied in a second country." A key feature in all this is that the internationalisation of business has been give a huge boost by the advent of the internet and online trading. And this has made life increasingly hard for national tax authorities to deal with. "What everyone is grappling with is e-commerce," says John Whiting, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). "Everyone can see that firms like Amazon are making a shedload of profits - the question is where the profits were made."	Has the giant online retailer Amazon managed, quite legally, to avoid paying any corporation tax at all to the UK in the past year?
But many of the people using the health service in England or Northern Ireland on Monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference. Why? Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1% increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. What is more, the offer is "non-consolidated", which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1% increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2%, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1% pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1% next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1% pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth ??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save ??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4% and 5% a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on "quick fixes" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10% during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40% of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a ??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid. Like all pay disputes, it promises to be a game of brinkmanship. But one in which the stakes could not be higher.	The words strike and NHS are enough to send a shudder down the spine of any patient.
The market research firm GfK conducted a one-off online survey of 2,000 people after the result was known. Its confidence index fell by eight points to minus nine, a drop not since seen December 1994. Less confident consumers tend to curb their spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the UK economy. It is also one measure watched by the Bank of England when deciding its next move on interest rates. Governor Mark Carney has already warned the UK's economic outlook is "challenging" following the decision to leave the EU. The Gfk survey also suggested that 60% of consumers expect the general economic situation to worsen over the next year, compared with 46% in June. Just 20% expect it to improve, down from 27% last month. The number of people who believe prices will rise rapidly in the next 12 months jumped to 33% from 13% in June. It also showed regional differences in the fall in confidence - with the north of England seeing a 19 point drop and Scotland seeing an 11 point drop. The south of England saw just a two point drop. The survey was run from 30 June to 5 July to capture the mood of consumers immediately after the referendum on 24 June. "Our analysis suggests that in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, sectors like travel, fashion and lifestyle, home, living, DIY and grocery are particularly vulnerable to consumers cutting back their discretionary spending," said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK. A separate survey indicated that retailers were already beginning to feel the impact. The BDO's monthly High Street Sales Tracker showed a strong start to June, with sales growing 3.8% year on year. That decreased throughout the month and by the end of June, after the referendum, sales had fallen by 8.1% compared with last year. Official economic figures from the Office for National Statistics that will reflect any Brexit impact will start being released in August.	Consumer confidence has seen its sharpest drop in 21 years after the UK vote to leave the EU, a survey suggests.
Alwyn Pritchard, 53, was riding his motorbike when he was struck by an Audi driven by Paul Wilson, who then fled the scene, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Wilson, 38, of Rassau, Blaenau Gwent, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and other charges. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years and disqualified from driving. Gareth James, prosecuting, told the court that when Mr Pritchard was hit by Wilson's car he was "catapulted 131.8 metres from the point of impact. He died from multiple injuries." Wilson, an experienced HGV driver, admitted drinking "a couple of pints of Peroni and two bottles of Corona" but claimed he had been driving at 70mph on the Heads of the Valleys road near Abergavenny. Mr Pritchard's daughter Carly said in a statement to the court: "I will never be the same, my family will never be the same. "He was a good, loyal, trustworthy man to his family, community and his job as a PCSO with Gwent Police." She added: "The hardest part about accepting dad's death is the knowledge that it was avoidable. "Dad is dead because a choice was made - a choice that Paul Wilson made to drive dangerously at an excessive speed whilst intoxicated and also leaving the scene. "The consequences of his actions have forever changed my life as well as my families. How could he leave our father at the road side to die." Wilson also admitted to failing to surrender and driving with excess alcohol. David Webster, defending, said: "Wilson can't undo what has happened. He acknowledges that he must be punished." Judge Tom Crowther QC said: "You had a passenger with you, it seems highly likely you were trying to impress your passenger." He added: "Mr Pritchard was a cherished husband and father." After the hearing, Insp Martyn Smith said: "The loss of Alwyn Pritchard is deeply felt within the community - among his friends and colleagues - but moreover by his family. "They have said although they're fractured by grief and pain, they're still held together by love." He had worked with the Usk Neighbourhood Policing Team for six years. Gwent Police Chief Constable Jeff Farrar described him as "a committed, kind and conscientious community support officer".	A drunk man who was driving his car at 119mph when he crashed into and killed an off-duty police community support officer (PCSO) has been jailed.
One of the most celebrated African-American broadcasters in the US was best known for moderating Washington Week in Review and for PBS NewsHour. Ifill had been absent for last week's election coverage due to ongoing health issues and had been on leave since May. "She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her," said a PBS NewsHour executive producer. "Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change," said producer Sarah Just. "She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum." At a daily news conference, President Barack Obama offered his "deepest condolences" from himself and the first lady. "She was a friend of ours, she was an extraordinary journalist, she always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession," he said. Ifill had moderated two vice-presidential debates as well as a Democratic primary debate last year. In 2004 she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and in 2008 between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Last year she hosted the primary debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Sarah Glover, the president of the National Associated of Black Journalists, expressed her condolences on Facebook, saying that Ifill "was a transformative voice among journalists". In 2013, after being named co-host of PBS Newshour, Ifill told the New York Times that she hoped she would inspire future minority journalists. "When I was a little girl watching programs like this - because that's the kind of nerdy family we were - I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way. No women. No people of colour", she said. Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS, said that Ifill's "contributions to thoughtful reporting and civic discourse simply cannot be overstated." "She often said that her job was to bring light rather than heat to issues of importance to our society. Gwen did this with grace and steadfast commitment to excellence", Mrs Kerger added. Before working in broadcasting, Ifill had worked as a print reporter for the Baltimore Evening Sun, the Boston Herald American, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. She died after a battle with cancer.	Veteran journalist and news anchor Gwen Ifill has died aged 61, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has said.
Rother District Council said the temporary RNLI lifeguard service would "reassure the public and advise on safety" at the East Sussex beach. It follows the deaths on Wednesday of the five men in their teens and 20s from south-east London. Relatives have criticised the lack of lifeguards at Camber. The men who died have been named by police as: Last month, 19-year-old Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz also died while swimming in the sea at Camber. Rother councillor Sally-Ann Hart said safety was under constant review but Camber had been categorised as a safe beach. "Having said that, the RNLI are providing a temporary service this weekend. "They are redeploying services from other beaches around the country to provide reassurance to visitors and holidaymakers in view of the recent tragedies, because they are horrendous. "It might well be that lifeguards may be deployed in the future when all the evidence is looked at as to what caused these deaths." Rother council previously said that beach patrols were on duty to advise beachgoers of potential dangers. But Mr Ravi's sister Mayura, 17, said the family was angry the stretch of beach where the men died had not been blocked off following Mr Da Cruz's death. Mr Ravi's brother Ajirthan, 19, said: "There weren't any lifeguards cruising around. "Because they would have quickly noticed these boys drowning, and could have at least save their lives." An online petition calling for lifeguards at Camber Sands has been signed by more than 7,000 people. The RNLI said the council had accepted its offer to provide five or six lifeguards on Saturday, Sunday and Monday between 09:00 and 18:00 BST who would work alongside the Rother beach patrols. The charity has said the five men could have got into trouble after failing to realise how quickly the tide would come in. It said it believed all five men fell into deep channels of water between sand-bars - mounds of sand created by wave and tide activity - which had been made deeper with the weekend storms. A sand-bar is a submerged or partly exposed ridge of sand or other sediment built up by currents in coastal waters that occur where waves break. They are usually made up of sand but can also involve other granular materials, such as shingle or even boulders. They are most pronounced in the heavy surf caused by storms. Sand-bars are the most common cause of rip currents, which are generated by waves breaking over them. The RNLI said that the sand-bars at Camber Sands were three feet deep and had been made deeper by the weekend storms. Satellite images of the area give an idea of how the sandbars create an uneven sea floor.	Lifeguards are to be deployed over the bank holiday weekend at Camber Sands, where five friends died during a day trip to the coast.
After a fifth-place finish in the 2015 MotoGP season-opening race in Qatar, the 22-year-old Honda rider finished more than 2.3 seconds ahead of Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso in Texas. Nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi was third on a Yamaha. Danny Kent, Moto3, and Sam Lowes, Moto2, became the first two GB riders to win on the same day since 1977. The last time that happened was in 1977, when Mick Grant, 250cc, and Barry Sheene, 500cc, won their races in Sweden. Leopard Racing's Kent won by over 8.5 seconds from Frenchman Fabio Quartararo, while Lowes held off France's Johann Zarco for his victory.	Spanish World Champion Marc Marquez won the Grand Prix of the Americas for the third successive year on Sunday.
The 75-year-old was recovered unconscious from the water at Tywyn, by a crew from Aberdovey RNLI Lifeboat at 16:14 BST on Saturday. He was flown to hospital by the coastguard rescue helicopter but later died. The girls were taken to hospital as a precaution. In a separate incident, three people including a 16-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, were rescued from the sea in Harlech at about 15:30 BST on Saturday. Harlech Coastguard team, Criccieth RNLI Lifeboat, North Wales Police and paramedics were involved in the rescue. North Wales Police warned people to take extra care in the sea and to avoid taking risks.	A man has died after attempting to rescue two teenage girls who got into difficulty in the sea in Gwynedd.
Media playback is not supported on this device The oldest fixture in international football is the first competitive meeting of the sides since 1999. With only one team guaranteed a place at Russia 2018, England top Group F after three games with Scotland fourth. Wayne Rooney returns to captain England with Scotland captain Darren Fletcher saying a draw would be a good result. The sides - who first met in 1872 - played friendlies in 2013 and 2014 but last played competitive matches in a two-legged play-off for Euro 2000 in November 1999. Scotland won at Wembley but England won 2-1 on aggregate. England Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate was put in charge of the senior team for four games following the departure of Sam Allardyce after only one match. Allardyce left following a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to "get around" rules on player transfers. Under Southgate, England beat Malta 2-0 and drew with Slovenia in World Cup qualifiers. After the match against Scotland, England meet Spain in a friendly at Wembley on 15 November. Asked if he wanted the job on a permanent basis, he said: "I'm really enjoying being in the role. "What happens to me is not important. We have to win this game for the country, and because we want to be top of the group and heading to [the 2018 World Cup] in Russia. "What happens to me is important to my family, but other than that it isn't the purpose of the game. I want the players to enjoy the football and play well. "My focus is 100% on the match and it would irresponsible and unprofessional for it to be any other way." Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland manager Gordon Strachan - who has faced scrutiny coming into the game - says he does not need to impress on his players the importance of the match. "My players are intelligent enough to understand the fixture," Strachan said. "I don't think I have to show them anything. "They know the fixture, everybody knows the fixture. It's known throughout the world. So I don't have to show them the importance. "The importance is not to become caught up in the emotion of the game. It's important to use your emotion and passion, to run further than you've ever run before, to jump higher than you've ever jumped, to concentrate more. "I don't think you get too emotional. If you get too emotional then you can lose focus. So we're looking for that emotion and passion to play better than we've ever played before." Media playback is not supported on this device The match at Wembley is a 90,000 sell-out, which is expected to include at least 14,000 Scotland fans. "It doesn't get much bigger than this - there will be a little more fire in the belly, it being England v Scotland," Scotland captain Darren Fletcher said. "Every time you lead your country out it is important but there is no bigger stage than Wembley in front of 90,000 fans." England midfielder Jordan Henderson, who captained the team against Slovenia, said: "It is a massive game. If you look at the history of the fixture, it's not a normal game. "We watched a video of a lot of the past games. There was a few I can remember, especially Paul Gascoigne's goal at Euro 96. "The lads know the importance of the game, not only because it's England v Scotland but also because we want to qualify for the World Cup." Henderson also addressed criticism that England are a team lacking in leadership. The Liverpool captain told BBC Radio 5 live: "Everyone's entitled to their opinion - I've learned that over the years - but it doesn't really matter what other people think, it only matters what the team thinks and what the manager and the management team think. "They are the only important opinions that matter to us. I know there are leaders in the team, I know we've got great characters so that isn't a question in our dressing room. "The question is can we got out there and perform at the highest level to win the game. I'm confident we can." Media playback is not supported on this device New tennis world number one Andy Murray is expected to be among the huge Scotland support at Wembley, with Fletcher confident his side can be inspired by Murray's rise through the ranks. Murray became the first British singles player to be world number one since computerised rankings began in 1973 last week. "For us, he is an inspiration for what he has achieved in tennis," said Fletcher. "His never-say-die attitude, looking to keep improving and battling for a number of years against arguably some of the greatest tennis players of all time and to keep driving himself forward to try to improve those small margins. "He has fought to be the number one tennis player in the world so we can take inspiration from him as a sportsman, showing that there is no real ceiling on what you can achieve if you dedicate yourself. "If you have real dedication and desire, you can achieve almost what you wish." The Football Associations of England and Scotland have said they will let players wear black armbands with poppy emblems as the game takes place on Armistice Day. Fifa believes that could breach football's rules on displaying "political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images" and has warned the countries could face sanctions as a result. Both FAs said they are willing to face any punishment - though they insist it will not come to that. Media playback is not supported on this device "We're just pleased everything was resolved last week, that we can honour the sacrifice of those who have gone before us," said Southgate. "It's part of our identity as a nation." Henderson added: "The poppy is very important for the country and the players to remember what those people did for this country, the sacrifice."

At least five members of an oil exploration team were killed, a spokesman for the University of Maiduguri said. Soldiers and members of a vigilante group also died in the ambush. The high number of casualties will be a blow for the government, which insists the insurgency is all but defeated. At least 20,000 people have been killed and thousands more abducted since Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009. In the most notorious abduction case, it seized 276 girls from a boarding school in the north-eastern town of Chibok in 2014. It has since freed more than 100 of the girls, in exchange for the release of its fighters detained by Nigeria's security forces. Details of what happened on Tuesday remain unclear, with initial reports from the army suggesting the abducted geologists and surveyors, who worked at the University of Maiduguri, had been rescued. On Tuesday, the army said the bodies of nine Nigerian soldiers and a civilian had been recovered. But now the university has said at least five members of staff, including two academics and a driver, were killed when the heavily armed convoy made its way back to Maiduguri, in north-east Nigeria. Several others remain missing. "We got the impression our staff on the team were rescued because that was what the military spokesman said yesterday," Maiduguri University spokesman Dani Mamman said, quoted by AFP. "But we were shocked when we were given four dead bodies. This means it  wasn't a rescue. We still have other staff that are yet to be accounted for." Sources told the BBC that more than 40 people, most of them soldiers and volunteers from a vigilante group, had been killed in total - although other sources suggest the number killed may rise further still. "The death toll keeps mounting," a source told AFP, adding: "More bodies are coming in."	More than 40 people have died during an attempt to free people during an ambush by militant Islam group Boko Haram, sources have told the BBC.
But on Monday the Church of England broke a tradition inherited from the first Christians 2,000 years ago when the three houses of the General Synod voted to allow women to be bishops. Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. "Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift," she says. "It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it." A senior figure on the "high church" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents "a massive shift" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. "It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society", he says. "There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before.  It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again." Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: "This is a show for the media.  It's the end of the Church as we know it." The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. "It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place." Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. "There will be an 'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes," says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. "But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question.  Will there be trust?" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he would not truly be a priest. High Church traditionalists will look for alternative male bishops who have been ordained by a man, and who have not themselves ordained women as priests. With the tide of opinion in the Church, and in wider society, running against them, traditionalists are being offered much less than they wanted. After the legislation is passed, and if Parliament approves it, the new law will be "promulgated" by the Synod in November. Committees looking for bishops for the vacancies in Newcastle, Oxford and Peterborough could then interview women candidates. Senior bishops elsewhere might more quickly appoint a woman in the more junior role of assistant or "suffragan" bishop. Other Anglican churches already have women bishops - there are 20 in Canada, Australia, the United States, Cuba, India, New Zealand, Swaziland and South Africa. The Church of Ireland, which covers Northern Ireland, appointed Rev Pat Storey, as the first woman bishop in the UK in September, 2013.	Not for more than 20 years has the future direction and character of the Church of England turned so profoundly on a single vote.
Around 150 countries are meeting in Kigali to try and agree a speedy ban on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases. HFCs were introduced to limit damage to the ozone layer, but cause much greater levels of global warming than CO2. However nations are divided over the speed and timing of any phase-out. Concern over a growing hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica saw the Montreal Protocol agreed back in 1987. The key aim was the removal of gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which scientists had determined were causing the destruction of ozone, which protects people and animals from the dangerous impacts of ultraviolet radiation. Found in hairsprays, refrigeration and air conditioning, CFCs were ultimately replaced by factory-made hydrofluorocarbons, which essentially do the same job but without the damage to the Earth's protective layer. The substitution worked. Earlier this year, scientists said that the ozone hole is showing "the first fingerprints of healing." There has been just one unfortunate side effect caused by the solution. HFCs are several thousand times better at retaining heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. HFCs have helped the ozone layer, but exacerbated global warming. As well as being destructive, they are also the fastest growing greenhouse gases - increasing demand for air conditioning in emerging economies has seen the use of HFCs up by 10-15% per year. Scientists, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have warned about the warming dangers of HFCs. Unusually, governments took heed and have sought an international approach to phase out all these chemicals. This move has been given added urgency in the wake of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperature rises this century well below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. The scale of HFC growth is adding greater urgency say experts. After a year of negotiations, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase out these chemicals is expected to be agreed at this meeting in Kigali. "It's a big piece, these are the fastest growing greenhouse gases right now, although they are still a small percentage," said Durwood Zaelke, from the Institute for Government and Sustainable Development (IGSD). "But an amendment could bend the curve down quickly and take out 100 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by mid century, and by the end of the century you'll avoid up to half a degree of warming." There are dozens of replacement gases emerging including natural alternatives like ammonia, hydrocarbons and ironically, CO2. Refrigerators based on these coolants are already available in some developed countries. A new generation of short-lived refrigerant chemicals called Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) are also coming on stream. However countries meeting here in Kigali are divided over the speed at which existing HFCs should be phased out. Around 100 nations including the US, EU, African and island states are pushing for a peak in their use by 2021. India, a large manufacturer of the gases, favours a much later date of 2031. "The Montreal Protocol has a good track record of getting things done quickly and efficiently," said Gaby Drinkwater from Christian Aid. "We would hope that there would be an ambitious baseline and an early freeze date for all parties concerned. The earlier the freeze date the better for the planet." There is a lot to play for. An early peak means a far greater impact on temperatures  - but it will cost a lot more in funding to help poorer nations adapt. The hope is that by having an early phase down, emerging economies will not take intermediate steps but go for the most advanced and sustainable options. Unusually, industry and environmental campaigners are fairly well aligned on the need for an early phase out. Governments and private donors are willing to step into the breach and last month offered $80m to speed the transition. There is also a hope that newer coolants will also spark more efficient cooling devices. "If you increase the efficiency of your room air conditioner, you can double the climate benefits of HFC phase down," said Durwood Zaelke. "So private funders have said this is a very good opportunity, and they have put together a fund that is designed to be a bridge to greater sources of funding." Ministers arrive in Rwanda on Thursday to lead the negotiations to a conclusion. There is still much detail to be agreed. However, in the light of the imminent ratification of the Paris agreement, and a new deal on aviation emissions, there is added pressure for the Kigali talks to succeed. "A meeting like this has its ups and downs, we will go through that cycle," said Durwood Zaelke. "We just want to land on the up, that's the key." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Cooling chemicals that play a key role in refrigeration and air conditioning are likely to be rapidly phased out if delegates can reach agreement in Rwanda this week.
Charlie Walker's deflected free-kick put the hosts ahead, before Giorgio Rasulo's shot doubled the lead. Grimsby then took a 3-2 lead with goals from Padraig Amond, Omar Bogle and Nathan Arnold, before Rhys Browne fired in an equaliser for Aldershot. But Jon Nolan's cross went over Shots keeper Phil Smith and into the net to earn the Mariners all three points. The result keeps Paul Hurst's Grimsby side third in the table, seven points above sixth-placed Braintree. Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey: Media playback is not supported on this device "I am just disappointed with the goals we conceded, but I thought the first-half the players showed that commitment and desire. The passing football we like to do and like to play made us score two great goals. "In the second half we still played some good stuff and the boys still worked hard, but lapses of concentration in our box cost us. "The players know who they are picking up in the box. Phil Smith has held his hand up for two goals and feels he could've done better, which is credit to him, but it's lapses of concentration." Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside: Media playback is not supported on this device "First-half going in at 2-0 was very concerning because I asked them some questions and they were quiet. "To drag themselves back into the game and get in front and then have the disappointment of going 3-3, but clearly there was some luck in the end with the winning goal from Jon Nolan. "We've certainly earned some luck, we haven't had it recently and I'm hoping that's a change in that fortune. What a fantastic three points and reward for the fans that were not happy at half-time as we all weren't."	Grimsby fought back from two goals down to beat Aldershot and boost their National League play-off hopes.
The facility, based on the town's Crichton estate, is due to open in the next 12 months. The centre will be used primarily to research ways to improve responses to weather-related emergencies such as flooding. A report to the council's policy and resources committee will give a full update on progress to date. Initially the facility will have up to six staff. Last month, the Scottish government gave assurances that plans to develop the centre remained on track. It followed concerns from Dumfriesshire Labour MSP Elaine Murray about the pace of progress on the project, since it was first announced in August last year. A report to the council says it is essential the renewed impetus is maintained. To that end working groups are being set up, and council and government officials are exploring the best location and office arrangements for the centre.	Councillors are to be given a progress report on plans to develop a national resilience centre in Dumfries.

The East Riding of Yorkshire Council refused planning permission for the scheme at North Ferriby, near Hull, in May 2013. The developer St Modwen appealed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Greg Clark, who has rejected the plan. The company said it was disappointed and is considering its options. The Melton Fields project would have consisted of 510 houses and a care home. The company also applied for permission for an alternative smaller scheme of 390 homes. Villagers mounted a campaign against the development, with more than 1,200 people writing letters objecting to the plans. East Riding council rejected both proposals claiming the land had been earmarked for employment rather than residential use. The developer appealed against the council's decision to the government's Planning Inspectorate, which held a public inquiry last year. Councillor John Mabbett, vice chairman of North Ferriby Parish Council, described the secretary of state's refusal as "a victory for common sense". "Had this ill-conceived development been approved our community would have been overwhelmed by its size and the fabric and character of the village would have been harmed for ever," he said. A spokesperson for St Modwen said: "We firmly believe that our proposals for a residential development represent the most viable option for the site, and for the region. "Our proposals would not only deliver much needed family homes, but also bring important investment and jobs to the local area."	The government has turned down plans to build more than 500 homes near an East Yorkshire village.
The water pipes in the town are old and prone to leaks and bursts, Severn Trent Water said. Part of Milford Road is expected to be closed until the summer as a metal water pipe is replaced. Diversions will be in place. The road is "just too narrow" in parts to be kept open as large machinery will be used, a spokesman said. More than 12 miles (20km) of new water pipes are being laid from the Shugborough area into Stafford town centre. In the first phase, which began in September, pipes were installed on Tixall Road for a new housing development nearby.	The second phase of a £15m project to upgrade the water and sewer pipes in Stafford is under way.
The French authorities say the Airbus A310, which set off from the Yemeni capital, should not have been allowed to fly, the AFP news agency reports. Most of the 152 people killed in the crash were French citizens visiting relatives in the Comoros. There was just one survivor - a teenage girl who was rescued from the sea. Many of the passengers were travelling to the Comoros, but had begun their journey in Paris or Marseille on another jet operated by the national airline of Yemen, before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa. An association of the victims' families, AFVCA, has welcomed the charge. "It's a great relief for the families of the victims who have waited four and a half years," a spokesman for the association told the BBC. "Now the company will finally be forced to face up to its responsibilities." Yemenia has previously said that bad weather - strong winds and high seas - was the more likely cause of the crash. The carrier is not included on the current European Union list of banned airlines. The crash caused anger amongst the Comorian community in France as people complained that the aircraft had been in poor condition. The plane was banned from French airspace after inspectors found numerous faults in 2007, according to the then transport minister, Dominique Bussereau. Several European countries had also found a number of problems when they inspected Yemenia aircraft prior to the crash. Officials from Yemen have previously said the plane had undergone a thorough inspection and conformed to international standards.	France has charged Yemenia Airways with manslaughter over a 2009 crash off the Comoros Islands that killed 152 people, judicial sources say.
Media playback is not supported on this device Ali Crawford missed a hat-trick of chances for Accies in the first half while Killie's Kris Boyd twice headed wide from close range. Souleymane Coulibaly's volley for the hosts just after the break was well saved by Gary Woods. Boyd fired into the net after connecting with an Adam Frizzell shot but the striker was flagged offside as both sides had to settle for a point. There was a familiarity about the manner in which Accies enjoyed periods of dominance and yet failed to capitalise. It is a characteristic that has haunted them throughout the early part of the season and has cost them points on several occasions. Media playback is not supported on this device So it proved again in east Ayrshire as a combination of poor finishing and good goalkeeping denied them a breakthrough. And though a point away from home might prove valuable in the final analysis, a win would certainly have been more welcome. Accies were culpable of a lack of composure and accuracy in front of goal, with the normally reliable Crawford skewing shots wide or hitting tamely into the keeper's arms. Rakish Bingham missed arguably the chance of the match when he headed wide of goal from inside the six-yard box. But Accies were not the only team guilty of profligacy in front of goal. Kilmarnock - and Boyd - in particular passed up good chances, with the striker heading off target from good positions on a couple of occasions. He was also caught offside far too often, notably when tapping Frizzell's shot into the net. When the strikers did find their shooting boots, both keepers earned their corn with some excellent saves. Woods kept out a controlled Coulibaly volley and also denied Frizzell late in the game, with the Kilmarnock substitute making a good impression from the bench. Jamie MacDonald, so often a hero for Kilmarnock, did superbly to tip Greg Docherty's goal-bound header round the post. And he did likewise with a Massimo Donati long-range volley in added time to ensure the game ended in a stalemate. Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "It was a good point when you consider Jamie's made a fantastic save right at the death. I don't think we deserved anything more - Hamilton have had their fair share of opportunities. "We've blown a big opportunity to get ourselves into the top six going into the international break and feel good about ourselves. "In comparison to where we were in our last two home games and where we were against Inverness and St Johnstone, we didn't play enough on the front foot and we let Hamilton's shape cause us too many problems." Hamilton manager Martin Canning: "I thought we deserved to win the game on opportunities created but if you're having one of those days when the ball's not going to go in for you, you need to keep the back door shut. "I thought Dougie Imrie should have had a penalty [in the first half] - he's wrong side of the defender and I don't see why he would go down as he's driving across the box. "If we continue to perform to a high level, I've no doubt we can win games." Match ends, Kilmarnock 0, Hamilton Academical 0. Second Half ends, Kilmarnock 0, Hamilton Academical 0.

Friend, who cut his face, was treated in the tunnel before being taken to hospital, where he stayed overnight. The incident happened as the first half came to an end at the Vitality Stadium. Friend was due to take charge of Southampton and Sunderland on 5 March but concussion protocols mean he will not now do so. The start of the second half was delayed by five minutes as Friend was replaced by Dean Treleaven, a qualified referee who was watching the match. "I was on the bench and he came to us and he fell against the dugout, with his nose, and then fell to the ground," said Saints boss Ronald Koeman. "For maybe five seconds, he was out of everything." Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, whose side won 2-0, added: "I saw him collapse. I saw him very dazed and shaken."	Fourth official Kevin Friend has been released from hospital after collapsing and hitting his head in Tuesday's game between Bournemouth and Southampton.
Launching its general election manifesto, party leader Leanne Wood said she wanted an "end to austerity". Ms Wood said the four Westminster leaders offered "nothing more than further swingeing cuts" to voters. Plaid says it will negotiate jointly with the SNP and the Greens if there is a hung parliament. Plaid Cymru wants the devolved Welsh government funded to the same level per head of population as the Scottish government - which it says amounts to £1.2bn extra a year. At the party's launch event in Bangor, Ms Leanne Wood accused the UK parties of giving "no commitment to securing an economic recovery for all". Plaid wants to restore the 50p income tax rate for earnings above £150,000, increase National Insurance contributions for higher earners and put a tax on sugary drinks. Ms Wood also pledged to create up to 50,000 jobs by awarding more public contracts to Welsh firms. Main pledges Plaid's manifesto contains plenty of familiar territory but there's no mention of the £1.2bn which is repeatedly referred to by Leanne Wood as the extra funding Wales needs to achieve parity with Scotland. It talks about the creation of an independent commission to resolve funding issues in future. Elsewhere, there are plans to reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax. Independence is not mentioned until page 36 out of a 64 page document, and then only briefly.	Plaid Cymru has promised more cash for Welsh public services, an extra 1,000 medical jobs and to scrap taxes for 70,000 small businesses.
Chase, who was mid-way through a four-year deal at the end of this season, was revealed as a 2016 signing by Leigh on BBC Radio Manchester, although the deal has not been formalised to date. The 29-year-old had already been granted a free transfer by Salford. He was suspended internally by the club in September pending the hearing. Media playback is not supported on this device The 2011 Man of Steel, who missed the final four games of the season because of that suspension, joined the Red Devils from Castleford for 2014 and scored seven tries in 17 league games in 2015. The New Zealand-born half-back qualified for England on residential grounds in 2011 and has since gone on to win 11 caps, but has not featured since losing his place to Gareth Widdop for the 2013 World Cup semi-final defeat by the Kiwis. Chase was banned for seven matches in April for a dangerous throw on Huddersfield forward Brett Ferres, but also showed off his skills during the campaign, notably with an assist for a Josh Griffin try against Hull FC.	England playmaker Rangi Chase has had his contract terminated by Super League side Salford Red Devils following a 'disciplinary procedure'.
The 23-year-old midfielder was signed a year ago after being released by Hull City, but an ankle injury restricted him to only 13 league starts last term. "It's been a frustrating few months with the injury but I am 100% fit now," he told Crawley's website. "It [the contract] gives me the opportunity to hit the ground running in pre-season and hopefully impress the manager enough to get another one." Henderson, who began his career at Arsenal, played only one first-team game during his year at Hull and was loaned out to Stevenage. "This is a fresh start for Conor," said Crawley manager Mark Yates. "I know he has a lot of ability and he has the chance now to show what he's about."	Conor Henderson has agreed a new six-month contract with Crawley Town.
The Yomper statue is currently located in front of the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney. The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and "belongs" at Eastney. The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992. The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a Â£13m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it. An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was "now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial". Sheila Mackie who set it up said: "The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space." Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a "clear preference" that the statue remain where it it is. Its motion stated: "The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney." NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum. "He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. " He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.	Plans to move a statue depicting a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict away from Portsmouth seafront have been criticised.
The 31-year-old has been without a club since leaving English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, where he spent nine years. He did not play at all for Tottenham in the 2014-15 season and spent the previous season on loan with Queens Park Rangers. "Officially at St Etienne so happy - back in football," he wrote on Twitter. Assou-Ekotto has not played for Cameroon since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil when he was involved in an argument with his team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo and even appeared to headbutt him.	Cameroon defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has signed a one-year deal with French Ligue 1 side St Etienne.
The 32-year-old Irishman is accused of striking Dundee United striker Aidan Connolly in the face with his elbow. Goodwin was not pulled up for the offence during United's 3-0 win. Should he accept the ban, the midfielder would miss three games from 15 November because of an additional suspension due to his recent record. Goodwin has until Wednesday to respond to the complaint, with a hearing set for Thursday. He was banned for two matches last season for elbowing United midfielder Stuart Armstrong. This came after United released their own footage of the incident in the match at St Mirren Park.	St Mirren player-coach Jim Goodwin has been charged by the Scottish FA with violent conduct and offered a two-match suspension.
The 17-year-old posted a picture of Thomas Mair on Facebook the day the MP died, praising him for his actions. But he told the court earlier: "Even if we do consider someone an enemy, I don't think they should be murdered." The boy, who was arrested after posting pictures of a homemade bomb online, denies the preparation of terrorist acts and a count of making explosives. For live updates and more stories from across Yorkshire Mrs Cox was murdered by Mair on 16 June in Birstall, West Yorkshire, just days before the EU referendum in which she had campaigned to remain in the EU. The boy from Bradford posted the picture with the caption "Thomas Mair is a HERO". He also wrote: "We need more people like him to butcher the race traitors." However, asked by his barrister Rupert Bowers QC if he stood by his comments, he said: "No." Under cross examination, he said: "At the time I was writing this I probably did agree with Thomas Mair and expressed it in an edgy way." Prosecutor Barnaby Jameson then asked why he had used the term "race traitor" in his post about the MP's murder. Referring to an article about Mrs Cox's humanitarian work, he said: "She was more interested in bringing refugees over here and things abroad." Leeds Crown Court has heard the defendant, who cannot be identified because of his age, is a member of neo-Nazi youth group National Action. He was asked about another social media post from June 2016 featuring German soldiers defending the Normandy beaches with the words "let us remember the TRUE heroes who gave their lives on D-day". The defendant replied: "I was being edgy I guess." The judge, Mr Justice Goss, asked: "Is this intended to convey your view that the Germans were the true heroes on D-Day?" "No," he replied. The jury was shown video clips of the defendant dressed in a German military uniform talking to people online via the social network Omegle. The videos show other users reacting negatively to the defendant's outfit and comments. He told the court he also wore a Donald Trump t-shirt in order to offend people he met online. He went on to say he did not believe the Holocaust had happened and that if a woman was pregnant with a disabled child "it shouldn't be born". Mr Jameson asked if his opinion on disabled people was "in accordance with Nazi policy?". "I guess," the boy said. The trial continues.	A teenage terror suspect who branded MP Jo Cox's killer a "hero" has told a jury he no longer holds that view.
The government introduced fees in 2013 to reduce the number of malicious and weak cases, but that led to a 79% reduction over three years. Trade union Unison argued that the fees prevented workers getting access to justice. The Supreme Court also found fees were indirectly discriminatory to women. It ruled tht the government was acting unlawfully and unconstitutionally when it introduced the fees. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: "This is absolutely a tremendous victory, it's probably the biggest victory of employment rights in this country." Fees ranged between £390 and £1,200 to get a case heard at a hearing. Discrimination cases cost more for claimants because of the complexity and time hearings took. The Supreme Court found this was indirectly discriminatory because a higher proportion of women would bring discrimination cases.	Fees for those bringing employment tribunal claims have been ruled unlawful, and the government will now have to repay up to £32m to claimants.
Craig Harvey, 31, denies assaulting consultant radiologist Marcel Strauss at Wishaw General on 24 February. He is also accused of assaulting a prison officer and wrestling with three others before trying to escape from the ultrasound department on the same day. Mr Harvey pled not guilty to all the charges during an appearance at the High Court in Glasgow. It is alleged that he repeatedly struck Dr Strauss on the arm with a blade, which was attached to a piece of plastic, to the doctor's severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Prosecutors also say that he assaulted prison officer James Muncie when he was "in lawful custody" and that he tried to detain the guard against his will in a toilet while holding the razor blade. The charge further alleges that Mr Harvey demanded the prison officer remove his handcuffs and attempted to strike him with the blade before struggling with him, which resulted in Mr Muncie striking his head. It is also claimed that he struggled with three other prison officers and attempted to escape from their custody in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. Mr Harvey faces a third charge of being in possession of a weapon. He is due to stand trial on 27 September at the High Court in Livingston.	A prisoner is to go on trial accused of attacking a doctor at a hospital with a razor blade.
It has also been told to stop breeding orcas in captivity in a ruling from the California Coastal Commission. They gave the park permission to double the size of its orca enclosures on the condition that breeding and bringing in new whales stopped. It comes after criticism of the way the whales are treated there, something SeaWorld has always rejected. Animal rights activists have welcomed a ruling by the California Coastal Commission, an agency that makes big decisions on major building projects in that area of America. SeaWorld had put in plans to spend $100m (Â£65m) to expand its orca facility, which the commission approved. But their decision came with several conditions. SeaWorld cannot add any new whales from the wild to its San Diego tanks, and none of the 11 orcas currently at the park will be allowed to breed there. SeaWorld said it was disappointed with the ruling. They issued a statement that said: "Breeding is a natural, fundamental and important part of an animal's life and depriving a social animal of the right to reproduce is inhumane." Groups that have criticised the park said they were pleased with the decision. The group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: "The commission's action ensures that no more orcas will be condemned to a nonlife of loneliness, deprivation and misery." The breeding ban will not apply to the 13 other whales at SeaWorld attractions in San Antonio and Orlando.	SeaWorld has been banned from bringing wild killer whales to its park in San Diego, America.
Josh Vela fired Bolton in front from eight yards after Emile Heskey laid Dean Moxey's long throw into his path. But Boro equalised when Rhodes, who was about to be replaced by David Nugent, drilled home from close range. Rhodes then headed in Middlesbrough's second stoppage-time winner this week from three yards. Minutes earlier, Boro's big-money transfer deadline day signing from Blackburn had hit the post and headed wide from six yards as the Teessiders sought a winner, while substitute Gaston Ramirez also scooped a shot over from close range. Relive Middlesbrough's win at Bolton But Rhodes was in the right place at the right time to nod in Nugent's cross in the first minute of injury time and leave Boro two points clear at the top after promotion rivals Burnley, who they face on Tuesday, won 2-1 at Birmingham. Boro, who have now won six successive games, also scored an injury-time winner to beat Reading in midweek and this late show secured only their second victory at Bolton's current home. Middlesbrough face promotion rivals Burnley and Brighton in their closing four games and, as such, have their fate in their own hands as they bid to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2009. Aitor Karanka's side dominated the first half in terms of chances as Stewart Downing hit the bar from 25 yards, while Adam Forshaw, Daniel Ayala, Albert Adomah and Ritchie de Laet all failed to hit to target. Mark Davies' backheel forced Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos into a save from Bolton's best first-half opening. Wanderers looked set for only their fifth win of the season after Vela put them in front but Rhodes had the final say to the delight of Boro's 4,302 travelling fans. Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: "I told him [Rhodes] after the game that a goalscorer can't forget to score goals in two months. "Always one day it would arrive that he would score goals and it was today - two important goals. "I don't think it's been easy for him. He's not a strong character, you can see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when you do your best and you're unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting himself. "Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the team." Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips: "That's [the level of performance] got to be the case from now until the end of the season. "We encourage players to get on the ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive edge and defensive shape. "There's still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set the players up for next season for those that are going to be here."

Alex Gray, from Perth in Tayside, is awaiting sentence after being convicted earlier this month of burglary and harassment. The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed "the system has failed him", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a "nuisance rather than a victim" by police, adding that the experience had left her "a changed person". Gray's mother Michelle said she had tried to get help for her son from the authorities for years. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain programme, she said: "I had no idea that he had been stalking Lily Allen and putting her through these years of torture. "We knew he had a fixation with her but not that he had actually been anywhere near her. "We just thought he had a fantasy in his head." What's the difference between a super-fan and a stalker? It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker? Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom. "I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset," she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats. READ MORE She added: "We knew he had a mental disorder and he had been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia two years ago and he was meant to be on medication for this, but nobody was ensuring that that was happening. "It escalated after his dad died. He got worse and we knew he was getting worse. We tried to get him help and nobody would help us at all." His sister Kaylie Gray said: "I don't think it's going to be good for either party - for Alex, for us, for her (Allen) - if he just goes to prison because he's not going to get any help. "He's just going to continue to get worse and then he's going to get released without any help and we are just back to square one again." Asked if Gray had shown any remorse, his sister replied: "No, Alex is a very closed book. "He doesn't like to talk about anything and because of his disorder he thinks people are tapping phones, so he won't talk to me about things like that over the phone." His mother added: "He finds it hard to... separate what's real and what's not real, it's part of his illness, I think." Kaylie Gray said the family has not had any contact with Lily Allen. She added: "We are really sorry that it got this far. It's horrendous what her and her family have had to go through and obviously we feel so horrible for her." In an interview with The Observer, Allen said: "Until he gets the right treatment and the right help he needs, then I'm not safe. "You can throw the book at him, put him in jail, but he'll still be coming out. And the victim is never safe." A Metropolitan Police spokesman would not comment on Allen's case but said they took stalking and harassment "extremely seriously".	A man who stalked singer Lily Allen for seven years "needs help, not jail", according to his family.
Matt Denton, from Hampshire, estimates his "very expensive toy" has cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds. He says a mining company and a marine research organisation are now interested in his design and he hopes it might be used at science fairs. During its development the machine had one outing, at a music festival, where Mr Denton says it was well received. "It's an entertainment vehicle," he said. "But I hope it will inspire people." The project was only initially intended to take 12 months, Mr Denton, who usually specialises in small-scale animatronics for the film industry, said. "After 18 months we tried the model out. We had to completely strip out and rebuild the legs. They were too heavy and complicated. "I'm a software and electronics engineer so this was out of my area - I had to learn fast." The robot, driver-operated by joysticks within a cockpit, can only travel at 1.5km/h (1mph) and manage a distance of 5km on a 20-litre (4.5-gallon) tank of diesel. "It's not about miles to the gallon, it's about gallons to the mile," he said. "It wasn't built to be efficient and fast. It was built to look cool and insect-like and fun." Mr Denton said he was inspired by science fiction to create the "walking" machine. "But legs are very inefficient - the wheel was invented for a reason," he added.	A giant-mantis robot with hydraulic legs has been unveiled by a designer who spent four years creating it.
The Office for National Statistics said the quantity of goods bought between April and May fell by 1.2%, which was worse than economists had expected. Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were up by 0.9% - the weakest annual growth rate since April 2013. The ONS said that higher prices across all sectors "seem to be a significant factor in slowing growth". Data showed that average store prices rose by 2.8% over the year, which the ONS said was the largest increase since March 2012. One of the key factors behind the rise in prices has been the fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum, which has increased the cost of imports. Non-food stores were the main contributor to the slowdown after reporting an annual sales fall of 1.2%. However, food retailers reported growth of just 0.1% - the slowest since July 2013. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: "It's hard to see the trend in retail sales improving soon. Retailers have not finished yet passing on higher import prices to consumers, wage growth looks set to remain depressed and banks are reporting that they intend to restrict the supply of unsecured credit." Keith Richardson, head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: "Shoppers are actually tightening their belts, switching to supermarkets' own-brand products, while the discounters are also enjoying renewed growth. "They're also prioritising their spending, with non-food sales suffering so that consumers can still afford to put a treat in the trolley when buying their groceries." The gap between wages and inflation is continuing to widen. Data released on Wednesday revealed that average earnings fell in real terms by 0.6% in April compared with same month last year. Inflation stands at 2.9% - far above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank is due to announce its latest interest rate decision at midday. While it is not expected to make any change to rates, investors will scrutinise the minutes from the most recent meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee for clues about inflation.	Retail sales fell in May as shoppers began to feel the effect of higher inflation.
The Germany midfielder ran onto a lofted pass from Lucas and, with his back to goal, hooked a volley into the top corner. With Jurgen Klopp's side sitting in third, it could prove to be a valuable goal as they push for Champions League football - but was it the goal of the season? Media playback is not supported on this device "We scored a fantastic goal," Klopp said. "Actually, I would love to see it again - everybody is speaking about it. "I only saw it once but it looked already pretty nice. I turned a little early and didn't see it hit the back of the net. "He is a good boy, a good player and he deserves it," added the German manager. Liverpool have not been strangers to special goals this season - with midfielders Jordan Henderson, Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum all winning Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition. With 11 goals in 100 career league starts, Can is not the most frequent goalscorer, and the player admitted himself that his strike at Vicarage Road was his best to date. "I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored," Can said. "I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much." Team-mate Adam Lallana, who made his return from injury as an early substitute, said that Liverpool players will be allowing Can to try more acrobatic efforts in training. "He does like to try speculative efforts, and we will not have a pop now after he produced that," said the England midfielder. "It was a 'worldy' goal, worthy of winning any game. "Credit to him, he was brave enough to try it and it flew into the top corner." The goal of the season will be chosen at the end of the campaign. Tottenham's Dele Alli won the award last season for his strike at Crystal Palace, and the last Liverpool man to win the honour was none other than Steven Gerrard for his brilliant winner in the 2006 FA Cup final.	It was only his seventh Premier League goal since arriving from Germany three years ago, but Emre Can's sensational overhead kick was enough for Liverpool to beat Watford on Monday night.
The images, taken by Syd Shelton, from Pontefract, include pictures of The Clash, Misty in Roots and The Specials. The collection also features photos taken at the Rock Against Racism Carnival at Victoria Park, Hackney, which attracted a crowd of 100,000. The show runs from Friday to 3 September at the Impression Gallery. The Rock Against Racism (RAR) movement formed in response to controversial remarks made by Eric Clapton in 1976. In the following years, RAR staged marches, festivals and more than 500 concerts in the UK in a bid to fight racism through music. Shelton, who studied Fine Art in Leeds and Wakefield, said he became involved with the movement after returning to the UK from America in 1976. He said: "I was appalled at the state of race relations in Britain, in particular things like the Black and White Minstrel Show and the signs I saw in some windows saying 'No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish'. "It was a pretty serious situation and I always loved music and very quickly hooked up with the people that had set up RAR. "It was a bizarre mixture of people, photographers, graphic designers, writers, actors and, of course, musicians. "We were very lucky in the sense that we tuned in to that explosion of punk and UK reggae and brought the two together. That said more about what RAR was about than any of the slogans we may have shouted from the stage." He added: "I hope the exhibition shows that you can change things and you can actually take a stand, even in the most difficult of situations. "If it inspires people to be photographers that would be great but I hope it will also inspire people to fight against racism and inequality."	Photographs capturing some of the most important moments and inspirational figures of the Rock Against Racism movement are to go on show in Bradford.
Let's not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children's new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on. Am I right? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online: Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. "There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them," he says. "The chat room is like the foyer of a church." Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. "We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas," says Mr Parker. "The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity." The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. "Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians," he says. "The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. "It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world." You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one "Joseph Carpenter" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. "It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget," explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. "The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago." However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being "too religious". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. "We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much," says founder Roald Lidal. "One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan," adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. "There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga." As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. "I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters," says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. "The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly." "Jesus would definitely be on Twitter," adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. "He was a great communicator." Sounds like a seal of approval to me.	Nothing says Christmas more than watching that Harry Potter movie you've already seen 2,900 times, eating a mountain of lukewarm turkey and trying to work out where you're going to put all those new socks.
Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a "direct result of the injuries" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were "devastated and beyond shock at what's happened". "Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well," said Mrs McAllister. "We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters." Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. "This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners," said Mrs McAllister. "My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis." She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt "very angry" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. "We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response," she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was "yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days". He added: "We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. "We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life." The PSNI have also repeated an appeal for information on two cars that police believe may have been used by the bombers - a red Citroen C3 and a silver Skoda Fabia.	The PSNI has launched a murder inquiry into the death of a prison officer who died 11 days after being injured in a dissident republican bomb attack.
