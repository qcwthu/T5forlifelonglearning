Herbicides can be used to chemically control or kill weeds in your garden or lawn, but are typically species specific to the weeds that you have.Before purchasing a herbicide, refer to online encyclopedias to identify the type of weeds that you have.   Applying a chemical solution to your garden should be the last resort as it can pollute groundwater and can be bad for the environment.Weeds can be broken up into three classifications known as broad-leaves, grasses, and sedges and their life cycle can be annual, biennial, or perennial., Before applying herbicide to any weeds in your garden, it’s important that you read the directions and the label on the box it came with.Some herbicides may pose a threat to other plants, so make sure to read the warnings before applying anything in your garden or lawn. You should also determine if the herbicide is made for weed prevention, or for killing weeds once they are grown.  Wearing things like an apron, rubber gloves, protective eye-wear, and a face-mask will protect you from any herbicides that may inadvertently get on you.   Tyvek and nitrile gloves are the best material to use when handling herbicide and can be bought in hardware stores or online., Do not douse an area with herbicide, even if it has a lot of weeds, as this could be dangerous. Use the recommended level of herbicide according to the label.   You can visit a local cooperative extension if you have additional questions about applying herbicide to your garden or lawn, or having trouble choosing the correct chemical for the types of weeds that you have.	Identify the weeds that you have. Read and follow the directions on the label of the herbicide. Wear protective gear before applying the chemicals. Spray the herbicide to weeds and weed prone areas.
Search online for classes offered by your community center or find an acting studios in your area. If you have no background in acting, this is a great way to meet other actors and actresses and learn the basics. Call the studio to see when the next class cycle starts and determine if it’s in your budget.   A good studio will show you the basics first. Any studio or teacher who boasts, or worse, promises, they can make you a “star.” should be avoided.It may take years to develop and hone your acting skills, so don’t get discouraged if you aren’t a natural. Consider becoming an actress and focusing less on being famous.; , If your secondary education option offers it, drama is a good way to begin acting early on. Acting requires you to understand complex scripts, memorize hundreds of lines, and have the ability to perform in front of an audience. Taking drama in high school, for example, will give you an introduction into many of these key acting areas. Make sure to audition or register, depending on what’s required.   Famous Actresses can be stars of stage or screen. Voice only work is common too such as radio or movie voiceover rolls.Taking drama in school can improve interpersonal skills, as well as, mental, physical, and emotional development., Stage and screen acting are in very different environments.Stage acting is a performance in front of a live audience. You'll be given time to rehearse and learn lines more so than on film or in a television show. You’ll learn stage acting in high school drama, but some of these skills also translate to the screen.   Other differences include the ability to vocalize. Acting for television and film, utilizes microphones that are able to pick up minute sounds, while you need to resonate vocally on stage. Costume changes often have to occur much quicker with stage acting.  When looking for colleges or universities to attend, consider selecting an acting school. Some of the best schools for drama and the performing arts include The Juilliard School, Yale School of Drama, Carnegie Mellon University, and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.Many of the top drama schools require an audition in order to be admitted.Try building a strong portfolio and take all the roles you can get while you're in high school to increase your odds of getting into a performing arts college.The competition for admission is often very fierce and includes filing a lot of paperwork. , Don’t shy away from a role if a producer or director thinks you’re a fit for it. If your high-school drama teacher wants you to be the lead role in the play, take the opportunity. In order to build your skills and develop your talent, you need to actively perform in front of an audience.   You may have to perform in unpaid roles until you’re paid as a professional actress. Try to take roles that challenge you and will give you a greater diversity of skill.  Roles may require you to be in physically good shape to execute certain maneuvers or fit a certain image for production. Stage acting also takes physical prowess and endurance in order to continue vocalizing lines and doing actions on stage. By maintaining good physical health, you'll prevent casting directors from dismissing you because of the shape you're in.   You obviously don't have to be a size 0, but you need to stay healthy and be able of adapt your appearance. Getting sick may also halt production if you've been cast in a critical role. Make sure to take vitamins and maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Make sure to get enough sleep.  While it’s not necessary to learn how to dance, sing, or play an instrument in order to act, these skills will make broaden your range and make you more appealing to casting directors. See if you can take an extra class at a community center or get a special tutor to teach you these skills. Horse riding, archery, gymnastics, diving, martial arts, conjuring, juggling and circus skills are all performance skills that may increase your ability to become a famous actress.   Anna Kendrick, Kristen Bell, and Emmy Rossum can sing, dance and act.If you want to become a famous musical star, then singing and dancing are usually a necessary talents to have.  A great way to see your own progress is by taping yourself everyday to see how your acting skills are developing. Once you’re done with your scene each day, go over the tape and write notes on things that you can do to improve.Practice audition scripts at home, and get friends who act to help you.   Choose scripts in a genre that you find specifically challenging like comedy, romance, or drama, and practice them to hone your versatility. You can also do voice or movement specific exercises to improve specific aspects of your acting ability.	Sign up for acting classes or join a local acting studio. Take drama in high school or secondary school. Determine if you prefer stage, film or TV acting. Major in acting in college or another tertiary education option such as an acting school. Take opportunities to perform. Keep physically fit and active. Learn new skills like singing and dancing to widen your acting range. Practice frequently to hone your skills.
Be careful when using snail or slug baits as most commercial products contain metaldehyde which, when exposed to water, quickly breaks down to a harmless alcohol. (Fresh metaldehyde is toxic to slugs, snails, birds, cats, dogs, elephants, rabbits, humans and many more other creatures great and small)  , The other method is to spray with a systemic insecticide however this is always not effective as the insect is often gone when you notice the damage. If you have plants that are attacked it is best to remove them and replace with forms that do not suffer from Psyllids., Finally mulch well the soil around the base of the plant. The advantage of this method is eliminating the need to repot the plant every two years or so.  That is why it is important not to remove any rotted stumps/fallen timber (unless a nest for white ants) and puddles in your desire to obsessively tidy up. You should be aiming for retaining a wide diversity of habitats., It has been found that rainfall contains small quantities of dissolved nitrate and ammonia, which are forms of nitrogen, hence the growth spurt.  An example of this would be to pot on a plant growing in a 150 mm (6”) pot into a 200 mm (8”) or 250 mm (10”) pot size.  This is true because the potting mix can remain quite wet if there is no plant roots to take-up the excess moisture. This is especially so if the plant is potted on late into the growing season and their growth slows down, the roots can rot and you loose the plant. There are exceptions of course, like plants with a strong and quick growing root system (e.g. Prostanthera species). However, as a general guide follow this rule and you will increase your success when repotting plants.  Another sign will be when the plant needs daily watering in summer.  If you need large amounts of new “soil”, obtain it from a reliable supplier and make sure it is suitable for native plants., Sometimes when I plant new Grevilleas or Banksias they do not perform well and their new leaves are yellow. This is often a sign of phosphorous toxicity in native plants. Once phosphorous is present in the soil it takes a long time to leach out. So to lock-up the phosphorous and prevent the plant taking it up, water the plant with Chelated Iron as per the directions on the packet. At the same time, I usually water the plant with some trace elements just in case the soil is lacking in one or more of the minor elements.  If this treatment does not work the first time do it again in two weeks time.,	Snail Baits. Treat psyllid infected vegetation by cutting off the damaged growth. If you have soil that is too heavy to grow plants like Boronias then buy a large plastic pot, cut the bottom out of it place this on the ground (loosen the soil first) then fill the pot with potting mix and plant your plant. Apart from planting native plants, you will also be creating a habit style garden where native plants will play a part of the food chain for any animals and insects etc. Understand what the benefits of rain (versus watering) are. Repot into the next size pot up or maybe the next two sizes of pots. Do not repot pot plants on too quickly it is best to wait until grow slows and roots appear out of the drainage holes. The best option is to work with what you have got and improve your soil with your own home made compost. Yellowing of new leaves. Watch for the new growth – it should be healthy green. This treatment will not change the colour on old leaves.
You should definitely allow the group to make most decisions, but if you have certain requirements for the club (for example, if you just like to read science fiction or if you can only meet on Thursdays), you should set them out ahead of time.; , If you feel comfortable inviting people into your home, you can have at least the first meeting at your house or apartment as long as you have enough room. Otherwise, you can usually reserve space for free at community centers, libraries or churches, or you might try to get a bookstore to let you hold your meeting there. If you can find someplace convenient where you can hold regular meetings, the better.  Ask that people bring suggestions of books to read. Deliver copies of the flyer to local bookstores, and put them up on community bulletin boards at grocery stores, churches, etc. You can also advertise online on the community pages of sites such as Craigslist. Be sure to clarify that the purpose of the group is to discuss books, not to order books together at a reduced price. (CAVEAT: Please be aware that broad advertising of book clubs can result in the occasional bad apple that can single-handedly ruin the discussion openness and tone. Do this with caution.)  , For the initial meeting, this should include at least two items: a "Book Suggestions" page, where members can write down titles they recommend for the group, and a "Hosting and Refreshments" page where members can sign up for a date that is convenient for them to take these responsibilities. You also want to record the attendees names and contact details. A head count is not sufficient. For subsequent meetings, you'll also want to include a "Coming Soon" page or the reading schedule for the next two or three meetings. This clipboard should make the rounds at every meeting. This "clipboard" should be placed online -- some sites offer book clubs that ability to post meeting dates/locations, sent automatic meeting reminders, and add sign-up sheets for discussion leaders and sign-up sheets for refreshments. An online clipboard also allows members to add online reading guides and connect to book reviews. Also, a member should be chosen to send out an email with all the information on the clipboard; like what the next book will be, what was discussed, possible book club names, etc.  Make sure the meeting space is clean and inviting. Check to make sure the restrooms are properly stocked. Most importantly, make sure you have enough chairs, and set up refreshments.  Introduce yourself and try to make sure that each guest feels welcome and comfortable. Let them know you're glad to see them.  If some of your guests don't know each other, go around and have everybody introduce themselves. You may also want to do this at subsequent meetings if new members are in attendance. Ask that people tell the group a little bit about themselves and their reading interests. During the introductions, send the clipboard around so people can write down book suggestions and sign up to bring refreshments or, if necessary, to host.  Some issues to discuss are:   Do you want to set rules about the books, such as pricing or content? What are the members' expectations of the group, and what are their responsibilities as members? What is the group's policy on smoking, pets, tardiness, and telephone calls during book discussions? Are members allowed to bring their children if they don't have a babysitter? Some will not mind if children are present, others will. The tone of a meeting is very different if children are present. Can members bring a guest? Of course, this is the best way to build book club membership. Referrals and invitations from existing members minimize the aforementioned "bad apple." Can new people join, or is there a limit to the group size? The ideal size is less than 10 -- otherwise, people just don't have an opportunity to discuss and contribute.  The easiest way to do this is to simply pick a book yourself -- try to pick one, such as a current bestseller, with wide appeal -- but if you don't want to go out on a limb, you can decide as a group. Ask that members bring their own suggestions and any external reviews that may help inform other members of the book. During the meeting have members vote on the next three books -- which gives members some time to find and read the books.  This will make the book club more official and members will feel like they really belong. Don't just hastily choose a name though. Have the members suggest ideas and everyone vote.  Now that the really hard work is done, relax and let people talk and leave as they will. Be sure to speak to each person again so they feel more comfortable and invested in the group.	Decide on your requirements. Find a location for the initial meeting. Make and distribute a flyer.This announces the time and place of the first meeting and any other relevant information, such as whether refreshments will be served. Prepare a clipboard. Prepare the meeting space. Greet the potential members at the first meeting. Start the first meeting by stating the agenda and making introductions. Explain or decide how often, for how long, and where the group will meet and how much reading the group should generally get through from meeting to meeting. Decide on the first book to read. Make sure that you decide on a name by the end of the first meeting. Break out the refreshments and chat.
It doesn't have to be the latest version if your computer is older. Flight simulators will help you learn about the instruments and systems found in a typical trainer aircraft as well as make you familiar with maneuvers and procedures you will need to master for your private pilot exam. Thus you will need to spend less time and money on actual flight lessons, which are quite expensive. X-Plane's website truthfully says that if a flight simulator can save you an hour with a controller, it will have effectively paid for itself. Remember that while flight simulators are good for procedures training, they won't give you all of the stick-and-rudder skills to fly a real airplane.; , See if conditions match what those products indicate. That way, when you do fly, you'll have a higher confidence in the weather predictions.  This will make the airplane climb or stall if you pull back too far. Pitch changes speed, power changes altitude. ,, This will cause the plane to bank resulting in a left turn. You also need to add left rudder (the left peddle) to keep the plane coordinated. Same thing to turn right but use the right controls	Pick up a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator or Laminar Research's X-Plane. Check out weather products such as METARS and TAFs even on days you don't fly. Raise the nose of the airplane by pulling the control wheel toward you. Use the throttle control to help the airplane climb and control your speed.  , Push the control wheel away from you and reduce power to descend.  , Turn the control wheel left to raise the right wing.
This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:   Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects Flowers (these can be pressed and then used) Dried grasses Leaves Seeds and nuts, coconut shell ' straw, and others,etc.  If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.  Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.  Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.  Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.   If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a "glaze". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.  Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.	Find suitable items out in nature. Make sure that the items are dry before using them. Choose a suitable background. Design the collage. Glue the items in place. Allow to dry.
You must pick a burial ground that leaves you a window of time alone and out of sight in which you will bury your package. This window of time must be no less than an hour (longer if the package is large), and occurring at least once a week. Why? Because if you get into some hot water and need to retrieve the package as soon as possible, you don't want to have to wait around for a month until you can dig it up unseen. Tips for picking a spot include:   Make sure your spot isn't scheduled for construction or anything that might cause it to be built upon, dug into, or otherwise obstructed from your ever getting to it. A few examples of badly chosen terrain might be: an empty lot, a spot near a water main, a spot close to a public road or a playground/school. The spot must have ground that is easy enough to dig with a shovel. You don't want to be spending all night digging, and the use of large digging machines isn't conducive to secrecy! The spot must be easily found again without the use of a map. You should be able to find the spot in the darkness and completely by memory. Also, should the situation arise where you need to verbally convey to someone where your package is so that they might retrieve it (i.e. through a pane of plexiglass at a police station), you'll need to be quick and precise in your description. Don't pick a spot where your package might be moved by natural forces. A beach might not be the best idea as sand is moved to and fro on a daily basis. The same thing goes for a swamp. (Although you don't have to worry about moisture because your package will be more than watertight, as you'll read below) Don't pick an obvious spot. If somebody is searching for your package they should not be able to find it in your backyard. Pick a spot that has no ties to you or your family, friends, accomplices, etc.; , Your package must meet three requirements: a) Watertight, b) Structurally sound, and c) as compact as possible.   Do not use anything metal, such as screws or metal products. Robbers who may use metal detectors can easily locate your valuables through the detector. The following steps will show you how to create your package: First, take your object and put it into a heavy duty garbage bag. Use duct or packaging tape to completely cover the package two times over. This is the first step to ensure water tightness. Repeat three times for a total of four garbage bag/tape jobs. Your package is now watertight. Measure your now watertight package and construct a wooden box using wood panels one inches thick. Make certain your package will fit snugly inside of the box, so as to avoid creating a box bigger than necessary. Insert your package into the wooden box and repeat the garbage bag/tape job two times for good measure. You now have a watertight, structurally solid package that will last many years under the earth!  , During your window of burying opportunity, sneak to your chosen destination and dig. Dig fast and dig true; don't dig the hole any wider than is required, as you will be wasting time and energy.   For maximum security, it is recommended that you bury your package no less than 2 1/2 - 3 feet deep. It will take more time and effort, but your peace of mind over the years to come will be well worth it. Once your hole has been dug, place your package into it and cover it with a layer of good-size rocks. Spray some pepper spray or Mace into the hole. This will deter any animals from potentially smelling something interesting and digging up your package. In thirds, fill the hole with dirt, step into it and compress the dirt with your feet (so as to avoid a sinkhole in the following weeks), and use the pepper/mace spray. Repeat until the hole is full.  Dig up a nearby shrub and plant it on your spot, cover it with a rock, or plant some grass, anything to make it look like someone hadn't just been digging there.  Leave your package alone until you are ready to retrieve it. Don't check on it, don't poke at it. View it from afar if you have to, but don't go near it. If for some reason you do need to dig it up, don't put it back in the same spot. You've taken a big enough chance getting it into the ground the first time. Another attempt doubles your chances of detection.  Nobody is going to be impressed with the fact that you buried something, so don't show off. Unless it is imperative that someone else knows about your secret, keep it that way: a secret!	Pick your spot. Construct your package. Bury your package. Disguise the spot. Don't touch it. Keep quiet.
These movies typically take place in the American Midwest, and have a 95% chance of having Clint Eastwood in them.   If you see the name Clint Eastwood in the credits anywhere, prepare yourself for either a western movie or a film with terrible music.  If so, it's known as a spaghetti western. Movies like For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly are spaghetti westerns.   Although "spaghetti western" is a slightly derogatory term, remember that some of the most famous movies of all time were directed by Italian people.  If it's a pretty vast movie, it's probably an epic western. Use movies like The Magnificent Seven and Once Upon A Time In The West as a reference.  This is an outlaw film. Look to films like The Last Outlaw and Tombstone for an idea.  If so, it's most likely a marshall western. Movies like True Grit and Hang 'Em High fall into this sub-genre.  This is a revenge western. Look to films like Unforgiven, Django, and Django Unchained for help.	Identify Western movies. Find out whether the movie has an Italian director. Determine how large the scale of the movie is. Notice if any of the main characters are outlaws (typically the protagonist). Determine whether the film centers around a Marshal. Notice whether the protagonist's (or antagonist's) main motivation is vengeance.
Do some research on productivity levels and online browsing––the best way to convince your boss that online freedom for all is a good thing is to provide him or her with cold hard facts! You'll need tangible reasons and facts as to how unrestrained browsing will benefit employee productivity and corporate growth:   Use reputable studies, such as The National University of Singapore study, Impact of Cyberloafing on Psychological Engagement, by Don J.Q. Chen and Vivien K.G Lim. Print out the The Wall Street Journal article that discusses the results of this study:  "The researchers found that the Web-surfers were significantly more productive and effective at the tasks than those in the other two groups and reported lower levels of mental exhaustion, boredom and higher levels of engagement." "Because Web-surfing can aid productivity, the researchers caution employers against over-restricting workers' Web access. They recommend that managers allow time for limited personal Web browsing 'since it has a salubrious impact on employees' productivity,' while limiting access to personal emails."   Search for studies that pertain to your specific industry. For more credibility, search for studies that address your particular situation. For example, if you work in a bank, identify studies that have demonstrated increased marketability or employee productivity amongst banks when employees have been allowed to surf the net during their break or in order to research the competition. An easy way to dig up this kind of info is to go to http://scholar.google.com and search for "internet surfing employees bank" (replacing "bank" with your industry).; ,   What area of your job (and other positions at the company) could be enhanced by more online freedom? No doubt areas such as research, sales and marketing, clarification of legal and financial issues, etc., could be enhanced by unrestrained online browsing but so too can simply knowing what's happening out there with competitors and customers. Go through each department and determine if online browsing would be beneficial company-wide or in certain departments. Also, take into consideration any repercussions if the company were to allow online browsing for some departments and not others. Look at social media as a way of keeping up. Social media has fast grown as a source of immediate information that can provide feedback on the type of work your company is doing, what competitors are up to, and perhaps even things being said about your company itself. Having a finger on the pulse of what is happening in social media circles can be beneficial for some workplaces. Use a combination of common sense and studies when trying to convince your boss of the benefit of allowing free time to surf online at work. Some of the benefits will be relevant only to your workplace, while others will be broader for most people in office situations. Some reasons might include:  Employees will feel a greater sense of freedom and work and will therefore not get resentful about only using the internet for work reasons. Employees will have a "mental break" and return to working refreshed and more lively. Employees won't feel the need to sneak online to check their auction bids or to check the shopping specials. Openness is a good thing in the workplace and has a spill-on effect. Zoning out can restore intense concentration, which is better than forcing employees to work on relentlessly on the same items.  Identify which kind of online browsing is acceptable based on your research. For example, perhaps browsing news websites may be acceptable and helpful, whereas allowing employees to play popular social media online games may be detrimental. Maybe doing crosswords is okay, while multi-player shootouts is not.  Every story has its flip-side and you need to know what the boss might be thinking in response to your feel-good proposal. Honestly consider any negatives that could crop up as a result of having unbridled online surfing such as becoming addicted to online gaming, neglecting work or possibly viewing inappropriate sites. Another concern of many employers is leaving negative messages online in company time, or spats starting up online between employees or competitors. Make a list and compare and contrast positives and negatives. At the end of this list, add solutions that you think will work to help deal with the negatives.  Has a policy been established? Is it actually banned? It's important to know what you're up against before launching your persuasive techniques on the boss. If Internet use is banned, try to find out how long ago that rule was made, who made it, and why.	Make your case about the benefits of unbridled Internet access. Consider what benefits might occur if there were more freedom to browse online at your workplace, especially personal-type browsing. Pick your battles. Explore any negative aspects of introducing free and loose online activity. Review your company’s official policy on Internet surfing.
Depending on the plant, one or more techniques may be necessary. Ideal trimming is a compilation of several of the methods.   Pinching removes the terminal part of a green shoot before it is firm and woody. Pinch anytime, except late summer, by pinching or cutting an excessively long shoot so that side branching is promoted.       Heading back removes the terminal part of a woody branch all the way to the healthy branch or bud. Shape is influenced by heading back so the plant grows denser. Cut bottom buds to stifle growth and allow top buds to encourage growth.       Thinning occurs by cutting the branch at the point of origin of the parent stem to a branch that is lateral at the ground level, or at the Y of the branch section. Trim 1/3 the diameter of the branch to be removed. Use pruning shears, a saw or lopper to thin the tallest and oldest stems.       Renewal pruning, also known as rejuvenation, is the removal of the oldest branches to the ground, small stems and lively plants can also be cut back. This method can also include cutting all branches back to the same height every year.       Shearing is the cutting of terminal shoots with hedge clippers or shearers. Foundation plants tend to have this technique used on them but shearing should not be done when creating formal hedges. The natural shape of the shrub is destroyed when shearing is executed.      ; , Too little, too late or too often trimming can all have dire consequences for the shrub.   Gardeners wrongly wait to trim when the shrub outgrows the space it's currently located in. Other gardeners trim annually in the spring even if the shrub does not require cuts. Some gardeners neglect to trim until the shrub is overcome with diseased, dying or dead parts.  Timely maintenance prevents corrective trimming later. When shrubs are trimmed, plant health is reinvigorated and remedial trimming is averted.  Shrub health is maintained by trimming the diseased, dead or dying branches or wood. When portions of the shrub are not healthy, disease and insects enter through that weakened plant section and then may spread to other parts of the shrub. A trim is the best protection to prevent a shrub from becoming infected with disease.  If the portion of the plant is dying, diseased or dead, wherever the weakened shrub is located, it should be trimmed.  A sterile blade removes the hazard of infecting a shrub further with disease. The cut should also be made in the healthy portion of the branch rather than in the infected or dead area.  The blade should be dipped into a disinfectant of 1 part chlorine bleach for every 9 parts of water or 70 percent wood alcohol. Disease is spread if the blade is not disinfected after each cut.  This special effect borders on shrub preventative maintenance and art. Trial and error as well as practice and patience are necessary when entering the creative world of tree forming.  Shrubs that are damaged from construction work can also be refreshed with trimming. ,, Mature plants produce smaller flowers more often. Wood is reduced when trimming occurs. The lesser amount of wood prevents energy so that flowers are fewer but larger.	Know the 5 basic techniques of trimming shrubs. Learn how to trim a shrub correctly because the life and health of the plant is at stake. Prune regularly when the shrub needs upkeep. Remember that trimming includes pruning branches, removing flower buds, seed pods and roots. Cut the portion of the shrub with a blade that is sterile. Clean the blade after every cut. Aspire to create tree form plants or espalier. Stimulate shrub recovery when it is suffering from transplant shock through trimming.Eliminate low-growth of branches in case of nearby traffic. Thin branches so that sunlight reaches plants underneath the shrubs.  , Enhance the flowering of shrubs.
Face a mirror so you can watch as you practice. This is very similar to the method for how girls shake their hips, but for guys it will be less exaggerated and the move will be slightly different.This stance will provide stability as you perform the dance move. Standing in this position will help you use your core muscles to perform the dance move. You want to avoid using your back and leg muscles to swing your hips. The move will not look right and you could end up straining you muscles if not done properly.  You will move your hips along with your foot to the right side. Tuck your pelvis under. This will prevent your moves from being wide and exaggerated. Rotate your pelvis forward, then to the right. Rotate it towards the back, then to the left again. While you do this, keep your movements subtle and keep your pelvis tucked under. When a guy does a hip shaking move in dance, it is typically a smaller more understated move than when a girl performs this type of dancing. If you are doing this move correctly, your upper torso should stay still and in place. Your hips will not swing out dramatically to the side, but rather rotate in a small circle with your pelvis tucked under.  Step out a little with your left foot to start. Then move your hips toward your foot.Tuck your pelvis under and rotate your hips forward and to the left. Rotate the hips backwards, then back to the right. Keep your motions smaller and not exaggerated.  Combine the moves from the left and right to complete the dance move. Remember to keep your knees slightly bent and your movements loose.Tuck your pelvis under. Rotate your hips forward, then to the right. Then, rotate your hips backwards and to the left. Repeat the same thing on the other side, and return to your original position. Make sure your hips are moving independently. Your upper torso and chest should stay in place. If your hips are swing too far to the side, you probably aren't tucking your pelvis forward and under as you move. Think about how dancers like Usher and Michael Jackson move their hips. These are smaller, less emphasized motions than female dancers use, but are still full of energy!	Start with your feet shoulder width apart. Take a step to the side with your right foot. Repeat the process for the left side. Return your feet to the front, keeping your feet shoulder width apart.
Work a starting chain of 13 chain stitches.          You'll need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. If you do not know how to do this, see the "Tips" section for more detail. You can also check the "Tips" section for instructions on working a chain stitch.  Skip the first stitch of your previous row, then work one single crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.          When finished, this row should have 12 stitches. Check the “Tips” section for more information about working single crochets.  Work one single crochet decrease across the next two stitches of the previous row. Single crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the final two stitches of the row.          When finished, you should have 10 stitches in this row. If you do not know how to work a single crochet decrease, check the “Tips” section for instructions.  For the next row, simply work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row.          This row should have a total of 10 stitches.  Work one single crochet decrease into the first two stitches of the third row. Single crochet once into each of the next six stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the last two stitches of the row.          There should be eight stitches in this row when you finish it.  Work one single crochet into each stitch of the fourth row to complete the fifth row.          This row should also have 8 stitches, just like the previous row had.  Continue working rows with two single crochet decreases in them, separated by rows of nothing but single crochets. Repeat this for another seven rows, until you reach the twelve row.          Row six should have six stitches (one single crochet decrease, four single crochets, and one single crochet decrease). Row seven should have six stitches (six single crochets). Row eight should have four stitches (one single crochet decrease, two single crochets, and one single crochet decrease Row nine should have four stitches (four single crochets). Row ten should have two stitches (one single crochet decrease, one single crochet, and one single crochet decrease). Row eleven should have two stitches (two single crochets). Row twelve should have one stitch (one single crochet decrease).  The basic triangle is finished at this point. To smooth out the edges, work one single crochet into each stitch around the sides of the work and three single crochets into the gap at each point.          Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it to tie off the triangle. Weave the tail into the back of the work to hide it.	Create a foundation chain. Work 12 single crochets across the chain. Decrease twice in the next row. Single crochet in each stitch. Decrease twice in the fourth row. Single crochet in each stitch for the fifth row. Repeat this pattern for another seven rows. Single crochet around the edge of the piece.
; , This is usually behind a cabinet door, or behind a small piece of paneling screwed to the wall.  You should be able to see the water lines running to and from the water heater.  There should be either one or three valves.  Depending on whether you have a one valve system or a three valve system, here is what to do next:   One Valve System: Turn the valve to the vertical position. This valve should be on the lower line connected to the water heater. Three Valve System: Turn the top and bottom valves to the closed position (usually perpendicular to the line). Then turn the middle valve to the open position (usually parallel to the line).	Note the location of the water heater access door on the exterior of the RV. Go inside and find the inside access to the water heater. Open the inside access to the water heater. Count the number of valves on the water lines connected to the water heater. Follow the step according to the valve system you have.
When a shower head is in excellent condition, you should be able to remove it with your hands. If this is not possible, you will need to remove the shower head through other means. Before making any further attempts to remove your shower head, evaluate the fixture to determine why it is stuck:   Search for signs of rust—is there an orange or copper colored ring around the shower head’s connection to the shower arm? Search for signs of mineral build-up—is there a white ring around the the shower head’s attachment to the shower arm? If there are no signs of rust or mineral build-up, it is likely that your shower head is attached too tightly.; , Typically, if you are removing your shower head by hand, it is not necessary to turn off the water. Removing a stuck shower head, however, presents more challenges and risks. Therefore, it is advised that you shut off the water source. The water valves may be located in one of two places:          Under the bathroom sink. In the basement directly below the tub., Throughout this process, you will work with tools and chemicals that could damage your shower or tub. To prevent damage, cover the floor of your shower or tub with a thick work blanket. You will also handle small bits and pieces. To prevent the loss of parts, stuff a cloth down the drain.  Often, you can rely on simple tools, such as wrenches or pliers, to loosen your stuck shower head. When one method does not work, try the next method.          Cover the fixture’s connector or plumbing nut with an old cloth to protect the metal. Grip the connector or nut with a wrench or pair of locking pliers. First, turn the wrench or pliers clockwise in an attempt to break the rust or mineral deposits. Turn the tool counterclockwise to loosen and remove the shower head., Treating the rust and mineral build-up with chemicals may loosen the connector or nut.          Read the instructions on the bottle of rust, calcium, and lime remover. Apply the product as instructed. Allow the product to sit for the allotted time. Scrub off the product with a wire brush, removing the rust, calcium, and lime in the process. Wipe the shower head and shower arm clean., Penetrating lubricants, like WD-40 and Liquid Wrench, can work wonders on a stuck shower head.          Apply one coat of the penetrating lubricant to the connector or nut. Allow it to sit for two hours. Apply a second coat of the penetrating lubricant to the connector or nut. Allow it to sit for two hours. Cover the connector or nut with a cloth. Grip the fixture or nut with a wrench and attempt to loosen the shower head., Once you have removed the shower head, thoroughly clean the fixture to remove any rust or mineral buildup.   Place the shower head in a small basin. Pour white distilled vinegar into the basin until the shower head is completely submerged. Allow the shower head to soak over night. Rise the shower head by running it under cold tap water., Following the vinegar bath, examine the shower head for signs of rust or mineral-build up. If rust or mineral build-up is visible, apply a rust, calcium, and lime remover to the shower head.After allow the product to sit for the allotted time, use a wire brush to scrub off the product.         Always follow the instructions listed on the product.  Never re-attach a shower head to an uncleaned shower arm.          Peel off the old plumber’s tape from the shower arm’s treads. Use a wire brush or an exacto-knife if needed. If rust or mineral build-up is visible, apply a rust, calcium, and lime remover to the shower head. Allow the product to sit for the allotted time. Use a wire brush to remove the product and scrub off the rust, calcium, and lime. Use an old rag to wipe the shower arm clean., Applying plumber’s tape, or teflon tape, to the threads of the shower arm prevents leaks.         Wrap the shower arm’s threads with 2 to 3 layers of plumber’s tape in a clockwise pattern. Press the tape between the threads., Once the shower arm is prepared, you may attach your shower head. You may choose to reuse your old shower head or purchase a new fixture. There are several fixtures to choose from:          Attach a fixed-mounted shower head. This is your basic shower head. Place the shower head onto the threads of the shower arm. Use your hands to turn in a clockwise direction to tighten the fixture. Attach a hand-held shower head. This shower head is attached to a hose.  Place the shower mount onto the shower arm. Tighten the shower mount with your hands. Connect one end of the hose to the shower mount and the other end to the shower head.Tighten the connectors by hand. Place the shower head in the shower mount.  Once you have installed your shower head, turn on your shower’s water supply. Turn on the facet and check for leaks. Tighten your shower head’s connectors until the leak has subsided.          Add more plumber’s tape if needed.	Determine why your shower head is stuck. Turn off the water supply. Prepare your work space. Use a wrench or pair of pliers to remove the shower head. Apply a rust, calcium, and lime remover to the shower head. Apply penetrating lubricant to the shower head. Soak the shower head in a vinegar bath overnight. Remove any remaining rust or mineral build-up from the shower-head. Remove old tape, rust, and or mineral build-up from the shower arm’s treads. Cover the shower arm’s threads with plumber’s tape. Attach your old or new shower head to the shower arm. Turn on the water, check for leaks and tighten as needed.
Distribute these items around local art galleries and fairs.   Ask local vendors if you can leave some of your business cards with them or post a flier on their community bulletin boards. Consider contacting vendors that would have the appropriate clientele for your artwork. Also advertise at local restaurants and stores. This will will allow you to catch people of all interests.; , Those that are closest to you are your biggest advocates. Let your friends, family and co-workers know that you are selling your art.   Show them some of your favorite pieces so they can pass on first-hand information about your art for sale. Be sure to also give them some of your promotional materials so they can hand out your contact information.  Most communities host a variety of art fairs throughout the year. Research the various options and decide which one, or ones, would be most appropriate for the type of art you are selling.   For example, if you intend on selling paintings, go to one which highlights paintings in particular. Keep in mind that it often costs money to have a booth at these fairs, but consider the fee an investment in your business. Putting up a little money will likely pay off once you sell a few of your pieces.  If you know some people who may be intrigued by your work, host a small get together at your house or at one of their houses.   You can also host a private showing to only a handful of guests. Some people are more likely to attend an intimate event like this than an art fair. Ask all of those invited to bring a guest and, again, you are broadening your client base just by word of mouth.  Art galleries host events to show off new artists' artwork that can help you get your name into the art world.   Local galleries enjoy loyal and steady art lovers, making them ideal places to build a following. Even if you don't grab the attention of important art folk, you'll be spreading your name to those who may know said important art folk.These galleries also tend to have an established network of art promoters who love to support budding artists. Because they are often small, they tend to pay special attention to individual artists. They also will focus on bringing in interested collectors, practically advertising your work for you.While galleries are great, know that you aren't limited to them to showcase your work. Cafes, office lobbies, schools, and other places of business often host mini exhibitions from local talent.This is a great way of exposing your art to casual art fans; remember, not everyone goes to art galleries, but they do grab the occasional coffee. You'll most likely have to share a portion of the profit with the gallery. They are helping market your name, which does come with a price. Don't worry; this is a small price to pay for getting to share your work.  Showing support to your peers may prove invaluable when the time comes to host your own exhibit. It will also expose you to unique business opportunities and information.   When selling your art, remember it's all about who you know. Most cities have a local art council who promote and manage art events and exhibitions. These councils are known to give out funding to local talent, asking artists to partake in community projects or other such tasks.Your arts community may also have a website that posts regular job opportunities or small-scale commissions. They may also promote local exhibitions and shows. Stay current with these local channels to find lucrative opportunities.  Aside from art lovers and promoters, some businesses also love to be seen supporting the arts.It's not uncommon for artists to be brought up at a networking event. Try attending these events held by local businesses and distribute your business cards there. You may get contacted later with an interesting project. A business may also need help decorating offices, or require art prizes for their raffles. If you market yourself enough, you may also find yourself designing for websites and products that need to portray a certain image., Inform your local press about your exhibitions and inquire about whom you need to contact to get an editorial feature in your local paper.   Local media love to feature profiles of unique characters from the area.Since artists are often associated with terms like "unique" and "special," it will make sense for reporters and bloggers to cover you for a story. Every time you have an exhibition, you've won an art contest, or you've completed a new project, send out a little press release to the local media. You could even offer them free tickets to your exhibition. Don't be intimidated by the media. They're just normal people like you and me, and they may be eager to highlight up-and-coming talent. Being featured in local media will help you remain front-and-center in the local community's gaze.  Having your name associated to charitable, non-profit efforts may establish you as a trustworthy, recognizable name in your community. This will open you up to profitable opportunities.   Find a charity whose work truly inspires you and that you connect with. For example, if you love to paint dogs, get in touch with an animal shelter. Contact them and offer to work on their next event, free of charge. You could donate art to their raffle or offer to decorate their places of business. Most local charities already have a relationship with the media. Helping isn't just a nice deed, it may result in you being written up in the media as well. Giving back to the community is essential for building a loyal fan base that will continue buying and supporting your art.In November 2013, the Philippines was hit by a devastating typhoon in which millions of homes were destroyed. Wells Fargo began a charitable campaign in which they would donate $3 for every traced and decorated hand print they received. Many local artists took this opportunity to show their support and highlight their art in an altruistic manner., In the digital age, most business transactions are moving from the street to the computer. Visit the following websites for showcasing your art easily and with little cost.   Artpal.com is a free gallery for selling art. Their advertised products range from sculptures to jewelry, catering to a wide spectrum of artists. Artpal offers free membership, has a user-friendly website, and offers many features for selling your art online.Advertise your art on popular online merchants like Amazon or eBay. You'll only have to pay a shipping fee, and you'll get to appeal to a wide range of consumers. If enough people buy your work, your items may be linked to other popular items and listed as "People who bought this, also bought..." Make an offer on Craigslist.com. Craigslist advertises a broad range of things, from job opportunities to used electronics. Showcasing and selling your pieces to casual consumers will help you build confidence and turn a profit as you seek to gain exposure locally.  Selling art means becoming a business in-and-of yourself. Now that you've built a small following, give your fans a place where they can learn more about you and your work.   Use social media like Facebook or Twitter to link people back to your website. This way, your followers will know you can always be contacted at this place regardless of what online trends come and go.  Now that you've sold or showcased your work, establish a means of maintaining communication with important art folk.   Your database of supporters and investors can be your most powerful marketing tool. Make sure you have ways to inform them of your upcoming exhibitions. Acquire phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses as well.  Avoid selling your art through other channels if you have already worked out a deal with an art gallery. Many art galleries are hesitant to even share their contact info in the first place because they fear that artists will sell behind their backs.Be persistent when attempting to contact new prospects. It may take many attempts before you find someone willing to sell your art.  Every time you make new artwork or hold an exhibition, notify your mailing list.   Be sure you ask for permission to contact to your clientele. You want to provide them with meaningful updates, not unwanted spam. Contact customers personally whenever you have new artworks available, or when someone has bought a piece from you. Send letters expressing gratitude for purchasing your art. Remember, someone who has bought your art has expressed sincere interest and has made an investment in you. Failing to maintain contact with customers beyond the first transaction can come off as rude and dismissive.  Once you've got a steady following, determine who the constant supporters are among your fans. Offer them special treatment like opportunities to connect with you and first shots at purchasing your work.   If you paint murals, offer a small, free portrait of your fan's face. If you make t-shirts, give away free t-shirts in the mail. Show your supporters that your passion for art extends beyond money, and they might reciprocate this notion. Repeat customers are the foundation of a loyal fan base. They've already proven that they want to support you, and that they value your work. Show them that you appreciate their support and interest by giving them special treatment not offered to most followers.Remember, your best customers aren't limited to a set group of individuals. This number will inevitably grow as your following does. Don't be stingy with special perks; you want to keep as many people coming back for more.  Establishing social relationships with your investors beyond the art and business world is as important as building a loyal fan base.   Allow your investors to get to know you on a personal level. Sometimes, becoming familiar with an artist's personality sheds interesting insight on that artist's work. Don't be afraid to recommend your fellow art peers to investors. Who knows, maybe those artists will return the favor and recommend you in the future.	Make business cards and promotional fliers. Tell friends, family, and co-workers about your art. Display your art at a local fair. Take your art to interested patrons. Hold a local exhibit at an art gallery to display your work. Attend your fellow artists' exhibitions and art events. Get in touch with local businesses. Write or email your local radio stations, newspapers, and other publications. Partner with a local charity to showcase your art. Sell your art online. Register a website or blog on your own domain. Get the names and contact info from all of your supporters. Make a mailing list of all your local contacts and customers. Give your frequent supporters special perks and rewards. Set up frequent lunch or dinner appointments with potential and current prospects.
You may have to open a door, but you do not need to remove covers.; ,   For the screw-in type glass and type "S" tamperproof fuses:  If unable to visually inspect the metal link, use of a voltmeter, wiggy or neon test light should resolve the problem by following the steps below (they may also be checked via continuity test light, this procedure is detailed further below). While holding one probe or lead of the test equipment (meter, wiggy or light) to an unpainted exterior metal part of the fusebox, touch the other probe to the metal thread of the fuse holder / fuse. This is done by pushing the probe along the outside rim of the fuse until it contacts the aluminum or copper metal in to which the fuse screws in. If you get an indication of power (120 volts indication or lamp) this is not the fuse that has opened. Continue checking the rest of the fuses by removing the probe from the the fuse tested, and repeating the procedure for the next fuse. A fuse that does not test to 120 volts or does not fully illuminate the lamp, is a likely candidate for replacement (meters are always preferred over test lamps as a lamp may not provide enough of a change in brilliance that can be detected by eye). Remove the fuse in doubt by turning it counter-clockwise. If the fuse has ceramic or plastic threads and two small copper contacts under the head of the fuse, they are type "S" tamper-proof fuses. These fuses are a two piece protection system consisting of a threaded insert that is installed into the fusebox (like a regular glass fuse) and the the fuse itself that is installed into the insert. The fuses and inserts have different threads for the different values of fuses. The threads are such that they prevent installing a fuse with a value other than intended to protect the circuit (it is impossible to to put any fuse other than a 15 amp type "S" tamperproof fuse in a 15 amp insert, etc). The type "S" tamperproof fuse system removes the guesswork and danger of installing the wrong value fuses. The standard glass fuses, like the type "S" tamper-proof counterparts, are available in 15, 20 and 30 amps values. There are also 10 and 25 amp, but are not very common. To properly select glass replacement fuses, the cover of the fusebox should be removed. The 15 amp fuse is to protect #14 gauge copper wire, 20 amp fuse protect #12 copper wire, and 30 amp for #10 copper wire. These are the most common wire sizes in the fuse box. The #14 is the smallest wire connected to a glass fuse and the #10 is the largest wire connected to a glass fuse. There will probably only be (2) #10 wires, (4) #12 wires and the rest #14 wires. The #14 are used for general lighting and plugs throughout your house - except for those plugs in the kitchen, dining room, clothes washer & dryer. The #12 are for plugs in the kitchen, dining room, clothes washer and specialty or dedicated appliances such as larger room air conditioners, etc.. #10 may be used to feed an electric clothes dryer, electric water heater or another small panel elsewhere - garage, etc. These are estimates - all panels and homes differ, and this should only be considered a starting point. You will see larger wires connected to the MAIN and RANGE fuse holders, and possibly wires that connect to 2 terminals at the bottom of the fuse block. These are usually used for an electric water heater or small panel elsewhere. Don't worry if you don't see these wires.   For the cartridge fuse types:  Generally, cartridge fuses do not have any visual indicator when they open. They must be checked with a voltmeter "in circuit" or with an ohm meter or continuity tester "out of circuit". Many old fuse boxes provide for MAIN and RANGE fuse holders. The MAIN is designed for (2) 60 amp 250 volt fuses, and the range is designed for (2) 40 amp 250 volt fuses. With the fuses and the holders still in the fusebox, touch one probe to an unpainted metal surface of the fusebox. Locate the four small holes on the fuse holder, and press the other probe into the hole until it stops. Check for power indication. Repeat procedure for remaining 3 holes for this fuse holder. The holes align with the metal caps of the fuses, and should indicate power present at ALL four holes. Any hole without a power indication corresponds to an open fuse directly behind the hole under test. Check the orientation of the fuse holder by looking for the ON and / or OFF indicators in the middle of the short sides of the fuse holder. Remove the fuse holder by firmly pulling it straight out. Remove the fuse in question and replace it with a maximum of a 40 amp fuse for the RANGE fuse holder or 60 amps for the MAIN fuse holder. You must use fuses rated for 250 volts. Return the fuse holder to the fusebox observing the orientation of the holder (if you get it wrong, simply remove it, rotate the holder 180 degrees and reinsert).  A continuity tester is similar to a test light, but that this light has its own power source (battery) as part of the tester. It must never be connected to another power source - the way a neon test light would. Regardless of the method used (ohm meter or continuity tester), the procedure is the same, after preparing the tool for use.   Continuity Test Light and Ohm Meter Method  Set the ohm meter to Ohms (R x 1 or R x 10 scale) / Turn the continuity tester on. Put the meter probes onto the "Common" and "Ohms" jacks on the meter. Touch the opposite ends of the probes to each other. The meter should move to zero or close to it. Find the thumb wheel on the meter marked Ohms Adjust or Zero Adjust. Move the wheel to make the needle of the meter align with 0. The continuity light is checked by touching its probes together. The light on it should illuminate. Remove the fuse to test from the panel completely. All fuses must have a way for electricity to enter and exit. Cartridge fuses have these points at the ends of their body. They may be tested without removing them from the fuse holder. Placing the fuse or fuse in the fuse holder on a non-conductive surface, and touch a probe to each end. A zero reading on the meter or light on the continuity tester indicates a good fuse. Glass fuses have these points located at the center of the bottom of the fuse and the threaded sides (just like a light bulb). Touch the probes to these points to test the fuse. Again, we're looking for a zero reading or the continuity light to illuminate. Lastly, the type "S" tamperproof fuse points are the center bottom (like the glass fuses) and any copper contact point(s) on the underside of the top of the fuse.	Determine that a fuse has opened (blown) by inspecting the metal link through the glass. Figure out what kind of fuse needs replaced. As mentioned above, another method to check fuses requires a continuity tester or ohm meter.
,, If any large pieces of rust come out, you need to replace the tank. If only discolored then runs a little clearer, drain out a few gallons so there is enough drained to not leak when removing the rod., You probably will need an impact wrench with a 1-1/16" socket to break it loose. Use short burst to break it loose, then finish turning it out by hand., This way you don't have to bother with draining the entire tank, removing the plumbing, and tilting the tank., You can then feed it back in and flex it as needed., Tighten it up snug, but don't over tighten it., Then before turning on the power or gas, check for leaks around the rod. If it leaks, tighten it some more until it stops. If it doesn't leak then go ahead and turn a hot water faucet on to let any air escape. After it quits surging, then turn the power or gas back on.	Turn off the gas or electricity supply.Turn off the water supply to the tank. Open the drain at the bottom of the tank. It would be helpful to spray some lubricant such as WD-40 around the hex head of the rod, then let it penetrate a few minutes before trying to loosen the rod. If you don't have the clearance above the tank to pull the rod straight up, you can bend the rod as you are pulling it up. For the replacement rod you will need a segmented or flexible rod. Apply thread sealant to the threads of the rod before starting it back in. Turn the water supply back on.
You can buy comic-printed fabric from the fabric store.You can also buy a comic-printed shirt or skirt, and use that instead; make sure that the fabric is cotton and non-stretch.; , Fabric shoes would work best for this, because the glue will stick better. If your shoes are made out of patent leather, or a similar material, lightly buff them with fine-grit sandpaper or an emery board; this will give the glue something to grab on to.   If there are any embellishments on your shoes, be sure to cut them off; you can always glue them back on later.  The easiest way to do this would be to lay the fabric on top of the shoe, and then to cut around it.This method is just for one shoe. You'll need to repeat it for your other shoe. It is easiest to work on one shoe at a time.  Keep the fabric on top of the shoe and position your scissors just above the heel seam. Cut straight down the fabric until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the top of the opening (closest to the toe)., You can also use a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge, but make sure that it is waterproof.  Make sure that the fabric is stretched over the surface of the shoe, and that there aren't any puckers or wrinkles.  Try your best to follow the curves of the heels. Don't worry about the top opening just yet. When you get close to the heel of the shoe, stop.   You can leave the heels covered or uncovered. If you plan on covering them, skip over them for now; you will need to use a separate piece of fabric for that.  Pat some glue onto the heel of your shoe first, then press the fabric down onto the glue, making sure to pull it nice and taut., You are including this extra fabric so that you can fold it under itself and create a finished seam. Don't glue it down just yet, however., For a more secure finish, coat the underside of the fabric with glue first, then fold the raw edge under itself by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Brush on some glue under the fabric, then press it down onto the shoe., Go back to where you cut the slit, and cut the opening out until it is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edge of the shoe. Next, cut slits into the fabric. Make the slits further apart along the straight edges of the shoe, and closer together in the curved areas (such as the toe). This will help the fabric lay smoother inside your shoe, and prevent wrinkling and buckling, which might make your shoes uncomfortable to wear.If your heels are peep-toes, use a similar technique: trim the fabric down to ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then cut slits into it.  Many crafters find that the inside of shoes doesn't take glue well for some reason. To ensure that the fabric stays down, brush glue onto the shoe and the fabric, then press the fabric down. If the fabric still won't stay down, secure it with metal clips until the glue dries.   If your shoes are peep-toes, use a similar technique: glue the fabric down, then secure it with clips until it dries.  The easiest way to do this would be to run a craft blade down the seam between your shoe and the sole.This may even tuck the fabric into the seam.   If you have a lot of excess fabric, you can trim it away with a pair of scissors first.  Run some fabric glue along the seam where the body of your shoe joins the sole. Next, run something blunt along the seam to tuck the raw edges in. You can use your fingernail, a butter knife, a skewer, or even a knitting needle to do this., Start by measuring the height and circumference of your heel. Next, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the height, and 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters) to the length. Cut the fabric out, then do the following:   Fold the bottom and one of the side edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Cover the heel with glue. Wrap the fabric around it, starting with the raw edge and finishing with the folded edge. Keep the seam on the inside of the heel. Run a craft blade along the top seam of your heel to cut away any excess fabric. This should also tuck the raw top edges into the seam.  If your fabric has any glue "stains" on it, then coating it with Mod Podge or sealer would help hide them. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is waterproof.   It might be an even better idea to add 2 to 3 coats of Mod Podge or sealer. Make sure that you let each coat dry before applying the next.  Even though the glues and sealers you used are waterproof, it would be best to avoid getting these shoes wet. If you get them wet, the fabric may start to bubble and warp.	Get some comic-printed fabric. Choose a pair of plain high heels. Cut a piece of fabric big enough to cover one shoe. Cut a slit down the middle of the fabric for the opening. Use a foam brush to coat the toe area with a thick layer of fabric glue. Smooth the fabric down onto the glue. Cover the sides of the shoe with more glue, and smooth the fabric down into the glue. Trim one side of the fabric down until it goes ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the back seam, and glue it down. Trim the other side of the fabric until it goes 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) past the seam. Fold the raw edge under itself, then glue the fabric down. Shape the top opening. Glue the fabric inside your shoe. Trim the excess fabric away along the sole. Seal the fabric along the sole for extra security. Consider covering the heel area as well. Seal the fabric with Mod Podge, or another type of sealer, if desired.This may not be necessary if you used fabric glue, but it would be a good idea if you used Mod Podge. Let your shoes dry completely before you wear them.
Before you begin cleaning your smoking pipe, you’ll want to make sure it’s completely empty. Pour the used water down the sink and shake any remaining moisture out of the pipe. Remove the stem and set it aside for now—you’ll be cleaning this separately later.It’s a good idea to always refill your pipe with fresh water after every use.; , Turn the pipe under the stream as you rinse and let the water run through the top and out the opening for the stem. This will help flush out loose particles and wash away residue that hasn’t yet had time to fully set up on the walls of the pipe.   Hot water will help further loosen gunk and grime. Glass pipes will be slippery when wet, so be careful not to drop them.  Pour the alcohol in slowly through the top of the pipe. A good rule of thumb is to fill the pipe to roughly the same level as the water line. Add a couple spoonfuls of a coarse-grained salt like Epsom, kosher or raw sea salt. Aim for about a 2:1 ratio of alcohol to salt.Isopropyl alcohols with a higher purity (between 91-99% is ideal) will work best for cleaning and sanitizing. Salt that comes in large, coarse pieces won’t dissolve as quickly when immersed in liquid, making it more effective as an abrasive.  Place your thumbs over the openings of the pipe while you shake. As the solution sloshes through the pipe, the alcohol will kill any bacteria present and sterilize the walls of the inner chamber while the salt flakes scour stains and residue from the glass.You can also use another type of object, such as a cotton ball or cork, as a stopper for the openings.For especially dirty pipes, leave the solution to soak for about half an hour before you begin shaking.  Shaking the alcohol-salt solution through the pipe should take care of the worst of the buildup and discoloration. If any problem areas remain, you can deal with them directly by inserting a Q-tip through the one of the openings and scrubbing them by hand. By the time you’re finished, your pipe will be spotless.Depending on the size and shape of your pipe, you might also be able to use a pipe cleaner or toothbrush to spot-clean. Pipe cleaners are especially useful because they can bend around tricky corners and contours.  Clear away all the dirt and grime dissolved by the alcohol-salt solution. Don’t forget to wipe off the outside of the pipe as well to remove dust and fingerprint smudges. Blot the pipe gently with a microfiber towel, or leave it to air dry for a few hours before refilling it.If your pipe still isn’t clear after the first cleaning and rinsing, repeat the process using fresh solution.  After you’ve finished cleaning the body of the pipe, grab the stem and run some hot water over it. If need be, give the stem a preliminary scrubbing using a clean paper towel. Pay particular attention to the bowl, where the residue will be thickest and most stubborn.   Since the stem is so small and narrow, it’s easiest to clean it separately. Fortunately, this is even quicker than cleaning the pipe itself. Scrape the inside of the bowl with a toothpick or paperclip to chip away at thick residue that’s cemented in place.  Position the stem in the bottom of the bag, leaving the top open wide. The stem won’t hold water the way the pipe does, so it will need to be cleaned in a separate container.You could also use a lidded Tupperware container to hold the stem. Just make sure the material is not hard enough to break any delicate glass pieces. If the stem you’re using is comprised of multiple parts, disassemble it and clean each component separately to avoid damaging them.  Again, use about one part salt to two parts alcohol. When you hold up the bag, the stem should be completely submerged in the solution. Carefully squeeze excess air out of the bag and close the top. Double check that the bag is securely shut before you proceed.There should be enough space in the bag for the alcohol-salt solution to move around freely.If any part of the top of the bag remains open, you’ll end up with a big mess on your hands.  Grip the bag by the top and bottom and shake it from side to side. As you shake, massage the stem lightly with the tips of your fingers. This will create more friction to rub off persistent residue.For bowls that are severely stained or have a lot of buildup, let the stem soak for 15-30 minutes.Be careful not to handle the bag too forcefully, or it might leak or burst open.  Open the bag and pour out the dirty alcohol-salt solution. Retrieve the stem and wash it under hot water once more. Place the stem alongside the pipe to air dry.   Allow the pipe and stem to dry completely before using them. Lingering moisture can lead to mold growth and unpleasant odors, which can have an affect on the quality and flavor of the smoke., Use a light touch when holding or moving your bubbler to avoid an accident. This is especially important for pipes made from materials like glass and ceramic, which have a tendency to scratch and may shatter completely if dropped or mishandled. Repairing or replacing a pipe can be expensive, so the best way to deal with accidents is by preventing them altogether.Set your pipe on a small pad or coaster when it's not in use so that it doesn't come into contact with hard surfaces. Store your pipe somewhere where it won't be in danger of falling or getting stepped or sat on. Consider investing in a protective sheath or hard-shelled storage case if you smoke frequently or plan on doing any traveling with a breakable pipe.  The inside of your pipe is warm and moist, making it an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and disinfect your pipe regularly to fight off mold growth. Otherwise, you could be looking at slimy, discolored residue, foul odors and a generally unpleasant smoking experience.Refilling your pipe with fresh water every time you use it will help create a less hospitable environment for bacteria and mold. There's no good way to remove stuck-on mold other than by scrubbing it, which can be tricky if you have a small or oddly-shaped pipe.  Over time, ordinary tap water can leave unsightly mineral deposits on the walls of your pipe. These deposits may also contain traces of chemicals like chlorine and fluoride, which you definitely don't want anywhere near your lungs. By using filtered or distilled water, you can eliminate harmful contaminates from your pipe while also enjoying a purer, smoother smoke.For best results, you should also rinse your pipe with purified water after cleaning. Keep a pitcher of filtered water on hand so that you'll always have a ready supply when it comes time to refill your pipe.	Drain the dirty water out of the pipe. Rinse the pipe inside and out with hot water. Fill the pipe with rubbing alcohol and salt. Shake the pipe vigorously to clean the inside. Use a Q-tip to reach inaccessible spots inside the pipe. Rinse the pipe again. Wash and wipe down the stem. Place the stem in a small Ziploc bag. Fill the bag with alcohol-salt solution. Slosh the bag until the stem is clean. Remove and rinse the stem. Handle your pipe carefully. Keep mold from moving in. Prevent hard water stains.
As a general rule, weeknights are better than weekends. Narrowing down the best possible time can be a challenge in itself, though.   A meeting that starts at 7:00 to 7:30 PM gives your members just enough time to eat dinner with their families and may make it possible for them to get back home before bedtime if they have children. Meetings can start anytime between 6:30 PM and 8:00 PM if your target membership consists of single women or women without children. If you want members who are stay-at-home moms, you can also meet during the late morning or early afternoon when kids are at school. Think of a meeting that starts sometime between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM.; , Most book clubs meet about once per month, since a monthly meeting gives each member ample time to read each book. If you want your book club to be a little closer knit, you can also meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to discuss each book as you read it. Setting up checkpoints, such as having the first half of the book read within two weeks, can help keep members at the same pace.   If you do opt to meet on a monthly basis, you can stay in touch in between meetings via e-mail. Staying in touch with one another can be just as effective at building a stronger connection amongst your members as meeting in person each week.  Many women’s book clubs are meant to be a little personal, so meeting in one another’s homes can work wonderfully. If you or your members feel uncomfortable with this idea, you can opt to meet at a coffee shop or library.   Take turns hosting. If you do meet at one another’s homes, ask each member who feels comfortable or who has the space to hold a few meetings in her home. This prevents the stress from resting squarely on the shoulders of one or two people.  Whether buying bottled water and commercially packaged cookies or baking a fancy layer cake and brewing homemade iced tea, refreshments are a good way to get people to relax and open up. The snacks can be as elaborate or simple as you’d prefer, and you can also ask other members to contribute once your group gets established.  A women’s book club is a good way to make new friends, but if you keep the structure too loose, your club may lose its purpose. Make it a rule that each member must read the book before coming to club. You should also have some rule or guideline about how often each member must show up, and you should strongly encourage members to let you or someone else know when they cannot come.  The modern woman is a busy person, and knowing just how long a meeting will last can go a long way in encouraging her to come in the first place. Many book clubs meet for about 60 minutes, but you can trim that down to 30 minutes if your members are exceptionally busy or if you meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.  As your club members get closer, the temptation to talk about off-topic matters will almost certainly increase. You may want to schedule an extra 15 to 30 minutes before or after official book club business for members to chat and socialize about non-club matters.	Settle on a time to meet. Decide how often to meet. Choose the right atmosphere. Offer snacks. Keep things casual, but maintain a few rules. Give your members an idea of how long the meetings should last. Consider scheduling in a bit of extra time for socializing.
Do not soak or over-water the cutting or divided plant or it may rot and not take root. Water spray works well for many plants but take care with succulent and furry leaves. They are best only watered directly at the soil level, otherwise the combination of humidity and water may encourage fungal growth.  If you can feel resistance, you'll know there are roots. Most plants will root within 6 - 8 weeks, although some species of plants can take up to 12 months! Do your homework on the plant if you are not sure. Most common garden variety plants will root quickly.	Keep the soil moist. Pull the cutting or divided plant gently in about 6 - 8 weeks. Transplant to a larger pot or the garden when the seedling is well-established.
Maintaining the correct temperature is crucial on two fronts for composting. First, a higher temperature will help break down the compost materials faster. Second, the compost needs to get hot enough to kill any unwanted pathogens and weed seeds. Measure the temperature with a thermometer. Ideally, it will be no lower than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).If your compost is not getting hot enough, you can add manure or commercial products to increase the nitrogen levels and provide more heat.  Proper hydration will keep the compost from clumping into a hardened mess, or turning into a slush. The compost should stay about as moist as a wet sponge that has been rung out. If your compost is too dry, you can add water directly to the mix., Many composters will refer to green and brown composting materials. Keep in mind that this actually has nothing to do with the color of the materials or the compost. It actually refers to the carbon (brown) and nitrogen (green) content of the material. Your compost should be a dark brown., Your compost is ready once it has a dark brown color and all of the materials have broken down. It will have a similar consistency to soil. Empty the tumbler and use the compost in your garden or potted plants. It will provide nutrients that the plants need to grow.Some tumblers unload from the side. Others unload from the top or bottom.	Watch the temperature inside the tumbler. Keep the compost moist. Observe the color and consistency. Use the compost.
The majority of the supplies you need for this costume can be found around the house or purchased from a local general retailer. The template for your dog filter can either be drawn free-hand, or you could print a template for this costume from online. You'll need:   Card stock (white) Coloring utensils (like crayons or markers) Dog filter template Pencil (optional) Scissors Tape Wooden dowel (or long tongue depressor); , You can easily find and print a suitable template online with a general keyword search for "Snapchat dog filter costume template." Use stiff card stock when printing to prevent the costume from being too flimsy. However, if you don't have a printer or if you want to add personal flair to the template, to draw your own you should:   Look up a picture of the kind of dog you want to imitate. Some dogs have short, perky, triangular ears, others have long, floppy ears. You can even trace parts of this picture to make your hand drawn template. Use your pencil to draw out four separate dog features: two dog ears, a dog nose, and a large tongue. Add color to the features with crayons, markers, and so on to make the dog features look more realistic., Take your scissors and cut free the four dog features of your template or drawn design. After that, use your tape to attach the front end of the tongue to the end of your wooden dowel or tongue depressor.   To securely fasten your dowel or tongue depressor to the tongue printout/design, you may need to use several pieces of tape. By holding the wooden dowel or tongue depressor so the back end of the tongue meets your lips, you'll give the impression that the tongue is coming out of your mouth.  Use tape to attach one ear to both sides of the top of your forehead. Then use tape to stick the dog nose on the end of your own. All you need to do now is hold the tongue up to your mouth with your dowel or tongue depressor, and your costume is complete.	Assemble your supplies. Draw or print your dog filter template. Cut your design free and attach the tongue stick. Wear your costume and enjoy.
Choose a container with twice the diameter of the root ball, or with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the root ball and the sides. Good drainage is key to the survival of most bamboo species, so make sure there are sizeable holes in the base of the pot.Line the container with plastic root barrier if it is cement (which can damage bamboo) or wood (which lasts longer if protected from moisture).; , Bamboo loves humidity, which can make indoor growing a challenge. Keeping water under the bamboo without letting it soak the roots is the easiest way to add moisture to the air. There are two ways to set this up:Pebble tray 1. Fill a tray with a layer of pebbles. 2. Add a shallow layer of water to the tray. 3. Place the pot on top of the pebbles, without touching the water.  Gravel 1. Put a layer of gravel in the bottom of the pot. 2. Place the pot in a shallow tray of water.  Bamboo needs a soil with light to moderate density: fast-draining, but able to hold moisture. You can use a standard potting mix, or make your own from ⅓ loam, ⅓ perlite (or washed sand), and ⅓ peat moss (or well-rotted compost).Most bamboo can tolerate a wide range of well-draining soils, so the exact composition won't make or break your plants.You can use decent quality soil from your garden instead of potting soil. Avoid heavy clay soil, which drains poorly and is difficult to improve. Bamboo tends to do best in slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, but most species tolerate a pH up to 7.5.Most soil falls into this range.  Keep the stem and the top of the root ball above the level of the soil to prevent rot.Press the soil down to get rid of air bubbles, and water in the plant with a good soak.If your bamboo came rootbound, cut it out at the edge of the pot with a clean knife. It's probably had trouble getting water, so soak the root ball (but not the stem) for 20 minutes before planting., This is the most difficult part of growing bamboo indoors, since bamboo is both thirsty and vulnerable to overwatering.To start out, water until a little water runs out the base. Let the top 2 or 3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of soil dry out before each watering session. If the soil stays moist for more than a day or two, reduce the amount of water.If the top of the soil is drying out quickly, dig down to 4 inches (10 cm) deep to check for moisture. This depth should stay lightly moist most of the time, especially during the first three months after planting., Most bamboo plants prefer humid air, especially in hot weather.As long as you avoid overwatering, any one of the following should keep your plant happy:   Place the pot over a humidity tray, as described in the planting section above. Lightly mist the leaves with a spray bottle every couple days.Run a humidifier in the room. Keep plants close together (but be aware this increases the risk of disease).  If you know the species name of your bamboo, look it up to find specific recommendations. If your plant needs more light than your climate provides, install evening grow lights. If you don't know the species, start with these rules of thumb:Needs more light: –plants with small leaves –tropical species –plants kept in warm rooms  Needs less light: –plants with large leaves –temperate species during dormant winter periods –plants kept in cool rooms  , Bamboo grows quickly as long as it has room in the container, and needs extra nutrients to support this growth.A dose of slow-release fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season is a good way to provide a steady supply.You can use a balanced fertilizer such as 16-16-16, or a high nitrogen (N) fertilizer such as 30-10-10. The high nitrogen option discourages flowering, which weakens many bamboo species.Warning: –Do not fertilize within 6 months of buying. Most plants get enough fertilizer from the nursery.–Avoid seaweed-based fertilizers due to excessive salt content., Most bamboo is very tolerant of pruning, so don't hesitate to shape it once it is established and healthy:Cut withered, stunted, or excess stems (culms) at soil level. To prevent a stem from growing above a certain height, cut it just above a node (branching point). Thin branches regularly if you want to encourage vertical growth. Remove lower branches for aesthetics.  Bamboo can grow in two different patterns depending on species. "Runners" send out long shoots to start new plants, and will spiral around a large container within three to five years. "Clumpers" grow steadily outward, and may last up to six years in the same pot. Any bamboo plant needs a transplant to a larger pot once it becomes rootbound.To restrict growth, instead dig up the plant, cut away about ⅓ of the roots, and replant in the same container with fresh potting mix.You can propagate most bamboo plants by cutting the stalks and replanting in separate containers. This does not work on bamboo with no hole in the center of the stalks, or only a very small hole., It is fairly common for a bamboo plant to lose a lot of leaves when moved indoors or transplanted. As long as the new leaves at the ends of branches look healthy, the plant should recover. If those leaves drop or look unhealthy, a couple months outdoors (if climate allows) can help recovery.If your plant has been in the same place for a while, look into other possible causes:   Temperate species often drop leaves during low-light conditions. A cool, low-light dormant period in winter is good for these plants, and reduces leaf drop. The fewer green leaves there are, the less water the plant needs.Many species drop leaves in spring (or less commonly, fall), gradually replacing them with new ones. If there's a mix of green leaves, yellow leaves, and new, unfurling leaves, the plant is probably fine., If the sides of the leaves roll inward, the plant needs watering. (Photosynthesis consumes water, so the plant is reducing it by avoiding sunlight.) If the leaves droop downward, the plant is overwatered, or the soil is not draining fast enough.Overwatering is more dangerous than under-watering. Waiting to water until the leaves curl slightly will usually not harm the plant.  If your bamboo is turning yellow outside of the dormant season, this could mean several different things:   If they look dry and the tips are brown or curling upward, the plant needs more water. It may be rootbound and in need of a larger pot.Leaves that slowly become paler and more yellow usually have a nutrient deficiency. Add fertilizer with added minerals.A sudden color change after fertilizing points to over-fertilizing. Treat this problem by removing any remaining fertilizer and watering abundantly to leach out the excess minerals.  Indoor bamboo plants are more vulnerable to these problems, especially if there is low air flow in the room. If there is a light insect infestation, wash the leaves with insecticidal soap, or spray it outdoors with an insecticide spray.If this doesn't work, or if you think the plant has a disease, try to identify it and respond:   A black "sooty" mold is usually caused by insects. Remove aphids and ants.Circular fungus rings or grey/brown scale usually do not harm the plant. An anti-fungus treatment from a garden store can remove it.Wet, rotting patches are a sign of overwatering, but may be helped along by infestations. Dry them out and treat with insecticide or fungicide.Sticky white webbing may hide bamboo mites or other insects. Spray it off and apply insecticide. There are over 1,000 species of bamboo, so no one guide will cover all problems. If your plant has a disease that doesn't match the description above, consult a local garden center or university agricultural extension about disease in your area.	Find a wide, squat pot. Consider a humidity tray. Fill with well-draining soil. Plant your bamboo at a shallow depth. Water your bamboo carefully. Keep it humid. Find the right light level for your species. Fertilize your bamboo plant. Prune regularly. Re-pot or divide when the bamboo outgrows its container. Find the cause of leaf drop. Fix curling or drooping leaves. Respond to yellow leaves. Respond to insects and disease.
Avoid towels that have patterns on them, such as damask or stripes. They will compete with your embroidered design and make it harder to see.   If your design is dark-colored, choose a light-colored towel. If your design is light-colored, go for a dark-colored towel.; , This is important, especially if the towel is brand new. Terrycloth towels are made out of cotton, which will shrink the first time you wash it. You want to get rid of any shrinking before you add the embroidery.  You can use an existing design on your embroidery machine, purchase and download one online, or create your own using an embroidery-design program. Thicker, heavier designs work better than light, delicate ones. Great embroidery designs include:   Flowers and birds Monograms Damask and filigree Celtic knots and Chinese knots  , This will be your template. If you can't print your design, get the length and width of it, and draw a rectangle onto a sheet of paper according to those measurements. Cut the rectangle out.  A good way to find the center and axis on your template is to fold it into fourths, then to use the creases as your guides. Pin the template to your towel where you want the design to go, and make a small mark on the towel using a tailor's pen. Remove the template when you are done.  Spray the back of a sheet of cutaway stabilizer with removable adhesive. Press the stabilizer against the back of your towel, right where the design is.  Take the hoop from your embroidery machine. Set the inner hoop down first, then place the towel on top, stabilizer-side-down. Press the outer hoop down on top.   Machine hoops are a little different from the standard embroidery hoop.  Make sure that the excess towel is out of the way so that it won't get caught in the needle.  This will prevent the embroidery from sinking into the terrycloth. It will dissolve when you wash the towel. If you'd like to, you can run a basting stitch around the inside of the hoop to keep the topper in place., Use a size 11 or 75/11 sharp sewing needle. You could also use an embroidery needle instead.Make sure that all of your threads are in place.  Even though embroidery machines are automatic, you still want to watch it from time to time to make sure that it is behaving properly. This is especially important if you are working with metallic threads.   Each machine is different. How you set things up will depend on the type of machine you have. Refer to your machine's manual.  Once the machine is done embroidering, remove the hoop and snip off the excess thread. Pull apart the hoop and remove the towel. If you used basing stitches earlier, you will need to remove those first.  Use a small pair of scissors to carefully trim the topper away from around your design. Again, don't worry if it's not perfect. It will dissolve when you wash it.  Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) boarder) all around the design.Alternatively, you can also tear it away, but be aware that this may snap some threads and ruin your embroidered design.  Use a small pair of scissors to trim down any jump threads.Consider pressing the design with a hot iron. This will help set the stitches.If you'd like to, you can rinse away the water-soluble topper now, or wait until the next time you have to do laundry.	Choose a plain, solid-colored terrycloth towel. Wash and dry the towel. Plan your embroidery design. Print your design onto a sheet of paper, then trim it down. Place the template onto the towel and mark the center and axis. Attach a cutaway stabilizer to the back of the towel. Secure both layers with a hoop. Attach the hoop to your machine. Float the water-soluble topper on top of the towel and hoop. Set up your needle and threads. Set the machine up and allow it to embroider your design. Remove the towel from the hoop. Trim away the water-soluble topper. Trim the cutaway stabilizer away. Finish it up.
The monorail has two stops, Downtown Disney (across from the LEGO store, near Rainforest Cafe) and Tomorrowland Station (inside the Disneyland Park, between the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage and Autopia's tracks).  At Downtown Disney, a bag check is performed.  "Selfie sticks", used for cameras, or long stick attachments are prohibited from the park.However, camera handles that you can cover with your palm are acceptable.  The Downtown Disney entrance is treated as the main entrance, and you will be required to show an admission ticket or card.  If you are experiencing the "Extra Magic Hour" or "Magic Morning", you will also need to show your hotel room key (if applicable) to use the monorail. If you have entered the park earlier that same day, you will need to show your ticket along with a hand stamp.  The normal wait can be anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes, as peak traffic hours and two hours before closing can result in a longer wait, depending where you are at. Please be advised the monorail may shut down during special events, such as parades and fireworks, so plan your time accordingly.  Like the park rides, there will be park employees to control the amount of people riding each monorail. Each depot will have a "waiting area" and a queue line. Remember these are two separate "groups", so the people in the waiting area will be allowed to board the monorail, and thereafter people in the queue line will be able to enter the waiting area after the monorail leaves the station.  There's about five to six "sections" at each depot., The typical wait for a monorail is about five minutes., Moving trains may injure people. The monorail will keep the gates closed until they are ready to have members board. But just in case their safety systems fail (for some reason), just keep away from the train until the doors open and the exiting people stop exiting.  Never run into the monorail. , All passengers must be seated and stay seated for the entire trip duration.  The announcements will signal safety concerns in both English and Spanish.  The train will then begin moving slowly onward (forward).  It'll explain what part of the journey you're seeing underneath the monorail car.  You'll be surprised at what you see out the window. You'll see most of the exterior portions of the attractions leading up to the station as it circles around the inner portions of the park, and even includes a trip through Disneyland California Adventure Park.  Wait for the instructions and exit the monorail.	Research the locations the monorail can be boarded from. Prepare to complete a bag check. Have your ticket ready. Be prepared for a long wait. Walk up to the gates in the waiting area. Wait for the train to arrive at the station. Wait for the train to come to a complete halt. Walk up the train in an orderly fashion. Cross the platform onto the train itself.  , Prepare to immediately take a seat. Listen for all announcements, as they are being made. Watch the monorail doors as they close. Listen to the overhead narration in the PA system. Look down (if it isn't too dark). Allow the train to come to a complete stop when it arrives at the station.
Go out with friends, rent a boat, do whatever it takes to educate yourself with the different types, sizes and styles.; , Get to know your local boating locations and find out if they have any size restrictions. Then look for the size boat based on what you plan to do with your boat and where you'll be doing it. The larger the lake, the more turbulent the water conditions will be. Bigger boats make larger wakes. Combine that with wind conditions and you can be in for a rough ride. Bigger is not always better. If your interest is a smooth ride, a larger boat will do well. If your interest is wake boarding skiing and so on, a smaller boat may suit you better. Generally in the local lakes the size would be between 21 and 27 feet.  Cuddy cabin vs walkthrough. Normally the 21 to 23 boats are walkthrough bow riders and the 24 and above are cuddy cabin crawl through bow riders. This is a matter of suiting your needs most people think they will use the cuddy area and do not because its not the most comfortable place to be on a hot day, but it is a personal choice.  So far we have been talking about V bottom boats. The Deck Boat is gaining momentum in the performance boating arena. Deck Boats are usually 26' in length to about 29 but usually around 28'. You will find that the deck boat will give you the smoothest ride in choppy water. Compared to a V bottom in its size range. The Deck Boat will also give you the roomiest floor plan combined with more storage. This does not mean the deck boat is aways the best way to go. The turning radius as well as the handling on a turn is not in any way comparable to a v bottom's tight responsiveness. The twin sponson is the reason for the smooth ride as well as the inferior handling. Remember this, one boat is not better than another; just better for a specified purpose.  In purchasing a used performance boat it is not common to have a boat that is underpowered. Usually the performance market does not run V6 engines or 4 cylinders on these boats. Performance boats are usually over-powered. The question is what motor is best for the size boat your buying. A 21' to 23' boat will usually do fine with a 350 Mag Mercruiser Bravo 1 drive. Mercruiser is almost the only power plant used in the Southern California Performance Boat market. With a 24' boat to 29' boat you should expect a 496 or an 8.2 with a Bravo 1 drive. You may see a Bravo 3 drive (dual prop configuration). High performance motors may be impressive in speed runs but usually have a bit more mechanical risks do to harder run times and potentially added service demands.  First look at the boat; you can almost always tell if the owner is meticulous with their boat or not. Look at the gelcoat and see if there are scratches are all over. Look on the bottom to see if they beached it all the time. Look at the color of the gelcoat to see fading as it may have been kept out in the sun. Feel the vinyl for hardening and discoloration. Spring on the floor to feel a spongy softness which reveals water damage in the wood of the floor. If it's a fiberglass floor, the spring may be normal. Grab the drive and attempt to move it side to side, looking for play in the drive (make sure the steering wheel is not moving. Play is a bad thing, and the gimbal bearing could be costly to replace. Now as for the motor try to get records of the periodic maintenance, preferably once a year by a dealer not by the owner. Some boat owners do their own oil changes and assume they serviced the boat. Many times this results in costly repairs. Validate the stated hours with the hour meter and a computer diagnosis tool. You would need a Mercruiser mechanic for this. Remember the motor's computer has the actual running hours of the boat and is not easy to tamper with. An hour meter can be replaced anytime along the way. If possible run a compression test on the motor if your interested it would be money well spent. Prop damage speaks for itself. Do not let a dented prop run for long it will create further damage to the drive.  You've heard of the phrase "knowledge is power"? In purchasing a used performance boat this is an understatement. Check the local used boat market to see if the boat you want is in your price range. You may be forced to step up price wise or step down on your desired boat. Do not go for the cheapest boat, you will pay for that mistake in the long run. Remember you are buying a boat not a car or a house. You do not need a performance boat, you want one. Enjoy yourself, it could be educational and fun. If you find yourself considering a boat that you are not really happy with in an attempt to fit your budget, you may want to hold off and scrape up a few more dollars. Some people advise you to "stand by your price without budging, walk away if they don't give you what you want." It just doesn't work like that, the conditions and opportunities command you to be more fluid. You must be ready to maneuver to pay more than you had originally assumed because you are not an expert. You need to learn the market by seeing what X amount will get you. Don't be afraid to raise your original budget. DO NOT BUY SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE BECAUSE IT FITS YOUR BUDGET. If you can't afford it then wait till you can. Limit your shopping to a few months or you will become a career shopper achieving nothing in the long run. You may have heard "a boat is a hole in the water in which you pour your money into". This occurs when people try to steal a boat and the laugh ends up being on them. Also when boat owners attempt to cut corners on services they find themselves paying for drive replacements. If you can't afford to own, store, and maintain your boat then don't buy one maybe golf is your thing.  It is important to be considerate to those selling the boat. Price and value should be known before seeing the boat. You may not have the bottom line but don't just call people up and throw a ridiculous and insulting offer just to appear shrewd, this will expose your apparent ignorance. Know the value, know a good deal. If the boat looks great and the owner seems honest and took good care of his boat then don't be afraid to tell him so. No one likes doing business with someone that is griping about the condition of the boat to get a better deal. This will only cause a distance between the two of you pushing the seller away. If the boat is at a fair price and you like it then do not lie and say "this is all I have". Again no one likes a sleazy sales person and no one likes a sleazy buyer. Offer the seller a lower price and back it up by telling them about other boats that put his price out of the market price. If the boat is a sweet deal then buy it. More people lose great deals getting caught up in the game. If you love it but it happens to be a bit more than you wanted to pay then it may benefit you to move your price to fit your needs. Many times buyers are informed to move their needs to fit their price. In some ways it may be necessary but remember, your boat is solely about your enjoyment. If you're walking out on a great boat over a few dollars, then something went wrong in your negotiation. DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR OBJECTIVE, YOUR BUYING A BOAT NOT WINNING A NEGOTIATION WAR. Your ego may need to take a back seat for a moment.  There are a lot of great people (sellers) that will help you more than you know. if you just lose those boxing gloves and just talk. Bonding with the seller will inspire them to give you useful hints. If the seller is getting out of boating, they may be inspired to give you some or all of the boating toys and accessories that will just be taking up space in their garage. Some people may let you test drive the boat, some may not. Do not pass up a boat for this reason if you know the boat, which you should, if you did your homework. Then check out the motor and other criteria and be sure to run the motor before you buy. Do not ask to run the motor unless you plan to buy.	Become familiar with performance boats. Determine how large of a boat you need. Look at the deck layout of different boat models. Compare Vee bottom vs Deck Boat. Look at engines and drives. Look at what to do to check out your potential used performance boat?, How to know if you're paying the right price?, Be prepared for wheeling and dealing. Be respectful to the sellers you will get much more from them.

Use multiple colors for an extra vibrant piece of art., Hang it up and enjoy!	Gather your supplies. Mix the liquid and and paint.Lay the watercolor paper on the old tray. Make the bubble art. Allow your piece of art to dry.
The structure of each book club is a bit different, and there are no strict rules regarding how to designate a leader. In fact, some book clubs don’t have a leader at all. However, selecting a leader can help the conversation stay on topic and enrich the book club meeting.The book club’s host often doubles as the conversation leader. You could also choose to invite a subject matter expert to lead the meeting. For instance, if you’re reading a book about the French Revolution, you might invite a local professor of French history to lead the conversation. Alternately, your book club might decide to choose a single leader who runs every book club meeting. English teachers, librarians, or authors often make good book club leaders.  If you’re both the host and the conversation leader, having some questions about the book is crucial to keep the conversation focused and flowing. Even if you are not the conversation leader, though, having some questions ready to ask the group can make your meeting more enjoyable.If your book club is reading a well-known book, you’ll probably be able to find some study guides with questions in them online (or in book stores). For instance, if you’re reading 1984, you might run a search like "1984 study questions” through your preferred search engine. If you’re reading a book that doesn’t have questions available for it online, read the book carefully and come up with some open-ended questions that can elicit thoughtful reactions from club members.  Phones can be a serious distraction from conducting an effective book club. Before the meeting begins, ask everyone kindly to turn their phones off. Use a friendly tone when doing so., At the beginning of the book club, hand everyone a pen or pencil and an index card. Encourage them to write a question or comment on an index card. Collect the cards before you get started, then read them out loud (or hand them to the conversation leader to read aloud). Invite responses to these questions and comments.Having book club participants write their thoughts on index cards can allow club members who are less outgoing to share their thoughts, too. This is also a useful method for facilitating conversation on controversial books.  Hosting and attending a book club should be fun, but some people like to use book club time to chat with friends. Include a designated social time at the end of the meeting for such off-topic conversations. That way, people who are there to talk and think more about the book get the opportunity to do so.If a club member is talking excessively and wandering off-topic, help them refocus their attention on the book with gentle but firm directions. For instance, if someone is talking about their weekend plans instead of about what they think of the book, transition back to the conversation by saying “Let’s talk about the third chapter. Was anyone surprised by the protagonist’s decision?”	Designate a conversation leader. Look up some study questions for your book. Encourage club members to turn their phones off. Ask club members to write down questions or comments. Plan to socialize after you’ve discussed the book.
; ,,, When the dough forms a ball during mixing, take it out of the bowl. Place it on the floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes. Knead until it is smooth and not sticky to handle.  Cover it completely with aluminum (kitchen) foil. , These strips will be used to form the dough basket.  Line them across the bowl one way, then weave in the remaining pieces up and over the already added pieces.   For any leftover pieces, just tuck them underneath the lip of the bowl and press in firmly to create a smooth join.  Bake for 4 hours at 275 °F (135 °C), or until it is completely dried up and hardened.  When the bowl is baked sufficiently, take it out of the oven. Place on a wire rack to cool.  Painting the basket is optional––if preferred, just leave it the color of the baked dough. Or, paint it any preferred color, perhaps to match your kitchen décor. Finish with a layer or two of varnish. This protects the basket from wear and tear and stops the dough from breaking down. Use food-safe paint and varnish if the basket is to be used to store food, to ensure that any food you put into the bowl is good to eat.   For extra decoration, you might like use clay to sculpt something, such as a cherry. For a cherry, shape it from the clay or spare dough and bake or air dry as needed. Stick a little wire in the top, then paint the cherry red.  The bread dough basket is now ready for use. It can now be used to hold fruit, vegetables, bread, bits and pieces, cellphones, whatever you like.	Place the flour, salt, and water into a mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients together using the mixing spoon.  , Sprinkle flour over your work surface so the mixture doesn't stick when kneading.  , Knead the dough. Prepare the oven proof bowl that will form the mold for the basket. Roll the dough out on another flour-covered platform.  , Cut the flattened dough into 1 inch (2.5cm) wide strips. Weave the strips on top of the bowl. Bake the basket. Remove the baked basket. Paint and varnish the basket. Done.
This design uses a base color and an accent color. The first color listed is your main house color, and the second color is your accent house color.   Gryffindor: Red and Gold Hufflepuff: Black and Yellow Ravenclaw: Blue and Bronze (books) or Blue and Silver (films) Slytherin: Green and Silver  , This design will create alternating thick and thin stripes. Your first stripe will be a thick one, using your main house color. The main house colors are listed below as such:   Gryffindor: Red Hufflepuff: yellow Ravenclaw: Blue Slytherin: Green  , You can use a stockinette stitch or a garter stitch. The stockinette stitch is alternating rows of knits and purls. It is knit on one side, and bumpy on the other. The garter stitch is knitting on each row. It will give you a bumpy texture on both sides.  Once you reach the end of the row, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Set the yarn aside, and pick up your accent color. The accent colors are as listed below:  Gryffindor: Gold Hufflepuff: Black Ravenclaw: Bronze (books) or Silver (films) Slytherin: Silver(films)  , Use the same stitch as you did for your main house color: stockinette or garter. Be sure to leave behind a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail when you start knitting., Once you reach the end of the second row, cut your accent color down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Pick up your accent color., Once again, leave a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail at the start of the first row and the end of the second one. This will create a distinctive double-stripe seen on the house scarves in the later films.  Most scarves are about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Repeat the pattern listed below:   20 rows in your main color 2 rows in your accent color 2 rows in your main color 2 rows in your accent color  , Knit two stitches onto your right needle. Use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Slip that first stitch of off your right needle. Keep knitting a stitch, then using your knitting needle to pull the previous stitch off the needle. Stop when you have one stitch left., Once you reach the of the row and have one stitch left, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Thread it through the last stitch, then back through the loop. Make a tight knot, then use a yarn needle or a tapestry needle to weave the tail back into the scarf. Trim off any excess yarn., Go back over your scarf where you had the color changes. Tie the tail ends together, then weave them back into the body of the scarf. You can do this with a yarn needle or a tapestry needle. Trim off any excess yarn., Wrap some yarn around your palm three times. Cut the excess yarn off, then snip the bottom of the loop. Use a crochet hook to pull the folded part of all three strands through the bottom corner of your scarf. Pull the tail end of the strands through the loop. Tug on the tail ends to tighten them. This makes one tassel.You can match the tassels to the stripe you are weaving them into. You can also use the other color. Consider alternating the tassels between your two house colors. Space the tassels about 2 stitches apart.	Choose your house colors. Cast on 20 to 25 stitches with the main house color. Knit 20 rows. Change colors to the accent house color. Knit two rows. Change back to the main house color and knit for two rows. Knit two more rows with your accent color. Continue knitting until you have the scarf as long as you want it. Cast and bind off. Tie the yarn off. Tie the tail ends and weave them in. Consider adding add tassels or a fringe.
If this is a maintenance service, you may want to locate a new belt before removing the old one. If the belt has broken or slipped, you can wait until the old one is removed before buying a new one so you can compare them to be sure the new one is the correct one for your vehicle.   Most vehicles require rubber timing belts, as opposed to older steel timing chains. Available for a few dollars at any auto parts store, you'll likely need to change yours every 90,000 to 120,000 miles (140,000 to 190,000 km), depending on your engine.; , You will need to know the make, model, and year model of the vehicle, as well as the engine type and size. Some models may have variations even during one model year, so your VIN may also be helpful. You can purchase a new belt at a dealer or an auto parts store.  Your parts supplier should be able to tell you what you will need. Timing belt kits are also available that include replacement gaskets and other necessary materials to complete the job., Ensure you have your radio security code (if equipped) any preset radio stations on a piece of paper to allow for quick resetting once repairs are made.  Depending on your model, you may need to remove the serpentine belt to get to the timing belt. Loosen the nuts, pushing the alternator if necessary to create slack on the belt and remove it., Do not remove pressurized fittings from the air conditioning compressor, most can be unbolted and pushed out of the way without discharging the system. Remove valve cover assembly as required for access to timing belt.  You may need to pry apart the retaining clips to free the distributor cap, as well as remove any screws holding the cap in place.Some modern cars with electronic ignitions don't have distributors. They will have a cam and crankshaft position sensor instead. The important thing is to be able to determine Top Dead Center (TDC) on the first cylinder. Consult the engine repair manual, since these will differ by model.  Using a wrench or socket on the crankshaft bolt rotate the engine until the timing mark on the crankshaft pulley is aligned with the 0° mark on the timing scale.   Verify the distributor rotor is aligned with the index mark on the distributor housing indicating the rotor is in position to fire the number one cylinder. If not, rotate the engine another full turn. Don't do this on interference engines unless you're sure the belt is still intact. If you have not already bent your valves with a broken timing belt, you will likely do so if you spin the crankshaft without the camshaft spinning.  Often, the cover saddles over the end of the crankshaft, and this pulley will not allow you to remove the cover without first removing it. Note that an additional seal will be needed to reinstall it if this is the case and special crankshaft pulley and gear removal alignment tools may be needed.  Remove this cover off the engine. Some engines have a two-piece timing cover. Remove any components or accessory drive belts that interfere with removing the timing belt cover. This varies by model; consult your service manual to determine which parts need to be removed from your vehicle.  Many engines have a dot or index line on the pulleys and/or sprockets that must be lined up with corresponding marks on the block, cylinder head, or accessory shaft. On some engines, the index mark on the camshaft sprocket aligns with the parting line of the first camshaft-bearing tower.   This is very important if you're replacing a timing belt that has broken. Consult your service manual for the correct alignment procedure for your vehicle and correct any misalignment before installing the new timing belt. These marks may also be displayed on a label on the timing belt cover on some engines.  Look around the camshaft and crankshaft seals, as well as the valve cover and oil pan. Check for coolant leaks from the water pump and water pump by-pass hose. Leaks should be repaired before the new belt is installed.  Do not remove the tensioner completely unless replacing it. Instead, pivot the spring-loaded tensioner away from the belt and then retighten the mounting bolt(s) to hold the tensioner in the loose position.  Spin the tensioner pulley and listen for a rattle or humming noise that would indicate loose or worn bearings. Uneven wear at the rear of the old timing belt could indicate a misalignment between the tension pulley and timing belt due to worn bearings.   If any indications of damage or worn bearings are found, replace the tensioner pulley. The permanently lubricated tensioner pulley bearing can become dry, worn, loose, broken or can freeze up, so the best practice is to replace it, if it's not new.  With the tension on the timing belt relieved, the belt should slide easily off the sprockets. Timing belts that have been used for a long time may stick in the pulley grooves and require some gentle prying with a screwdriver to release. Inspect the timing belt pulleys and water pump for any need to replace before proceeding to install the new belt.  Torque the timing belt to the proper specifications, paying special attention to "torquing" specs on the engine manual, particularly the crankshaft pulley mounting bolt which usually has a very high torque spec.   If equipped with a hydraulic timing belt tensioner, removal may be required to compress the piston back into the cylinder after a ratchet is released. Place into a vise and compress until holes line up to allow the insertion of a holding pin. Once the pin is in place, the tensioner can be re-installed when the belt is installed with the pin pulled to allow the tensioner to place tension onto the timing belt.	Buy a new belt before proceeding with removing the old one. Gather the information about your vehicle. Make sure you also purchase gaskets and gasket adhesives required for reassembly. Disconnect the negative battery cable. Remove the alternator belt. Remove any accessories such as the power steering pump, alternator, and air conditioning compressor so you can access the timing belt cover. Remove the distributor cap if your vehicle is equipped with one. Line up the timing marks. Determine if the harmonic balancer pulley needs to be removed to remove the timing belt cover. Remove the bolts or screws holding the timing cover in place. Check for proper alignment of the crank and camshaft timing marks. Check the area around the belt for signs of oil leakage. Loosen the mounting bolt(s) holding the belt tensioner using any special cam holding tools, while following the service manual. Examine the tensioner pulley for damage such as dents or cracks. Slide the belt off the sprockets. Replace with a new belt and reassemble.
Planning a dance can seem like a really great idea when you first get it, but be prepared to commit fully and get organized. Sometimes it's more helpful and fun to plan with a friend.; , Remember, this is your chance to be original. You could do whatever you want, it could just be a casual-dress if you like, but you may have to consider what others would like the theme to be as well. They are the people who you're trying to please!  , A venue is another thing you must plan for well in advance. It isn't recommended to have a dance in someone's house, as you don't have as much freedom as you might want. Make sure you check out the venue before the dance, you don't want any nasty surprises on the night!  , Just anyone who you know will make a good impact on the dance, you don't want any party-poopers or people you don't really know well. It's up to you if you want it to be a girl-boy dance, where everyone comes with a partner. If not it will be just as fun with all of your girl/guy friends there!  , This will give your guests plenty of time to rearrange any other plans in the way. Invitations don't have to be anything special, it could just be an email if you wanted it to be! Just remember to mention the where, when and dress code.  Just mention in the invitation that they should eat beforehand. You should still provide lots of drinks and snacks though.  If people are coming with partners, you may want to create a slow-dance-tune for near the end of the dance.  Give yourself an hour or so for you to get ready then make sure you are back at the venue at least 45 minutes before the guests arrive.	Be committed. Chose a theme for the dance. Have a place to hold your party. Decide who to invite. Send out invitations three to four weeks prior to the event. If you have a tight budget, then don't provide a lot of food for your guests. Music is an easy one, just create a playlist with all the 'in' music on it. When the day of the dance comes, you may want to decorate and prepare for it on that day. Remember one thing whilst the dance is going on, have fun!
Have your vocal instructor play a range of notes on the piano in ascending and descending order. Try and mimic the notes until you reach a note that's beyond your range. This will allow you to identify your range. Alternatively, you can download an application that can help determine your range.When you are first learning to sing bass, your range is typically low. For instance, you may only be able to sing a middle range octave with a few notes on either side.  A bass vocalist should be able to comfortably sing the notes C4 to E4. Work with your vocal teacher to expand your range so that you can sing these notes. Focus particularly on creating an even tone for each note.Try singing scales at the lower end of your range that you are comfortable with and then gradually go lower. Practice these scales daily., Bass singers typically sing with a chest voice instead of a head voice. This means that the sound resonates lower in the mouth and chest. The sound is often deeper and less breathy than your head voice. In order to practice chest voice singing, try talking first and then transition into singing.For example, try repeating the words uh-oh while singing a variety of different notes. You can also place your hand on your chest while singing in order to feel the vibrations. This will help you determine when you are singing from the chest.  Some bass singers will develop a vocal wobble. This is a result of singing wide open and not rounding the vowels. In order to prevent vocal wobbles, you should practice creating rounded vowels. Keep your mouth round while singing a variety of different vowels.For example, sing the word "more" while completing a scale of notes. You can also try singing "me" while keeping a rounded mouth., When you are learning to sing bass, it is important that you listen to other bass singers. This will help you develop an ear for bass vocals and can help to inspire your own voice. For example, try listening to Barry White or Isaac Hayes.	Identify your vocal range. Work to expand your range. Sing from the chest. Practice rounding your vowels. Listen to other bass singers.
Your thumbs tend to cramp and become sore if you play the drums a lot.Try to rest your thumbs between performances and practice. Do not engage in activities, like texting and typing, that require you to use your thumbs. Try gently massaging the skin around your thumbs or soaking them in warm water.  There's no magic trick to getting better at a musical instrument. You simply need to practice each day. The only way to become proficient in playing the snare drum is to put in the necessary work.   Practice should be part of your daily routine. Just as you brush your teeth and shower in the morning, practicing your snare drum should be a daily priority. Take half an hour to a hour each day to practice. Schedule practice time into your weekly routine. If you get done with school or work around 3 o'clock each day, see if you can schedule practice time around 4 o'clock. You can adjust this schedule on weekends or if there are extenuating circumstances. Make sure you're conscientious of others when practicing. Drums can be loud. If you're playing on a second story, make sure you put down carpeting or a rug under your drums to muffle the sound. Try not to practice too late at night or too early in the day.  Keep a record of yourself practicing. You can listen to yourself playing afterwards and check for your strengths and weaknesses. You do not need extensive equipment to record yourself as your primary goal is to gauge your own proficiency. You can use your laptop or phone to record practice sessions., Lessons can be a great way to increase your proficiency. There are many different techniques and styles involved in playing the snare drum. After learning some basics, consider seeing a professional instructor. He or she will be able to observe you playing and offer specific feedback based on your style.   If money is an issue, consider buying a book on the snare drum. While this is not the same as one-on-one instruction, it could provide some additional insight on technique and style.	Rest your thumbs. Practice each day. Record yourself. Consider lessons.
You really want to be a famous star, don't you? You daydream about being on stage and hearing the roar of the crowd. Only trouble is, gee whiz, you're dreaming your life away.   If you want to write a really good song, you're going to have to work for it. Start today. Commit to writing a certain number of songs per week, the way successful authors commit to writing a thousand words a day.  You may have your favorite and you may think the other kind of music sucks, but there's a reason people like it. Find out what that is.   Good writers read several genres of books. Good songwriters listen to genres of songs. As you listen, think about what you like about a song. Are the lyrics unique, do the song's chord changes perfectly capture a mood, do you like the transition from one part of the song to another?  , You don't have to have a degree in music theory to write a good song, but you should have an understanding of how songs are built. This includes a basic understanding of harmony, melody, and rhythm.   Harmony is about the chord arrangements and having harmonic qualities that blend with both the rhythmic feel and the melody of the song. A beginner would want to look into basic major and minor keys and chords which pertain to the given key they are working in.  In the key of C, the chords going up the neck are:   C, Dm (minor), Em, F, G, Am, and Bdim (diminished). They are also called by their scale steps, which has the advantage of not being "key-centric." For example, the C is the I (one), the Dm is the II, the F is called the IV, and the G the V. The I IV and V chords of any key can be thought of as a meat and potatoes way of writing a song, as these three chords will accompany any melody that stays within the given key. Most pop songs are built around a I-IV-V structure. There are infinite ways to structure a song, but there's a common sequence found in most of them (see Tips). As you listen to songs, try to identify the different parts. Check yourself by looking at lyrics online or in a music book; the parts of songs are often labeled in these media.  Unfortunately, inspiration usually doesn't strike at the most convenient times, so it's important that you be able to remember each new song that pops into your head, no matter where you are.   Carry a pen and paper with you wherever you go, or better yet, carry a tape recorder or digital audio recorder—melodies can be extremely difficult to capture on paper unless you have a strong music background.  Think about something that really touched you or changed your life. That special someone? A bully? A bad breakup? Think about it and describe it. How did that feel? Did it hurt? Does (s)he make you think about him or her all the time? Just start by thinking about personal experiences!   It would be helpful if you have a musical instrument (e.g. piano, keyboard, guitar, etc.) so that you can explore the music. An added advantage is that you can easily write down the notes (or tabs) when you have a tune. Try recording it for feedback. Guitars plug directly into computer microphone jacks with an adapter. You can always go back to your recording. It helps. If you revise it, then record it again.  Once in a while, inspiration will hit you like a full force gale, and suddenly you have a full song out of nowhere. Most of the time, however, just a small piece of a potential song will come to you, leaving you to do the hard, but fun work of fleshing it out. You should have a feel for what part of the song you've come up with.   If it's super catchy (either a lyrical phrase or a snippet of music), and you can envision it being a repeated theme in the song, you've got the chorus or refrain — the climax or summary of your musical story — and you need to write verses to explain how you know in detail. If what you've come up with, seems more narrative lyrically or subtler musically—a part of a story rather than the main idea—you've probably got a verse, and you'll need to write the rest of the story (more verses) and, usually, a chorus.  Make sure your music fits the story. If it is sad, then you may want your melody to evoke sadness (by slowing it down or adding some minor chords, for example) or you might want to add a twist and combine sad lyrics to upbeat music in order to create a sense of tension and ambiguity.  A song can get by with poor lyrics, and you have a better chance of writing a really good song if your lyrics are great. This does not mean they have to be serious, but they should not be clichéd or ho-hum. Write your lyrics as though you are talking to somebody who you want to impress or to someone toward whom you feel some sort of deep emotion.  Lyrics can appeal to emotions, and they should also appeal to the ear. There are a few different ways to do this. Words should fit with a rhythm you are creating in the song, and the way these words sound play an important part as well. Some words sound smoother than others (for example, "cool breeze" sounds smoother than "frigid wind.") Use the texture and character of words to add to the feeling of a song.   Another useful tool for the song writer is a rhyming dictionary. There are a variety of ways you can rhyme lines in a song to help tie the lyrics together. Learn about these and other tools of poetry, and try putting them to work for you. You can rhyme at the end of every line or every other line, or your rhymes can come more sporadically. You can also rhyme within lines to good effect (think of rap lyrics). There are also other poetic devices you can use, such as alliteration ("They paved paradise, put up a parking lot"). The "p" sound is repeated. And, assonance ("...honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you faking"). The repeated "ah" sound in "honesty", "promise" and "gonna"). However, do not burden yourself with rhyme! You can get away with making a phrase stand out by avoiding conventional means of fitting it into a song, and many successful songs do not rhyme at all.  Repetition is what makes a song catchy; repeated choruses, for example, stick in our heads even when the rest of a song does not. It is easy to ask people to join you in a refrain, which is why it is usually called a chorus. That’s why so many people know just a few lines of so many songs.   While there are good songs that are so simple that they have no chorus and have the same line length, the same rhyme schemes, and the same chord progressions repeated throughout them, most people get bored with that. The most common way to add variety is to insert a bridge into your song. A bridge is a section of music, sometimes instrumental, that differs in its construction from the verses and the chorus, and is usually placed near the end of the song before the final chorus, where a verse would typically be. The bridge can be in a different key—using a different set of chords—than the rest of the song, but it doesn't need to be. It can also be faster or slower, shorter or longer, or otherwise different from the other sections. Sometimes a bridge is followed by a shorter chorus, depending on the length of the bridge. Be aware that bridges can also refer to the transitions between verse and chorus, as this is a common usage of bridges.  The hook is that elusive part of a great song that captures your very soul and makes you want to listen to that song over and over. Hooks are frequently found in the chorus and often become the title of the song. Sadly, there is no recipe for hooks, but you'll know when you have one. Better yet, your friends will tell you, because it is the part of a song they can not seem to get out of their head. Here are a few examples:   "Here's my number, call me maybe." If you've heard Carly Rae Jepsen's hit even once, that will be burned into your synapses forever. "Oppa Gangnam Style". PSY's surprise YouTube hit has a hook that, like "Call Me Maybe," has spawned millions of views and almost as many parodies—the sign of a truly infectious hook. In Tommy Tutone's song "Jenny/8675309", the hook lyrics may be the numbers 8-6-7-5-3-0-9. In the Beatles' song "Hey Jude" the hook may be the ending part, Naaa, naa naa, nana naa naaaaaa, nana naa naaaaaaa, hey Jude that repeats and repeats as it bores its way into your brain. Good hooks let people remember your tune from your lyrics, even if they do not coincide. Many people can remember the riff from 'Smoke on the Water' from hearing the title.  If the pieces do not fit together, try building a transition. Put all the sections of your song in the same key. If your song suddenly changes in tempo (speed) between the two parts, try gradually changing the speed as you enter and exit the section that does not fit with the rest of the song. Try adding a short instrumental interlude that will carry you from one part to the next. While it is possible that two parts should not be in the same song, it could be that you started one part with the wrong meter or wrong kind of beat.  Play or sing your song for people and get their opinions. You’ll probably get a better idea of what they really think after you’ve written a few songs: friends and family may tell you that your first song is great even if it’s awful, but as they hear more of your songs, they’ll probably give you hints like, "It’s good, but I liked that first one you wrote better" or "Wow, that’s the best song you’ve written. That’s a really good song." Be prepared for a critic in the family that will accept nothing less than to hear it post-produced with all the bells and whistles that a band in a studio can offer.  Keep writing and practicing, and you'll find yourself getting better and better. You may need to write a lot of songs before you hit on one you really like, and even after that, you may need to write a lot more before you get another good one. Work hard and have fun doing it!	Stop thinking about writing songs, and start writing songs. Listen actively to different types of music. Get technical. Learn the chords. Be ready when inspiration comes calling. Learn to write lyrics. Figure out what you've got. Set the mood. Say something. Make your words sing. Strike a balance between repetition and variety. Look for the hook. Smooth the rough edges. Get feedback. Once you've finished your first song, don't stop.
Use a shovel to dig next to the stump, exposing the roots underneath the surrounding dirt. Move around the circumference of the stump and continue digging until you've exposed all of the largest roots around the tree. Dig deep on either side of the roots to expose them as much as possible.   If the roots seem very large and deep, and it's difficult to completely uncover them, you might want to consider a different root removal method. The digging method works best when you're able to uncover the roots almost to their tips.; , Depending on the size of the roots, use loppers or a root saw to cut them into pieces. Cut them into manageable pieces and pull what you can out of the ground. Toss them into a pile as you go, clearing away as much of the root system as possible.          Using an ax to cut the roots is possible, but not recommended because it can shatter dangerously if it strikes a rock, and it will usually end up stuck between roots if they are not completely exposed.  Use a grub hoe to wrench the remaining embedded roots out of the ground to their very tips. If you need to make more cuts as you go, do so — it will make pulling them out of the ground easier. Keep going until you've removed all of the major roots, then go back and pull out anything that's left.  After all or most of the roots have been processed, you should be able to easily dislodge the stump. You may need to use the shovel to dig underneath the stump and cut a few more roots under it before you can get it out.          Now that all the wood has been removed, you can chop it up and add it to your compost pile.  The final step is to fill up the hole with loam or sawdust. If you fail to do so, the ground around the hole will collapse and you'll have a large dent at that spot in your yard. As the loam or sawdust settles, the ground will sink in a bit, so you may need to keep adding material to the area every few months before the ground will stay flat.	Dig around the roots. Cut up the roots. Pull out the roots. Remove the stump. Fill in the hole.
Trading cards often have dual purposes and for Pokémon cards, you can either collect the cards for the fun of hunting them down or you can collect them so you can play the Pokémon Trading Card Game.If you only want to collect and display cards, you have the freedom to go in any direction with the kinds of cards you want. You can collect based off of Pokémon types, card values, sets, or any category you can think of. , Some people exclusively try to collect rare or special cards while others are looking for certain types of Pokémon or want to catch them all. Being more specific with your list can help narrow down your search among the 700+ Pokémon that currently exist. As you start out, keep in mind that there are different rarities for cards. 'Rarity' is a term used to determine how hard a card is to find and the rarity is marked on the bottom right of the card with a symbol:Easier to find cards include common (black circle mark), uncommon (black diamond), or rare (black star). Harder to find cards are either holofoil rare (black star with holographic art), ultra rare (white star), or secret rare(rarity symbol with a serial number). Some of the most sought-after cards are either full art (cards with only art), EX ('EX' is next to the Pokémon name), or reverse holos (holographic sheen is on everything but the art). These cards are limited edition and can be worth a lot of money in mint condition., It's easier to start collecting the most recent printing of cards because they are more widely and readily available. Pokémon cards are released in sets when they are printed by the manufacturers but the sets are spread out across the world in separate packs of cards, such as starter or booster packs. Many people aim for collecting a whole set; there are generally 102 different cards per set. Be aware, sets can also have expansion packs that extend the list of cards you will need to complete that particular set. It is easier to collect a set while it's in print. The older a set is or if it goes out of print, the more difficult it will be to find those cards and they will often become more expensive as well., Vendors online as well as places like flea markets and hobby stores will often have options to buy cards in bulk. You can purchase a large amount at a discounted price and usually save money on shipping as well. One downside to bulk purchases is that you may not find anything of high value. But sometimes there's a rare card hiding among a few hundred common ones. The hunt for valuable cards is part of the advantage and allure for buying in bulk.	Decide what kind of cards you want to collect and for what purpose. Have a target list of what you want to collect. Research what kind of cards are currently in print. Buy in bulk.
In addition to an empty bottle with a dispenser pump, you will need liquid scent-free soap and perfumed essential oils. Essential oils will determine the color and the scent of your foaming hand soap and are believed to have various health properties.Make sure to use a scent-free soap. Otherwise, the soap will overpower the subtle smell of the essential oils. Essential oils can be found in most supermarkets and health shops. There is a large range of colors and scent, such as orange, rosemary, violet, and many more. Aromatherapy claims that essential oils have many health benefits. While some are true, many others are largely exaggerated., Cover the surface on which you will work with a plastic tablecloth and be sure to have a tap in the room. Wear an apron to avoid staining your clothes and use gloves if you have sensitive hands. Keep a kitchen roll handy in case water spills on the table or on the floor.   Be particularly careful with essential oils. They stain easily and are very hard to remove.  Pour the tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Add a teaspoon of essential oil and mix until the ingredients form a homogeneous liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.If the scent is not strong enough, add another teaspoon of essential oils. Don't add too much at once as essential oils are both powerful and expensive. You can also modify the color by adding food coloring. Always use natural coloring to avoid chemicals.	Buy the right ingredients. Prepare the room in which you will make your soap. Mix the ingredients.
Going out of business sales are often good opportunities to find inexpensive furniture.   Check online or call furniture stores in nearby communities to ask about scheduled sales.; , Damaged furniture will likely be discounted.  You can buy many types of furniture, including solid wood dining sets, bedroom furniture, coffee tables and end tables, desks, bookcases and television and stereo cabinets.  Some stores and websites specialize in selling unfinished furniture.  You may say you saw similar furniture priced lower at another store, and you would be willing to pay the other store's price.  Shopping online has disadvantages because you can't test and handle the furniture, but prices may be much lower. Be sure to include shipping costs when deciding whether to buy online. Get the best prices by comparing online websites(Wayfair, FabFurnish, Ikea, urbanladder, etc)	Watch Sunday newspaper ads, television ads and online websites for sales at local furniture stores. Shop at retail furniture stores for new items that are scratched or dented. Purchase from all-wood furniture specialty stores to avoid furniture made from cheap pressed wood or particle board, which may be sold at high prices even at premier department stores. Buy unfinished furniture from stores or online and stain or paint it yourself to save money. Negotiate prices with sales staff, as some retail stores will lower prices for customers who negotiate. Shop online for discounted furniture.
You'll need the tool kit that came with the bike, and probably the manual to follow along with. You need your new spark plug CR8E (NGK) or U24ESR-N (DENSO). It costs about US$8.; , By the manual you should have a gap that is 0.70-0.80mm (0.028-0.031 in).   You check this with something called a feeler gauge that looks like this picture. This tool is just a pocketknife full of different thicknesses of metal. The 'gap measurement' is the number stamped on the feeler blade that will fit between the plug's electrodes without being forced.    For guaranteed safety, you could disconnect the battery first. First locate the plug. You don't have to remove any parts of the faring (plastic body) to get at it. The plug has a connector wire on it that might be kind of hard to remove by hand. Treat things gently, you can use the small pliers in your toolkit to slowly and deliberately lift the wire straight off the plug.  Clean around the plug and where it fits with the engine. Digging around here with a toothbrush is fine, maybe you have a real garage with compressed air? The point is to keep crud from falling to the inside of your engine -that would be bad.  You have a spark plug tool, really just a crude socket. You will turn this with the '17' half of your wrench. If you've misplaced the original tools, the plug could be removed by a long socket, or some clever wrench that is 5/8.  It's pretty close quarters in here.  Again, this is a bit like open heart surgery. Nothing goes in here but the new plug.  Old vs New. In this case we probably could have got away with scraping the old plug clean. But the plug is 2 years old already.  FIRST screw the new plug in by hand until its firmly seated. Don't force anything, cross threading on the engine block itself would be horrible. Honda is pretty particular about tightening with the spark plug tool: New NGK Plug directions: A) Tighten a 1/2 turn after plug seats. B) Loosen the plug. C) Now tighten plug again: 1/8 of a turn after it seats.  This went back on a lot easier than it came off.  It's pretty satisfying to do simple things with a bike yourself. This is simple enough that it can become an annual maintenance thing. A motorcycle should be a great way to learn more about mechanics. You don't need to have ramps, jacks, or a lift. Assuming you also have a car, if you fumble bike maintenance then you still have a ride in to work the next morning. Keep your mind and wrenches turning.	Gather your tools. Look at your new plug. Prop up your bike and get to work. Keeping clean. Tools. Remove old plug. Now you have a motorcycle with a hole in it. Quick comparison. Place the new plug in. Replace the spark plug wire. Done.

Compare the measurements of your curtains and curtain rods to the window itself. Most curtain rods can adjust size to fit a variety of windows. Measure the length of the curtains to determine how high you want to hang them. Hang the curtains with your hands to the window to see the best location. It will help to have a pal test the location of the curtains for you.   Some prefer curtains to cover the window's entirety, while others prefer the curtains to cover the top half of the window.; , Measure 2 inches (5.08 cm) to 4 inches (10.16 cm) above your window or window molding, depending on how high you want to install your curtains. Use a straightedge to draw a horizontal pencil line at this height. Draw the line slightly higher if you want your window to appear a little taller than it actually is.Use a step ladder to help make an accurate measurement. To help make an accurate line, use a yard stick. If you're still having trouble, use a friend to help you mark the measurements accurately.  Extend the line about 2 inches (5.08 cm) to 4 inches (10.16 cm) past the window or window molding edges, depending on how far past the window you want your curtains to extend. If you want your curtains to make your window look a wider, draw the line a little further out than 4 inches (10.16 cm). Make sure your line extensions are equal on each side of the window.   The extended lines will mark, roughly, where the ends of the curtain rods will be. Check the evenness of your line with a level. If the line isn't perfectly even, erase it and redraw. It’s best to plan for a higher hang opposed to low hanging curtains., If you are planning to mount several curtains, you should follow this same process on each window. Your room will benefit from even curtains around the room. Copy the measurements from the initial window to all the other windows.	Determine how high to hang your curtains. Take measurements on the wall. Map out where the curtain rod will hang. Make further measurements.
Items needed are safety goggles, rubber gloves, a stainless steel pot, a glass bowl, a glass measuring bowl, a scale, rubber stirring utensils, thermometer (two thermometers if possible, one for the oils and one for the lye), the soap batch recipe, the recipe ingredients, and soap molds.; , Important note: the caustic nature of the lye will etch the glass bowl making it appear frosted. The glass bowl will be fine but the look is permanent.  The lye and water will react with each other and initially get very hot. Be sure to always add the lye to the water. Adding the water to the lye may cause a bubbling "volcanic" reaction. ,, It is recommended to wear the goggles and rubber gloves here in case of any lye splashes.  Expect to stir continuously for about 15 minutes, until the mixture starts to thicken, like pudding. This is called the "trace" stage. Using an electric stick blender is one way to speed up the stirring and bring the soap mixture to the "trace" stage more quickly.  Again, the "trace" stage can be recognized by the patterns left in the soap mixture as it is stirred. It will resemble a thickening pudding.  Be sure that the soap mixture is evenly distributed.  Wrapping the molds in a blanket or towel for insulation will keep the soap warm and accelerate the curing process.  Remove the soap from the mold, cut in to bars and allow the bars to cure and dry out for 4-6 weeks.	Gather all the necessary materials. Fill the glass measuring bowl with the appropriate amount of distilled water, based on the recipe. Add the appropriate amount of lye very slowly to create the lye/water solution and stir. Set the lye/water solution safely off to the side so that it may cool a bit.  , Weigh the oils and melt them in the stainless steel pot using the stove on medium heat.  , When the lye/water solution and oils have reached the same temperature, ideally around 110 °F (43 °C), stir the lye/water solution slowly in to the stainless steel pot of melted oils to create the soap mixture. Stir the soap mixture thoroughly. Once the soap mixture reaches "trace", add the essential oils, other fragrances or herbs, pigments and stir. Pour the soap mixture into the molds. Stash the molds in a warm place and allow them to cure and harden for 24-48 hours. After the soap has hardened, its water content will still be quite high.
They should be parallel, but not straight, as shown here.     ; , Make it the mirror image of the first; they should intersect in some points.  They should be relatively thin and horizontal.  Add four or two if you want to make it a double barbed wire.  Make sure you leave a space between lines, similar to the thickness of the base wires you drew.  Use grey to mimic metal, or black to make it look like a tattoo.	Draw two curved lines forming the first wire. Add a second set of lines. Draw an oval covering each of the intersections. Add spikes to the ovals you just drew. Add vertical lines to the ovals. Color your drawing.
You will find that hair and soap residue may have accumulated underneath the strainer or stopper, which is located in or over the drain. Remove any screws securing the strainer, and remove the stopper by twisting and lifting it.Scrub any gunk or hair that has accumulated.  Fill the kettle to the top with water, since there’s no exact measurement of how much water you should use. Allow the water to come to a boil. You can use a large pot to boil water if you do not have a tea kettle.  This may instantly unclog the drain. Remember to avoid splashing the hot water, as it could burn you. Now, turn on the bathtub to see if it is now draining normally. , Allow the baking soda and vinegar to sit for 15-20 minutes. You can use a timer to keep track of the time.  Once again, fill the kettle up with water and bring it to a boil.  The water will react with the baking soda and vinegar to unclog the drain. Test the bathtub to see if this method unclogged your drain, and try another method if this one did not work. Using baking soda and vinegar does not use any chemicals and generally works for small clogs, so this may not work every time.	Clean the strainer or stopper. Boil water in a tea kettle. Pour the boiling water directly into the drain. Pour ¼ cup of baking soda and 1 cup white vinegar into the drain.If pouring hot water into the drain did not unclog it, use baking soda and vinegar to remove excessive gunk.  , Wait 15-20 minutes. Boil more water in the kettle. Pour hot water directly down the drain.
Manufacturers may choose to have their toilet models tested by Maximum Performance (MaP) a group that advocates for better toilet flush performance in North America. The group maintains a public database of about 2,500 toilets that have undergone voluntary testing my MaP. Access the site to see the flush performance of toilet models you may be considering.   MaP has set removal of 350 grams of waste per flush as the minimum acceptable level and the U.S. EPA's WaterSense Program sets the same minimum for their tank-type toilet specification.Since participation in this testing program is voluntary, you won't find information for all toilets in the database.  A high-efficiency toilet (HET) is one that uses 1.28 gallons (4.8 liters) of water per flush. Since a toilet accounts for one-third of your home water use, these can be a great way to save money on your water bill. On the downside, staining and clogging can be an issue with some models, so do your research.   Check with your water utility company to see if they offer a rebate or some form of financial incentive if you install a high-efficiency toilet. High-efficiency toilets earn the U.S. EPA's WaterSense label, a designation that means among other things that they perform as well or better than their less efficient counterparts and are 20 percent more water efficient than average products in that category., These toilets use a separate tank to hold water under pressure. When you flush, this water is released at high velocity and removes waste more thoroughly. These toilets are more expensive and noisier than traditional models and could present a challenge should they need parts or need to be repaired.  Standard toilet bowl height is 15", but you can purchase a toilet with a bowl height between 17" to 19" These toilets, made to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, are easier on the back and the knees and more comfortable for older and/or taller adults. Their added height comes with a bit of a higher price ($50-$100) and small children or shorter adults may find them more difficult to use.  Dual-flush toilets, available in both gravity and pressure-assist models, use 25 percent less water. They cost a couple of hundred dollars more than other models, but you'll save money in the long run. They're available only in a limited number of colors and style options.	Check for flush performance. Decide if you want a high-efficiency model. Investigate pressure-assist toilets. Consider your need for comfort. Declare a dual.
Soak in a bucket or sink of plain water for 15 minutes.  If you use jam jars just push half the fabric into the jar and leave the rest hanging out., It helps to drip a different colour down each side of the jar. Then push more fabric in and drip more dye into the jar., Add more dye if there are still white areas. Leave for at least 15 minutes and preferably longer., You don’t want the fabric swimming in solution, just damped by it. Leave for 45 minutes. It will not harm if it is left for longer – in fact the longer it is left the more time the dye has to bond to the fabric., Fill the container with water, pull out the fabric and rinse very well. At this stage the dyes will still contaminate other fabrics so if you have a lovely yellow piece do not rinse with a dark blue piece or sections will go green. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Then rinse again in hot water, again until the water runs clear. Finally, put through a hot wash or rinse in the washing machine. Hang out to dry and iron when slightly damp.	Cut your fabric into pieces – fat quarter size works well. Arrange fabrics in a container – you can make formal pleats or just scrunch it in. Drip or spoon dye onto areas of the fabric. Using rubber gloves, press the fabric down firmly until no white is showing. Pour washing soda solution over the fabric, making sure all areas of fabric are in contact with the solution. Take the container to the sink and pour excess dye away.
You'll need a basecoat of white emulsion plus an overcoat in any color you'd prefer. Only the overcoat will be seen when finished.   Emulsion paint comes in three different finishes: vinyl matte, vinyl soft sheen, and vinyl silk. Matte emulsion hides imperfections well, but soft sheen emulsion is more durable. Silk emulsion is the most durable and handles high-moisture areas better than the other two, but its glossiness tends to draw attention to imperfections on the surface of the wall. The white basecoat should usually be matte emulsion, but the overcoat can be any of the three varieties.; , Typically, it's best to "cut in" the paint around the corners of the wall using a paint brush. The rest of the wall should usually be painted with a roller, however.   A 2-inch (5-cm) paintbrush should work adequately well for cutting in the sides of the wall. Lambswool, foam, and mohair rollers can all be used with emulsion paint. As a general rule, you should use a roller with a greater amount of nap (more thickness) for rougher or more uneven surfaces.  Before painting, you should remove as many decorations and as much furniture as possible. Cover the floor with a plastic drop cloth to shield it from any stray emulsion.If there's a radiator on your wall, consider turning it off and removing it while applying the emulsion paint. Allow the radiator to cool and drain before removing it. Turn off or block all electrical outlets. Cover the edges of light switch plates and outlet plates with painter's tape. Apply painter's tape over the skirting boards, floor, ceiling, door frame, and window frames immediately adjacent to the wall.  Scrub the wall down with warm water and mild detergent to remove any oils from the surface. Rinse with clean water and let the surface dry.   You can scrub, rinse, and dry the wall using clean rags. It's very important to let the wall dry before continuing. Since emulsion is a water-based paint, applying it to water-covered surfaces could prevent it from adhering correctly.  If the current wall surface is glossy or smooth, rubbing it down with 40-grit sandpaper could help the emulsion adhere more effectively.   Wrap the sandpaper around a cork block and gradually work over the entire surface of the wall. When finished, use a lily bristle brush to sweep away any dust from the wall.  Emulsion that sits in storage will usually develop lumps and skin. It might be a good idea to strain these solid portions and mix the paint before use.   Check the manufacturer's recommendations since the best mixing practices can vary by brand and make. Place tights or cheesecloth over the paint bucket, then pour the paint into a separate bucket through that material. Doing so will generally strain most solid pieces from the paint. You should also use a wooden paint stirrer to quickly combine the paint before use.  Using a basecoat will help cover any color or pattern currently on your wall, thereby preventing that original color from showing through your final overcoat of paint.   To prepare a basecoat, combine one part white emulsion with three parts water in a clean, empty bucket. Use a paint stick to thoroughly blend the mixture. Apply the basecoat using the same technique you'll use for the overcoat emulsion. “Cut in” the seams of the wall using a paintbrush, then apply it to the remaining wall surface using a paint roller. Allow the basecoat to thoroughly dry before proceeding with the overcoat.  You should “cut in” the emulsion around the seams of the wall using a paintbrush. After the seams are covered, switch to your paint roller and apply the emulsion to the rest of the wall.   Cutting in should be done around all seams of the wall and in any area the roller won't reach. This includes any area where the wall meets other walls, ceiling, or floor. Additionally, all seams around electrical outlets, light switch plates, doors, and windows should also be cut in. Any area that can be easily accessed with a roller should generally be painted with a roller. Other tools, including large paint brushes and paint pads, can be used instead of a roller, but for the sake of ease and consistency, paint rollers are generally best.  You may need to use more than one coat of emulsion, but you should allow each coat to finish drying before applying another one over it.   This also means that you should allow the white basecoat to dry before applying a top coat in your final color. The necessary number of coats will vary depending on the color you choose and the original color of the wall. Dark colors are difficult to paint over and may require as many as three coats, especially if your new paint is lighter. For more specific guidelines, check the emulsion manufacturer's recommendations, which can usually be found on the label.  If any emulsion drops onto the floor or onto another hard surface you don't wish to paint, immediately wipe it away with a damp rag.   Since emulsion paint is water-based, it's usually easier to clean than oil-based paints. Get to the spill before it dries, however. If the spill does dry, you may need to apply an appropriate paint thinner to the area before wiping it clean.  Fill a 2.5 qt (2.5 L) paint kettle or bucket halfway with emulsion. Work with the paint in this kettle during the entire cutting in procedure.   Use a 2-inch (5-cm) wide paintbrush for best results. When dipping the brush into the emulsion, only submerge approximately one-third of the bristle length.  Hold the brush at a 90-degree angle away from the adjacent surface, then apply the emulsion using straight strokes that run parallel to that same adjacent surface.Apply the first straight stroke within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the seam. After completely the first stroke, turn the brush so that the long edge is perpendicular to the seam. Work back over the original stroke, carefully pushing the paint into the seam in the process. When finished, roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of wall space should be covered by the emulsion. Corners that meet in three dimensions, like the space between two wall corners and a ceiling, may require a slightly wider cutting in area.  After you finish cutting in the edges, you should immediately begin to emulsion the rest of the wall. Do not wait for the cutting in emulsion to dry.   If the emulsion does dry completely, the areas you cut in may remain visibly separate from the rest of the painted surface.  Pour the emulsion into a paint tray until the tray is roughly one-third full.   Use a tray specifically designed for use with paint rollers. There should be a sunken well at one end and a ribbed, slanted platform extending up toward the other. Pour the paint directly into the sunken well.  Quickly dunk the soft sleeve of the paint roller in water. Gently squeeze out any excess water before continuing.   To remove the excess water, pass the roller over clean paper towels or other non-inked absorbent paper material. The water will not dilute the color of the emulsion. Since emulsion is a water-based paint, however, water can help the roller apply the paint in smoother, more even strokes.  Dip the paint into the filled well of the roller tray. Spread the paint over the sleeve by passing it up and down the ribbed platform, then lift the roller out of the tray.   You only need to apply a light coat of paint to the roller. If emulsion drips off when you lift it up, there's too much on it. Roll the roller over the platform again to scrape away some of the excess.  Mentally divide the remaining wall into 1-yard (1-meter) squares. Paint the wall one square at a time until the entire surface is covered.Tackle the square in the top corner first. If one corner is closer to a window than the other, choose that one since the sunlight can make it easier for you to check the application and coverage of the emulsion.  Place the loaded roller in the center of the square, then roll over the all in diagonal M-shaped strokes.   Start at the bottom of one side and work toward the opposite side. After the first "M," you'll need to lift the roller and create another "M" over the first. This second "M" should be perpendicular to the first. Repeat these diagonal strokes, reloading the paint as needed and changing the angle periodically, until the entire square has been covered.  After covering the entire square with diagonal M-shaped strokes, roll over the area in parallel vertical strokes.   Overlap the strokes slightly so that the emulsion blends together evenly. Try to overlap the paint onto the "cut in" areas around the seams of the wall.	Purchase the emulsion. Gather the right applicator tools. Clear the area. Clean the wall. Consider sanding the wall. Strain and stir the paint. Apply a basecoat. Paint the seams before painting the broader surface. Allow the emulsion to dry completely in between coats. Immediately clean any spills. Pour the paint. Paint in straight lines. Do not wait for the paint to dry. Pour the paint. Dampen the roller sleeve. Load the roller. Visually divide the remaining wall space. Work in M-shaped strokes. Cover your original strokes with vertical strokes.
To achieve the greatest resistance, it is essential that concrete is well punned or vibrated to eliminate trapped air.; , It is to 'plasticise' the mix, reducing the amount of gauging water required, giving the mix additional strength and flexibility to prevent it cracking or crazing during a more controlled drying out period. It provides a compact easily worked mix when wet with a smoother hard wearing, less dusty surface when dry.   The improved adhesion of the mix helps considerably when used for mortar rendering purposes. The liquid can be used with all types of Portland Cement, but not with high alumina cements. It is simply mixed with water 1:30 and added to the cement/aggregate mix as the gauging water to the required consistency.	Pun or vibrate the concrete. Understand the effect of the additive.

Start by boiling 3 cups (710 ml) of water in a kettle or in a pot over the stove. Bring the water to boiling temperature (212 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius)., Do this slowly and carefully, making sure not to spill any of the water on you. Pour all of the water down the drain to flush it out.  Once you have poured the hot water down the drain, let it work through the drain for five minutes. Then, pour 3 cups (710 ml) of cold water down the drain to help congeal and remove any remaining debris or grease in the drain.  Do a final flush of the drain with 3 cups (710 ml) of boiling hot water. This should remove any remaining grime or debris in the drain.You can flush the drain with hot water on a weekly basis to keep it clean.	Boil the water. Pour the hot water down the drain. Pour cold water down the drain. Flush the drain with hot water again.
This shirt will form the base of your costume. It does not need to be fancy. If anything, simpler is better. It should neither be taut nor baggy. Comfortably snug is best.; ,   Use a bright blue spray paint approved for use with fabrics. Do not use baby blues or near-black dark blues. You may want to do one layer, let dry, and assess the color. If it's not rich enough, spray on another coat.  If you have a limited budget (of money or time), it might be easier for you to create the top blue portion of the costume with a blue t-shirt. The shirt should be loose enough to wear over the white shirt but not so loose that it can be seen flapping or blowing around in the breeze. Cut the bottom of the shirt off, starting at the mid-chest area, and hem it up with a needle and thread or by tacking it together with fabric glue or fabric tape. (Captain America's abs are red and white -- that's why you'll only need half a t-shirt.)    , Measure the distance between the cut bottom of your blue shirt or the bottom of your football chest pad to the bottom of your white shirt. Cut out several strips of red felt or red duct tape -- each strip should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide.   Depending on the illustration, Captain America has somewhere between 3 and 5 red stripes vertically placed on his waistline. Use the size of your stomach to determine how many stripes you need and how wide they should be.  The bottom of each stripe should start at the bottom hem of your white shirt and should extend up to the bottom of the blue shirt or blue painted chest pad. Space the stripes about 2 inches (5 cm) apart (depending on your size).   If you're using tape, no further adhesive is required. If you're using felt, use fabric craft glue or sew the strips on with needle and thread.  The white star can be made of any felt or fabric and should be about 6 inches (15 cm) tall and wide.   The star could also be made out of thin white cardboard or silver metallic poster-board. Alternatively, you might be able to find an iron-on star patch if you do not want to create one. Adhere the star to the front of the blue top. It should be centered on your sternum, not overlapping onto the white t-shirt portion. Glue, sew, or iron-on the star to the blue shirt or blue chest pad.  The blues need to match or be very close to matching; if not, the costume will look disjointed. You could use blue football pants, but if you cannot find these, use sweatpants (tight sweatpants) or leggings.   If you can't find a pair that match, look into dyes. They're widely available at fabric or craft supply stores and aren't very expensive.  And if you can pull off spandex, by all means.  A plain brown or black leather belt will work, or you could find a combat-style belt with various pouches hanging off of it. Either way, a belt is necessary to complete the outfit and to cover up the elastic band of your pants.   Captain America only sometimes wears the pouches on his belt. That being said, it will cover up where the two pieces of your outfit meet -- typically the hardest area to make look professional.  While the old Captain America from the comic books had a face mask, the newer version of the costume uses an actual helmet. A simple army-style helmet will work best, but if you want to get picky, look for one that is specifically in the style of a 1940s M-1 fixed bale helmet. Spray paint the helmet the same shade of blue as your chest pad or t-shirt.   If it's near Halloween, you're in luck. If it's not, find an army supply store or a vintage reproduction shop. But the easiest option is definitely online.  Captain America's outfit includes a face mask as well as a helmet. Select a short mask that only covers the eyes and spray paint it the same shade of blue as the helmet. This could be as simple as a sleep mask or a sash of fabric. Nothing fancy is needed.   Alternatively, use a blue ski mask or blue swim cap. For a simplified, cheaper version of the mask, a blue ski mask that stops above the nose will also work and does not require the addition of a separate eye mask. You could also use a blue swim cap paired with swimming goggles.  You could cut an "A" out of felt or make one out of silver or white duct tape. You might also be able to find a pre-made "A" as an iron-on patch or sticker. Adhere the "A" using glue or a needle and thread to the front center of your helmet, ski mask, or swim cap.   The "A" should be rather geometric-looking; no soft curves and curly-cues. It should resemble an 8 on a digital clock, but with a wider base.  The gloves can be standard rubber kitchen gloves, or you can get use leather gloves for an "updated" or well-polished look. Either way, they should extend somewhere between your mid-forearm and elbow.  If you went with leather gloves, leather combat boots are in order. If you went with rubber gloves, red rain boots or red sneakers paired with tall red socks might work better.   Whatever the overall look of your Captain America, keep it coordinated. If he's more like Captain America's poorer, shabbier-looking twin, make it work. As long as every piece is on the same level, your costume will look as one.  For ease, consider a round saucer sled, large stockpot lid, or round metal garbage can lid. If none of these are available, you could also cut out a large circle from a thick piece of cardboard., Start by spray painting the shield white. The white paint acts as a primer and can also be used for the white stripe on the shield.   Paint the center blue. At the center of the shield, there should be a medium blue circle. The circle should take up about 1/3 of the total diameter of the shield. Add two red stripes. Each one should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. The first stripe should encircle the center blue circle. The second stripe should border the edge of the shield. A large white stripe should be in between them both, but you may need to widen the red stripes if the white stripe is twice the size as either red stripe or larger. The red stripes can be created with paint or with colored duct tape (but tape is harder to make circular).  The star should cover the entire area of the center blue circle but should not extend past the blue circle and into the red. It can be created with paint, decals, or white duct tape. Use whatever medium you've been using or match the star that's on your sternum.	Find a long-sleeve white t-shirt. Spray paint a football chest pad blue.A football chest pad is about the right length for the top part of the costume and it mimics the armor look of the newest Captain America costume. Cut out red stripes for the bottom of the shirt. Attach the red stripes to the bottom of the white shirt. Find or create a white star. Find blue pants in the same shade of blue as the t-shirt or chest pad. Strap a belt around your waist. Use an actual helmet. Add an eye mask. Attach an "A" to the helmet. Tug red gloves over your hands. Wear tall boots. Select one of numerous shield materials. Paint the shield. Place a white star in the center of the shield.
The most simple way to decorate a mirror and take it from basic to amazing is to stencil a design onto the glass. Buy a stencil from your local art store, cover the areas that won't be stenciled with newspaper and tape everything into place, and then use spray paint that's designed for glass to paint your design. You can also use non-traditional stencils, like paper doilies, or reverse stencils, like a leaf.; , You can make an adorable Alice in Wonderland themed mirror with some really basic supplies. Get a doll's tea set and use hot glue to attach a teacup to the edge of the mirror. Next, get a cheap pocket watch and attach Velcro at the back and where you'd like it to be on the mirror (the opposite corner from the teacup works well). Use Modge Podge or another decoupage glue to cover the remainder of the mirror in teabag tags in an artful design that appeals to you. You can tape playing cards to a string and display it like a garland along the bottom of the mirror as well.  Use wine corks cut in half to create a frame around the mirror. Then, hot glue fake grape bunches and leaves to the corners or edge of the mirror in a way that you think looks nice. If you can find charms that look like wine bottles, those can also be a nice addition.  You can also use natural materials if that would work better for your style. Hot glue together twigs in a woven pattern, or use other material like stones or fake leaves. You can also combine all three to create your own mini forest. Rocks on the bottom, twigs on the sides, and leaves at the top will look like your mirror sprouted up in the middle of a tree!  , You can buy mosaic tiles from your local art store or make your own using broken pottery pieces. Use glue or mortar to attach the pieces to your mirror. Just make sure to let it fully set before hanging it and to hang it on something that is strong enough to support the weight if you used mortar.  You can create a mirror fit for a princess. Start by covering the frame in fancy paper using Modge Podge. Then, using hot glue, attach strings of pearls, pink beads, and paper flowers to the paper-covered frame in an artful way.  This classic mirror design is easy to get for yourself at home. Buy some rope from your local hardware store and use hot glue to create a frame for the mirror by wrapping the rope around and creating a design. Then you can add other features, like gluing on a dried starfish as a centerpiece at the bottom or top.  If you want to bring more color into your home, a button frame mirror is a great way to go. Buy a large batch of random buttons off of ebay or from an antique store and use hot glue to attach them to the edge of the mirror in a design that appeals to you. Try to layer and stagger them to create a feathered effect.  You can make a mirror that looks great for the holidays with just a few easy items that are found at your local craft store during the holidays. String a few light ornaments on a piece of twine or ribbon and attach the ribbon at the two top corners of the mirror so that the ornaments hang. Surround the edges of the mirror with real or fake Christmas tree branches taped to the wall. You can finish off the look by tying a beautiful red Christmas bow and taping it to the bottom center of the mirror.  You can make a perfect mirror for your man's man cave or even just your own room by getting your mirror custom fit to the inside measurement of a tennis racket. Glue it into place and then hang the racket on a wall. Another method would be to spray paint bottle caps with your team's colors and glue them around the outside of the mirror.  Another easy, timeless theme is a travel theme. This can be customized to match a trip that is significant to you, or be generalized. Use Modge Podge to attach pieces of a map to cover the frame of the mirror. Once it's dry, tack or tape up postcards and artfully distribute stamps around the frame. You can even draw fake passport stamps on the frame for added flair!	Stencil basic designs onto your mirror. Try a cozy "Alice in Wonderland" theme. Create a classy Tuscan look. Go for a natural, foresty look. Make a mosaic frame. Go for an elegant, feminine look. Try a by-the-sea theme. Try a colorful, fun button design. Make a Christmas mirror. Got for a sports theme.

The motor and gearing for different models might be the same and the cost difference is due to the amount of stitches the expensive machine can do.; , Besides straight stitching, the zig-zag, double-stitch, button hole, reverse feature, and a handful of other stitches are all that is necessary. From a list of sewing projects you plan to do, sometime maybe, ask which sewing machines could do those projects. Check the stitch quality. When taking a test "drive" of the sewing machine determine the quality of the stitching by sewing the straight stitch. A good sewing machine will produce fine, even straight stitches. A poorer quality machine will have uneven or not-so-fine straight stitches.  An economy sewing machine will have one gear and that gear will be equivalent to a third or fourth gear in a four-speed standard transmission vehicle. The sewing machine will be be erratic at the start and when it reaches a medium-high speed it will run smoothly. A standard car can be operated from the 3rd gear and will be erratic initially and after reaching a moderate speed will run smoothly.  The machine is compact, made of a lot of plastic and light. The hand wheel will be of great assistance when starting and at lower speeds, but the light machine will be unstable when turning the hand knob (wheel).  The hand wheel is now so small that it should be more aptly called a hand knob. Hand fatigue will be immediate when assisting the motor when doing fine work and also when sewing through many layers. A belt carrier project, for example, is an extremely demanding job in that as many as eight layers of materials have to be sewed. This is the type of job that without a large diameter hand wheel is very difficult to do and have a nice appearance. A low gear, like the 1st gear in a vehicle, would be desirable for attaching carriers to the waistband.  The obvious things like bright lighting, concentration, the use of reading glasses and having a helper (to shift the rest of material while the machine operator sews) all help. Fine control of the sewing machine's pedal is best done without footwear, with your ankle in a comfortable angle so fatigue will not compromise the fine control necessary.   The hand knob on the sewing machine has to be used when sewing through thick fabrics or layers. A sewing machine with a big and easy to use hand wheel (like the older sewing machines) is the vital key, for sewing with a machine with high gearing, for highly visible work besides heavy-duty work.  Jury rig the present knob to make it turn easier or somehow replace the hand knob with a hand wheel. When choosing a sewing machine, beyond the machine having certain quality, having a usable hand wheel is the most important thing to have.  A commercial sewing machine is costly, so for occasional use in doing sewing that normally require a commercial machine, your economy machine can do it.	Ask the salesperson or the in-house repair person about the motor and the gearing. Decide what stitches are needed. Step on the foot pedal and note the smoothness of operation. Feel the weight and note the size of a modern sewing machine. Compare the size of the hand wheel of a modern sewing machine to an image of a hand wheel of a sewing machine a century ago. Develop a steady and precise control of the foot pedal. Choose a sewing machine with the largest knob available. Determine whether a commercial sewing machine is worth the investment.
The 'budget' but classy way to do this is, to make one simple poster with white writing and a black background and get someone who works in an office to photocopy it as much as possible. Otherwise, you will have an extra cost for printing. Put the following on the poster   Headlining Band Band on before them Opening band Location Date Cost Any and all websites relating to bands, venue, tickets, you etc.  Put them up in music stores, local youth hangouts, Internet cafes, schools/colleges (if allowed) and modern clothes shops.  and tell them that the gig is on. Give them all the information you have on the poster, or even post them a copy of the poster. Write a Press Release, and send it to newspapers in your area, and the area of the gig, a few weeks before the gig. Try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an 'Out& About' section or similar.  Try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious.	Make posters. Put the posters up everywhere, but always ask permission before putting them up. Ring your local newspaper/radio-station/etc. Get all the bands to put the gig on their Myspace/Bebo/Blogger, or whatever.
Generally smaller supplies like paper clips, thumbtacks, rubber bands, staples and binder clips are ideal for this project.  You’ll need one jar per supply group (i.e. one for paper clips, one for thumbtacks, etc.). Additionally, pick up a magnetic knife or tool holder strip (typically found in the kitchen section of the bath and home store) and charge your electric screwdriver (to help you mount the strip underneath your cabinet). You should also obtain a clamp (or an assistant) to hold the magnetic strip in place during the mounting process.   Consider how many jars you will need, the jar sizes and the amount of space you have when purchasing the magnetic strip. If you have several supplies you may need to find a few spots underneath shelves and pick up more than one magnetic strip. Purchase a few fender washers if your plastic jars do not have a metal lid. You’ll have to glue one washer to the top of each lid so the jar holds onto the magnetic strip.	Identify which supplies could be housed inside small plastic jars. Pick up materials needed to create your space saver.
There is a world of difference between books about starting your own business and books about climbing your way up the corporate ladder in an existing business. Likewise, someone interested in reading about improving sales may not be as interested in reading about how to manage subordinates. Decide what books your club will focus on before you start and let potential members know before they decide to join.  Ask your members for book suggestions. As the leader, you can have the final say about whether or not each suggestion will be taken. Alternatively, you can put each request up for a vote or allow each member to take a turn selecting a book without taking any vote.  The Internet is a valuable resource. Use it to find out about the business books that have grabbed the attention of professionals everywhere. If so many people are interested in a book, the information it contains may be worth adding to your own information bank.  Instead of choosing the next book to read immediately before having to read it, determine a roster of books several months in advance. That way, members have plenty of time to research what the book is about and to grab a copy of it.  As the leader of the group, it is your job to get the ball rolling. Mention a few key points you found interesting or a handful of ideas you feel skeptical about. Ask questions that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no,” and offer opinions that are open enough to be debated.  A business book club is not a lecture, after all. Make sure that anyone who has a question or idea has the opportunity to voice it. If your members are exceptionally quiet from meeting to meeting, you may consider twisting their arm a little by requesting that everyone bring at least one discussion question to each meeting.	Decide what type of business books your club will focus on. Take requests. Peruse bestseller lists and business blogs. Pick out books in advance. Share your thoughts and ask questions. Encourage others to ask questions.
All types of ferns require a different climate, however most prefer a hot humid atmosphere. Grow the fern indoors until you begin to see multiple leaves spring out from the center. The goal is to grow it until you have enough roots to hold it a ball in your hand, however you do not want to pull the plant out of the ground prematurely. If you're not sure whether the fern is quite ready to be planted outdoors, leave it in the ground for a while longer.; , During the Spring season (where winter is cold and wet where you live) is best. In warmer climates Fall is preferable.  If your fern is a good size and is actively growing, cut the leaves by half of their length. This will make it easier to move and relieve the stress of the plant.  Don't be afraid to pull up a lot of dirt along with the roots. The shape of the ball isn't too important, so don't worry about shaping it afterwards. This will hurt the roots more than anything.  Leaving a generous amount of space for the hole to fit is okay, as you will be filling it in and watering it in the extra space.  Water more than you normally would as this will get the soil ready and begin to get the fern used to it's new area. , The growing rate should be fairly close to the same. If the plant isn't responding well move it back to where you had it before. Don't move the plant's location too often as this injures the plant.	Get the fern started indoors, especially if you live in an area with unreliable weather for your particular breed of fern. Figure out the time of year best for planting. Get the fern ready to be moved. Dig out a generous ball of the roots. Dig a hole the same size as the root ball and place the fern inside. Pour water into the area. Fill in excess space with soil Don't pack too tightly, leave the soil soft.  , Monitor the plant and make sure it is growing at the same rate as before you planted it.
More specifically, you should look for a Marabou fan, which is a type of folding fan trimmed in feathers. Wrap tape around the bottom of the fan to hold it open as you work.Look for a Marabou fan with bright blue or green feathers if you want a brighter, more colorful peacock costume. This would be especially fitting if you intend to make the costume for a child, but this can be used for an adult costume, as well. If you plan on making this as an adult costume, you could look for a Marabou fan with black feathers for something a little sultrier. For added authenticity, you can even look for a Marabou fan that is trimmed with peacock feathers.; , Use a hot glue gun to glue the tips of 12 peacock eye feathers to the tip of the fan.   A child-size tail will need a total of about 50 "eye" feathers and 50 "sword" feathers. An adult tail may need several dozen more. The feathers should be between 30 and 35 inches (76 and 89 cm) long, but you may need to trim off up to 12 inches (30 cm) for a child's costume. Alternate which side of the feathers faces up so that both sides look nice when finished.  Use a hot glue gun to glue the tips of 11 peacock sword feathers to the tip of the fan. Place the swords in between the eye feathers.   The sword feathers should be slightly shorter than the peacock eye feathers, but only by 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm). Turn the sword feathers so that they are angled in toward the center. "Sword" feathers refer to peacock feathers that have the traditional coloring of a peacock tail but not the trademark "eye" pattern at the upper end.  Continue adding peacock eye and sword feathers until there are very few, if any, gaps remaining in the tail.   Apply hot glue to the stems of the remaining layers. The stems should not only be fixed to the tip of the fan, but also to the feathers of the fan and the stems of lower layers. Glue the peacock feathers on in layers. Many of the stems will overlap.  Use hot glue to attach a piece of thick cardboard over both sides of the plastic portion of the fan. Close the bottom up by attaching the two pieces of cardboard together with duct tape.   Place the fan over the cardboard and trace around the plastic portion of the fan. Cut out two identical pieces using scissors and trim away as much as necessary to only cover the plastic portion of the fan. Do not cover any of the feathers.  Cut out two pieces of felt or sparkly fabric. The pieces should match the shape and size of the cardboard cutouts.   Use hot glue to secure the fabric in place. If possible, use ravel-proof fabric so that the ends will not fray with use.  Buy a craft mask that only covers the eyes, making sure that it fits the face of the intended wearer.   A gold mask creates a brighter, more playful appearance, and can be used for a child's or adult's costume.A black mask is better suited for adult costumes as it creates a more "mature" look.  Remove the mask's elastic string and slide two pieces of narrow ribbon into the holes, instead.   Measure the distance from the outer corner of one eye to the outer corner of the other, taking the tape measure around the back of your head. Divide this measurement in half, then add 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) to this number. Cut two strands of ribbon that equal this measurement. Tie a piece of the ribbon into each hole. When putting the mask on, tie the two ribbons together in a loose bow.  Use hot glue to attach small beads or craft gems around the eyes of the mask, positioning them either along the sides or near the corners of the eye holes.   Use clear, white, or silver gems for a black mask. Apply blue and green gems if you are using a gold mask.  Outline the gems in silver glitter glue and connect the outlines with swirling glitter glue lines.   This step is only optional. If you like the way the mask looks without the glue, you can skip it.  Glue four short black feathers to one corner of the mask and glue two or three short peacock feathers on top.   Attach the feathers with hot glue. Arrange the feathers so that they come up and out at a slight angle. Glue a larger gem or hair clip over the tip of the feathers.    Hold the tape measure parallel to the floor all the way around. Place the tape measure around the area at which you expect to tutu to be worn.  Measure a band of 2-in (5-cm) elastic to match the distance around your stomach.   Instead of black elastic, you could also use blue, green, silver, or gold. Choose elastic that is nice enough to wear without being covered by additional fabric.  Use 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of 6-in (15-cm) tulle. Half the tulle should be green and the other half should be blue.   If desired, you can also add in some black tulle. Cut the tulle into strips that are twice as long as the distance between your intended waistband and knees.  Knot the tulle in a double layer over the elastic band. Cover the band completely.   Alternate between green and blue tulle strips, weaving the occasional black strip in if desired. Fold each tulle strip in half and place it beneath the elastic band. Hold the fold just above the band and stuff the ends and the rest of the tulle into the loop made by the fold, crossing over the elastic band and pulling the entire length of tulle through the loop. This should secure the tulle strip onto the band.  Use a needle and thread to hand stitch the ends of the elastic band together, forming a continuous circle.   Use your fingers to gently "fluff" and position the tulle so that the tutu looks full.  The overall length of the feathers should be between about 4 and 5 inches (13 cm).   Apply a dot of hot glue to the back of each feather and press the feathers against a plain metal hair clip or barrette. The feathers should be slightly fanned away from each other. They should also be pointed up and out at a mild angle.  Cut three circles of varying sizes out of scrap synthetic fabric.   Choose a blue, green, or black fabric so that it matches the feathers. Make sure that you do not choose a flammable fabric. The material you use should be relatively flame-resistant. The largest circle should be about 1.5 inches (4 cm). The middle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) and the smallest should be a little more than 0.5 inch (1.25 cm). The sizes and shapes of the circles do not need to be perfect, though.  Use a lighter to slightly melt and curl the edges of each circle.   This is why it is vital that you use a non-flammable fabric. Hold the edges of the circle near the flame, but do not allow the fabric to touch the flame directly. The edges should curl even without being directly immersed in the fire.  Stack the circles and sew them together in the center using clear thread.   The largest circle should be on the bottom and the smallest should be on top. Stack the circle slightly off-center from one another in order to create a flower shape.  Hand stitch a few small, translucent beads in the center of the flower to create a center.   Use the same clear thread.  Apply a generous dot of hot glue on the back of the flower and place it onto the remaining visible portion of the hair clip.   The flower should cover the stems of the feathers.  A royal blue dress is perfect for a child's costume or an adult's costume, while a “little black dress” can be appropriate for an adult's costume.   A knee-length dress will work on most body types and ages. You should choose a simple dress without any embellishments, but otherwise, any cut, length, neckline, and sleeve length will work. It is mostly a matter of personal preference.  Royal blue tights work well for both children and adults. Both kids and adults could also wear white or black tights.   For a more mature look, an adult could wear sheer flesh-tone nylons instead.  Step into the tulle skirt and pull it up so that it rests comfortably on your stomach.  Tuck the end of the tail into the band of the skirt. Keep the skirt and tail in place by tying a metallic green or gold ribbon around the elastic band of the skirt, wrapping it around several times and knotting the ribbon in place at your side or back.   Tie the ribbon snugly so that it holds the tail in place and keeps it secure. The feathers of the tail should face upward, fanning out behind the wearer's back.  A simple pair of blue, green, silver, gold, or black ballet flats should work well for this outfit.   If you want something a little sultrier or more mature, you could wear a gold or black heeled sandal.  Style your hair as desired. Tie the mask over your eyes and place the hair clip in your hair.	Find a folding hand fan. Adhere peacock eye feathers to the fan. Add peacock sword feathers. Fill in empty gaps. Hold the tail together with cardboard. Cover the cardboard with fabric. Use a black or gold eye mask. Replace the elastic with thin ribbon. Attach craft gems to the mask. Decorate the mask with glitter glue. Add peacock feathers and a final gem to the mask. Measure around the wearer's stomach.Use a tape measure to measure the distance around the stomach, right around the belly button. Cut a band of black elastic. Cut out strips of tulle. Attach the tulle to the elastic. Stitch the elastic together. Glue two small peacock feathers to a hair clip.You only need the "eye" portion of two peacock feathers. Cut three circles of craft fabric. Melt the edges of the fabric. Sew the circles together to form a flower. Sew beads in the center of the flower. Attach the flower to the hair clip. Wear a blue or black dress. Slip on a pair of tights. Put on the tulle skirt. Tie the tail in place. Add a pair of slippers to your feet. Don the mask and hair clip.
The colour is an important part of carnival glass and affects the appearance of your collection as a whole. Start by looking through the base of the glass to identify the colour accurately. Ensure that the lighting is strong so that you get a real view of the colour. Common colours are marigold, amethyst, green, and blue. Less common colours include peach opalescent and aqua opalescent. There are also many other possible colours including lavender, smoke, ice blue, ice green, lime, black amethyst, amber, moonstone, green and yellow (Vaseline), and many variations on shades and colours.  Do you want to collect any colour or would you rather concentrate on a few colour types? Perhaps rare colours are your preference, or a colour that fits in with your home décor theme.; , There is a huge variety of shapes to choose from. When collecting, you might like to confine your collection to certain styles, or to figurines, crockery, etc. Here are some of the possible shapes:  Bowls, plates, tumblers, pitchers, and vases Beads, hat pins, brooches, buttons, purses, jewelry, and beaded dresses Lamps Swan salts, money boxes, powder bowls, soda or whisky bottles, toothpick holders, cuspidors (spittoon, snuff, tobacco), perfume atomizers, etc. Special event/commemorative items  , Patterns can form an important part of your collection too. With over 500 distinct patterns on carnival glass, there is a lot to choose from. Patterns include geometric shapes, flora, and fauna.  Flower patterns often focused on pansies, roses, iris, tulips, thistles, waratahs, and poppies  Fruit shapes included apples, pears, peaches, berries, cherries, and strawberries Animal shapes included lions, horses, fish, bears, kangaroos and other Australian native animals.  Modern glass cannot replicate the iridescence of the old carnival glass. This is due to the reality that the chemicals used are now considered health dangers. Modern day carnival glass can be discerned from the older glass by an experienced collector and still has its place in a collection if wished. The only downside to this is that there isn't very much of modern carnival glass to collect., There is a range of places where you can shop for antique carnival glass:  Look at online auction sites. They will have many choices available. Be sure to check shipping costs and liability for breakage in transit. Visit antique stores. Find out which ones specialise in carnival glass by looking online, phoning, or asking when you visit antique stores. Attend live auctions where quality vintage goods are sold. There will often be carnival glass pieces; call the auction house ahead to find out what it has on offer, or to find out when they think they'll have carnival glass to auction. Ask around family and friends. You never know what they've got stored in their attics. And once they start seeing your collection, undoubtedly they'll remember whether they have a piece or two to spare you.  Obviously glass is fragile, so you'll need to set aside a suitable place to display it that is safe and unlikely to be in the way. A cabinet with glass doors is an ideal display piece, or perhaps along shelving of a bookcase or attached to a wall. If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, attach the pieces to the shelving using art or poster tack., Meet other collectors and share stories, tips, and ideas with one another. You will also have the opportunity to make trades and to learn a lot about your collection.  Find out whether there are ways to display some of your favourite pieces from your collection so that you can share the joy of collecting with others.	Learn how to check the colour. Decide what sorts of shapes you'll collect. Choose the patterns you'd like to collect. Consider whether you'll add modern carnival glass to your collection. Look for your carnival glass pieces.  Decide where to display your carnival glass collection. Join carnival glass clubs.

Electric start engines should be tilted down so that the propeller is in the water. This will allow the fuel to readily flow into the engine during starting. Keeping the engine tilted down also keeps the propeller safely in the water while starting.On rare occasions, boats are equipped with fully electric outboard motors. These motors still have electric starters, and the starting procedure is the same as the procedure for a fuel driven motor with an electric start.  Electric engines require the key to be in the ignition before important features, such as the gearshift, will operate. Insert the key into the ignition slot, and if necessary insert the kill switch, too. This should enable you to shift the engine to neutral, An electric motor may have a manual gearshift that you can move to neutral. Alternatively, you may have to move the throttle to the neutral position. This will allow you to start the engine., You start most engines by turning the key to the “On” position. Some engines will have a start button that you must push. Once the engine starts, release the key or button.	Tilt the engine down. Insert the key. Put the motor in neutral. Turn the key.
Look for daisies with thick stems at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Look for healthy, fully open flowers for a more beautiful chain.; , Cut a small slit through the middle of the stem, without breaking it in half. You can cut this just below the flower, or halfway down the stem.   If your fingernails are too short, use a plastic knife.  Push the base of the stem through, until the flower is snug against the slit.  Make a slit in the next daisy and push the third stem through it. Repeat until you've made a bracelet, crown, or necklace. When you think your daisy chain is long enough, cut a second slit through the first stem. Push the last daisy through this slit to make a loop.  To keep your daisy chain for a long time, hang it up to dry in a windy area. It might wither or change color, but it should stay together.	Pick your daisies. Slit the stem with your thumbnail. Thread the stem of another daisy through the slit. Repeat with any number of daisies. Air dry the daisy (optional).
When you prune your buddleia matters greatly in terms of care. You should always prune your plant in early spring. Usually, March is the recommended time for pruning.However, when to prune truly depends on your region. Severe frost, present in late spring in some areas, can cause damage to a buddleia.Making a decision on when to prune your buddleia heavily depends on the weather in your area. As stated above, if you prune too soon early spring frost can harm the plant. However, waiting until later in the summer, or even the fall, can be deadly for the buddleia. If new growths do not harden before winter, they will be killed by the cold. This results in a dead plant the next spring.Keep an eye on the forecast, especially if you live in a colder area or an area with unpredictable weather patterns. If you see freezing temperatures or snow in your 10 day forecast, hold off on pruning. Wait until the weather's been consistently warm and above freezing for a few weeks before pruning.; , Buddleias bloom on new wood. Even if there is no sign of rot or damage to existing branches, cut branches back to the ground in early spring. This will stimulate blooming and growth from your buddleia during the flowering season.Buddleias grow in bunches of stems sprouting from the same patch of ground. You prune the plant by cutting these stems downward towards the ground. Stems should be at least a foot tall. Stop pruning once your stems are about a foot in length. Trimming any shorter could cause damage to the plant.When you finish pruning your buddleia, it should look somewhat like a stag's antlers. Don't be alarmed by how much you cut from the plant. Such intense pruning is what helps the buddleia grow new flowers when the rainy season passes.  Buddleias can become overcrowded if too many branches sprout. If your buddleia bush looks crowded, remove older branches completely rather than just trimming them down.It's fairly easy to differentiate old stems from young stems. Young stems tend to be green. Old stems are of a darker shade and usually have peeling, gray-brown bark.You should dig out old branches by the roots. This will prevent them from re-blooming in the coming season., While the main pruning should be done in spring, wait until the buddleia appears to be done flowering. You should prune again once all flowers have bloomed. Clip any dead or faded flowers from the plant to keep it looking healthy and strong.The buddleia flowers in multiple places. Both main stems and side shoots that grow from main stems may flower. When seeking out dead flowers, look in all these places.Watch to make sure all potential flowers have bloomed before pruning again. You should not prune flowers, even dead ones, until the buddleia is completely done blooming.	Prune your buddleia in early spring. Prune severely. Remove older branches. Prune dead flowers after the blooming season finishes.
The key here in most cases to limit losses. You can't prevent every little seed, plant, fruit or flower from being eaten or destroyed. Animals normally eat only their share of a food plant and move on. Are you really going to eat all those berries on that raspberry bush? When nature is involved expect loses and hope they are minimum., If space allows plant more than you think you'll need and have a back-up batch if possible. If the seed packet is very cheap buy multiplies to replant in case of disaster. Plant a species of plant or vegetable in two or more different spots instead of one single spot. Planting one species in mass can also be useful. This will reduce the possibility of a total loss.	Compromise!, Consider having extra plots or plants for back-up.
These can be simple, general words like beautiful, special, and unique, or more descriptive words that are specific to the person, like dark haired, smart, and bold.This list will help you brainstorm lyrics for the song. So, don’t get too focused on working all of these words into a lyric. The idea is to start to build the vocabulary and lingo you’re going to use for the song. Because you're likely writing the song to please the object of your affections or compliment her, focus on positive words and phrases that you think she would enjoy hearing in a song about her.; , This will help you determine which phrases have good implied rhythm and roll off your tongue easily.   Put the phrases that sound good out loud into a list called “Possibles”, as they have lyrical potential.  Consider if there are any other phrases or words in your list that rhyme or almost rhyme.   See if you can create a line or phrase that seems to answer an idea or question in your “Possibles” list.  Aim for a general topic or phrase and don’t worry about being overly creative or descriptive. The title will likely change as you compose the song, but a working title will help you focus on a main theme or idea.  The most common contemporary song structure is: verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus. Most listeners like this song form because it is catchy due to repetition, but varied enough to be engaging and interesting.A verse in a song has the same melody but different lyrics. The verse paints a picture of a scene, a situation, an emotion, and/or the subject(s) in the song. The chorus usually appears three or four times throughout the song, depending on how long the song is, and the lyric and melody remain the same each time it recurs. The chorus lyrics should sum up the heart of the song or the overall message. The title of the song may also appear in the chorus. The bridge has a different melody, lyrics, and chord progression from a verse or chorus. It provides a break from the repetition of the verse and chorus. The lyrics in a bridge often provide an insight or revealing moment. The bridge can also add on to or extend an idea or thought in the verse or chorus.  Often, the question to be answered in a song is: “What does this feel like?” or “How am I feeling?”Don’t forget to also try to integrate the title of the song in the chorus. For example, in the popular Bruno Mars song “Treasure”, he focuses on how special and “treasured” the girl is to him. In the chorus, he sings: “Treasure, that is what you are/ Honey you're my golden star/ You know you can make my wish come true/ If you let me treasure you/ If you let me treasure you.”In the chorus, Mars reinforces the main idea of the song with other adjectives that play off of a treasure, such as “golden star”, while also keeping the lines short and to the point, as well as including the title of the song.  If you’re focusing on the physical beauty of a girl, describe this in the chorus. If you’re focusing more on your experiences with a girl or your desires for a girl, be sure to sum up these feelings in the chorus.   If we use Mars’ “Treasure” as an example again, he makes several direct statements in the chorus of the song, such as “that is what you are”, “you know you can make my wish come true” and “if you let me treasure you.” In these phrases, he directly addresses the object of affections and tells her exactly how he feels.  Structure your verses around the ideas in your chorus lyrics. Try to answer the question you picked or idea you’re focusing on in an open, honest way, and avoid formal or complicated language.For example, in Mars’ “Treasure”, the first verse is: “Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby/ I got to tell you a little something about yourself/ You’re wonderful, flawless oh you’re sexy lady/ But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else.”In this verse, Mars starts the conversation with the girl by telling her to give him her attention because he has something to tell her. He then tells her he think she’s “wonderful” “flawless” and “sexy”, but notes she doesn’t seem to realize how valuable she is (“wanna be someone else”). So, this verse ties into the idea of treasuring her, or seeing her worth and valuing that. It’s a good introduction to the main idea of the song and lets the listener know what they’re in store for.  To create a good melody, you need good pitch, phrasing, and rhythm. When you talk, you are likely already displaying all of these elements. But in a song, these elements are exaggerated and there is more repetition. So singing the lyrics will help you find a melody that is suitable for a song.Use the melodic element of speech to give your songs added emotional impact. Changing the pitch in your voice so it goes up at the end of a question or flattens out when you’re being sarcastic will add emotion to the song.In most songs, the chorus will sound more urgent than the verses, and it will use a higher note range. So try to raise the pitch of your voice when singing the chorus. In Mars’ “Treasure”, he adds in an “Oh whoa-oh-oh” before the bridge to give the song a sense of urgency and melody.Don’t be afraid to add “ohs” or “ahs” to the chorus or bridge to add emotional impact.  Strumming along to a guitar or playing a piano or keyboard as you sing your lyrics will help you create chords and chord progression.Using an instrument to compose the song will also help you find the right pitch for the melodies in the song. If you don’t play an instrument, ask a friend who does to play along as you compose. If you’d like to learn how to play chords on a guitar or piano, there are several learning methods available online., This will ensure you are comfortable playing the song live and can pour all your feelings and emotion into your performance.  Depending on how personal the song is, it’s always best to get an outside opinion of your creative work.   Try to show the song to someone who is close to the girl you are interested in, or who knows her well and can give you specific feedback about whether or not she would appreciate it.  Maybe you want to demonstrate a very public display of affection by performing the song spontaneously in a public place or perhaps you’re more into the idea of an intimate performance in a romantic setting. Whichever way you decide to present the song, make sure you do so confidently, honestly, and full of feeling.	Create a list of words that relate to the girl you are writing the song for. Arrange these words into phrases or statements and say them or sing them out loud. Try to work the “Possibles” list into longer lines or connecting lines. Create a working title for the song. Use basic song structure. Focus on answering the most important question or stating the main idea of the song in the chorus. Make at least one direct statement that describes what the song is about in the chorus. Keep the verses simple and conversational. Sing your lyrics out loud to find a melody. Use an instrument to help you put the song together. Play the song from beginning to end several times, preferably with an instrument. Show the song to someone else for feedback. Set the scene and present the song.
Driving when you’re tired slows your response times. Your focus and concentration is also compromised. During wintry conditions, this can be extremely dangerous. Try not to drive in snow or ice when you are tired or haven’t had proper rest., Before you go somewhere, especially a long distance away, you should check the weather. You should also do this if you are going to isolated areas. This helps you know what to expect. If the weather is very bad, you should postpone your trip.When you travel in winter conditions, let someone know where you are going and what time you should arrive.  Make sure your cell phone has a full battery whenever you leave the house. You may also carry a cell phone charger in your car and keep your phone plugged up so you always have a full battery. If you break down or have any problems, you will be able to call for help., Practice makes perfect! If you're unfamiliar with driving in snowy and icy weather conditions, practice after a storm in a large, empty parking lot with a seasoned driver. Practice how to brake safely, how to get out of a skid, and how your car handles in winter weather. This can actually be a lot of fun!, Use winter weather as an excuse for a night in. Even if you can drive in winter weather, you are putting yourself at risk by going out. Other drivers pose a danger to you. Slick roads and black ice are also risks even to a experienced driver. Unless you have to go out, stay off the roads.	Refrain from driving when you’re tired. Check the weather reports. Keep your cell phone charged. Practice driving in winter weather. Stay home if possible.
Then choose an appropriate boat design for this body of water. You will never have a boat that will do everything, so don't even try. Don't build a 24' Tolman Alaskan Skiff expecting to use it on a small lake, Midwest river, or pond. On the other hand, taking your 12' rowboat 10 miles (16 km) out in the Gulf of Mexico is probably not the best idea either! , Sorry to inform you, but free boat plans are just that...free. You get what you pay for, so if you want general information, sixty year old, antiquated, difficult-to-read, boat plans then by all means download the freebies that are so prevalent on the internet, but spend the $50-$150 for good plans and you will be very glad you did. It will save you money in the long run., A plywood boat can be beautiful if built, finished, and painted correctly. Using cheap materials will result in poor performance and could be dangerous to your health, depending on which body of water you are using your boat , how far from land you are, and how well you sealed your hull! , It has no voids and will not de-laminate. It will also use much less epoxy resin as it won't have voids that are common to many cheaper residential construction-grade plywood., Some good brands are Aeromarine, System Three, West Marine, and Mas. The boat designer should include the amount of epoxy needed to build the boat design you choose in his/her plans. Also, buying 5–15 gallon (18.9–56.8 L) kits is the best way to save money. If you are building a larger boat you may be able to have your epoxy supplier drop ship your epoxy on a pallet to save you money on shipping.  Sorry to those of you who thought you wouldn't have to fiberglass your boat, but the truth is 99% of good plywood boat designs are covered in fiberglass.  YouTube has many good how-to lay fiberglass videos; however finding someone local who lays fiberglass is the best way to get some hands on training. There are dozens of good marine supply stores online that will sell you a quality fiberglass and your boat plans should have the amount (length in yards) and weight (ounces) of cloth you will use on your boat.  Of course, some of you won't care, but if you want to hear the oohs and aahs at the dock or launch giving your boat a nice finish with marine paint is the key to the longevity of your fiberglass work and the appearance of your boat. Fairing (smoothing and filling your fiberglass cloth grid...think Bondo on a car) and sanding are key to a beautiful show quality finish, but may not be necessary for a work boat in the bayou.	Decide which body of water you will be using the boat on. Buy plans from a reputable boat designer. Buy quality materials. Use marine grade plywood (fir, meranti, okoume). Use a quality Epoxy Resin. Learn how to lay fiberglass cloth. Give your boat a nice finish. Use your boat...a lot!
This can be bought at any auto accessory store or superstore like Walmart in the automotive section. Brake cleaner is designed to absorb and erode oil, dirt, rust and stray paint, so if you need a higher-powered solution to your egg stain problem, it will likely do the trick.Caution: Brake cleaner is a toxic, corrosive and potentially flammable solution. Exercise care when using brake cleaner fluid at home. If applied improperly or left on too long, it could cause considerable damage to your car's paint., Create a compact, thick pad to use to apply the brake cleaner. Spray some cleaner onto the paper towel in an area slightly larger than a half-dollar. You can apply more later if you need to.   Paper towels are optimal when working with brake fluid as they can be disposed of. Avoid using a towel that you might reuse as the brake fluid is toxic and mildly corrosive.  Make your motions smooth but firm. Wipe away as much of the stain as you can, reapplying more brake cleaner as needed.  The impact and hardening of the egg stain may have chipped the paint, or the brake cleaner might have taken some paint off. Buy a small bottle of finishing paint from your dealership in the right color and touch up the areas where the paint is faded.If you want your paint to look best, the mechanics at your car's dealership can touch up your car professionally for a small fee.	Purchase a small bottle of brake cleaner. Take a heavy-duty paper towel and fold it into a small square. Go over the stain with the brake cleaner. Repaint the area if necessary.
Most beginners start out on a 2 or a 2 1/2, but if you've been playing for a while and are moving into the higher register and/or altissimo notes, try a 3 or 3 1/2.; , If you're still playing your 20-year-old hand-me-down Bundy, it's time for an upgrade -- go for a good plastic or wooden clarinet. Wood generally has a very nice tone quality, but plastic clarinets can sound good as well, and they're cheaper. If you already have a good clarinet, be sure to keep up with its maintenance. A COA (Cleaning, Oiling, Adjusting) once or twice a year is very important.  The F, F#, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are the open throat tones for the clarinet. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very few (or no) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to travel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. Sit up straight, and, using the diaphragm, push air out playing the open G. Try to relax the throat so it's nice and open while not losing the embouchure. This takes years of practice and muscle training.  Many players who are just starting or have never had correct instruction will make the mistake of "smothering" the reed with too much bottom lip, closing the throat to limit airflow, or any number of other mistakes. To form a correct embouchure, you should flatten your lower lip against your bottom teeth (as if you are putting on lipstick), which will flatten out your chin. Place the mouthpiece on your lower lip, rest your top teeth on it, and close up the "gaps" with your lips, in a drawstring fashion. This prevents you from putting too much pressure on the reed and should make it easier to produce a rich, full sound.  While it is a small instrument, it does take some work to get the most sound and volume potential out of it. When breathing, fill up your lungs from the bottom up, and blow from your stomach, not your throat. Be sure to sit up straight and have correct posture while playing. If this is done correctly over a long period of time, you'll notice your lung capacity gradually increasing and you'll strengthen your abs. If you are having trouble feeling what this kind of breath support should feel like, try standing up with your feet together and putting your weight on your toes, to the point where you are almost leaning forward. Play something. Once you see how this should feel, you should be able to transfer the same breath support to playing while seated.  Your tone quality will only get better the more you practice, and it really helps with the highest and lowest notes.  Good tone quality doesn't happen overnight, and in the end, it all comes down to skill and dedication to the instrument  , It will definitely be worth it!	Choose a good reed. Have the best clarinet that you possibly can. Practice the open-throat tones. Make sure your embouchure is correct. Similarly, make sure you are filling the clarinet with air. Practice and play often. Keep working at it. Don't give up all your practice.
There are several things you'll need to clean a Formica countertop before painting, because you have to remove grease and sand the surface before you can paint. To clean and prepare the counter, you'll need:   Bucket Grease-cutting cleanser Sponge or scrub pad 150-grit sandpaper Vacuum Damp rag or cloth Dry rag or cloth; , In order to paint your counter properly, you need to completely clear the surface.Remove any appliances, dinnerware, food, storage containers, plants, and decorations that are on the counter and store them elsewhere.   You can store items in cupboards, pantries, on the kitchen table, or in the basement or garage. Do not store items on the floor around where you'll be working.  To protect the sink from paint and cleaning products, it’s best to remove the sink from the counter. Start by shutting off the water supply to the sink. Before you remove the sink, you'll also have to remove the faucet.Use a wrench to unscrew the nuts attaching the faucet to the water supply. Remove the pipe, unscrew the nuts holding the faucet in place, and remove the faucet. Use a screwdriver to remove the long screws attaching the sink to the counter. Disconnect the sink from the water supply and drain pipes. Loosen the sink from the counter with a screwdriver if necessary, and remove the sink. If removing the sink isn't an option, cover the basin and sides of the sink with plastic, and tape the plastic in place.  With a sponge or scrubbing pad, clean the entire surface of your counter with a grease-fighting cleanser.When you're done, wipe the counter down with a clean, damp rag to remove leftover dirt, grease, and cleanser. Then wipe the counter with a dry rag and let it air dry for 30 minutes. Good grease-fighting cleansers for this job include:   Trisodium phosphate: In a bucket, mix ½ cup (4 ounces) of TSP with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water Denatured alcohol Ammonia-based cleaners, such as oven, all-purpose, and glass and window cleaners  , One problem with painting Formica is that it’s smooth and slippery, so the best way to get paint to adhere is to make the surface rougher. You can do this easily with sandpaper. Use a piece of 150-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge.Rub the entire surface with the sandpaper or sponge. Apply even pressure with the sandpaper. Don’t forget corners, edges, and crevices.  Once you’ve gone over the entire counter with sandpaper, vacuum the area to pick up dust and dirt that was left behind by the sanding. Then, wipe the whole surface down with a damp cloth.   Dry the surface with a dry cloth, and then allow the counter to sit for at least 30 minutes to air dry completely.  To paint the countertop, you will need primer, paint, and a few tools to help you apply the paint and protect surrounding surfaces. The tools you'll need include:   Paint tray Paint roller Medium paint brush Two foam roller brushes Painter’s tape  , Painting a Formica countertop isn't like painting other surfaces. The main problem is that countertops get a lot of use and endure tons of abuse. Because of this, you need an incredibly durable paint. You can choose any color or style that you like, but look for a durable paint that’s suitable for Formica, such as:   Two-part epoxy paints that are water-basedLaminate paint kits Interior acrylic paint Interior oil-based alkyd paints  , To protect nearby surfaces from paint and splatter, tape off anything touching the surface you'll be painting. This could include walls, cabinets, and the backsplash.   Good painting tapes include green tape, blue tape, and masking tape., Before you start priming or painting, open a window and set up a fan to blow air around the room. The fumes from the primer and paint can be dangerous, so keep the room well-ventilated throughout the entire painting project., If you're not using a two-part paint with a built-in primer, it’s important to prime the surface of the counter top before painting. The best kind of primer for your counter is an oil-paint. Try to match the color of the primer with the color you’ve chosen for the countertop.Pour your primer into the paint tray. Fit a roller with a clean roller brush and roll it in the primer. Wipe off excess primer on the tray. Cover the entire surface of the counter with a thin layer of primer. Use the brush to get into cracks and to manoeuvre  around edges. Wait about three hours for the paint to dry, then repeat. Check the manufacturer’s instructions on the paint can for precise drying times.  When the primer has fully dried, you can apply the paint. Pour the paint into a clean paint tray. Fit a roller with a clean, dry roller brush. Dip the brush into the paint and saturate it completely. Roll off excess paint onto the tray.   Go over the entire surface of the counter with a thin layer of paint. Use the brush to paint around edges, in cracks, and in hard-to-reach areas. Allow the paint to dry, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This is usually about three hours. Once the first layer is dry, apply a second and third coat if necessary.  As soon as you’ve painted the final coat, remove the painter’s tape. By removing the tape when the paint is still wet, you'll prevent paint from drying onto the tape and peeling off with the tape.To remove the tape, gently pull it toward yourself at a 45-degree angle.  Once the paint has dried, after 24 to 72 hours (check the manufacturer's instructions), replace the sink. Fit the sink back into it's basin, reconnect the plumbing, screw the clamp screws back in place, and reconnect the faucet.  Depending on the type of paint you used for your countertop, curing time could take anywhere from a couple hours to several days or even longer than a week. During this time, it’s important that you don’t put anything heavy on the counter, don’t get it wet, don’t have food near or on it, and avoid disturbing it as much as possible.   If you don’t give the paint time to cure, it could smudge, get dented or marked, or not adhere properly to the surface. Check the paint can for the manufacturer’s instructions regarding curing time for the paint you used.  Whenever your cutting or chopping, always use a cutting board to protect the paint and the counter surface. This will prevent scratches, chipping paint, and other dings and marks.   To protect your knives and keep them sharper for longer, use wood cutting boards instead of plastic, bamboo, or glass., Heat mats will protect both the paint and the laminate from damage. Never put a hot pot or item directly on the counter, and always place a trivet or heat mat on the counter first. The same applies in the bathroom, and you should never put hot styling tools directly on the painted counter.   Hot items can burn or melt the paint, leave scorch marks on the laminate, warp the counter, and separate components within the Formica., Use sponges and cloths, and clean the counter with liquid cleaners and soaps when necessary. Avoid scrubbing pads and harsh powder cleansers that could strip the paint from the surface.	Gather your cleaning supplies. Clear everything off the counter. Remove the sink. Wipe down the counter with a degreasing cleanser. Sand the counter. Vacuum and clean the area. Gather your painting supplies. Choose the right paint. Tape and cover adjacent surfaces. Ventilate the room. Apply two coats of primer. Apply the paint. Remove the tape. Replace the sink when the paint is dry. Give the paint time to cure. Don’t cut directly on the counter. Use heat mats. Avoid abrasive cleaning products.
This mixture is especially useful for soft-bodied insects, such as aphids, caterpillars and parsley worms. The soap is absorbed by the pest and then causes dehydration and death.   Mix 1 to 2 tbs. (15 to 30 ml) of plant-based soap with 1 qt. (0.95 l) of water in a spray bottle. Many people use Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castille Soap, a product made with olive oil. Shake the mixture up and spray it regularly at any sign of bugs.  Insects and other pests are deterred by strong smelling plants, herbs and spices.   Find a mixture of plants like garlic, rhubarb, mint, onions, cayenne, ginger and horseradish. Cut them up into large pieces and place them in a pot or saucepan. Cover them with water and boil. Turn off the heat and allow the "tea" to sit overnight. Strain the liquid away and pour it into your natural insecticide bottle. Create a caffeine mixture, if you are having a problem with aphids. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of yarrow, lavender and/or catnip with 2 tbs. (10 g) of used coffee grounds and 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Allow the mixture to sit overnight. Strain the liquid and pour into a spray bottle.  It will lose its potency after that, and you will need to mix up a fresh batch.	Mix some natural insecticide soap. Increase the effectiveness of the soap against all pests by mixing in some strong smelling vegetable water. Keep your all-natural insecticide and strong-smelling water on hand for 1 to 2 weeks.
Check to see if the float ball is too high. If the ball is too high, water is running into the overflow pipe and out of the handle.   Bend the float ball arm down slightly so that the water comes up to about 1” below the overflow pipe. Flush the toilet to ensure that enough water gets into the bowl. If the water level is insufficient, then adjust the float ball arm up slightly until the tank fills with water.    Pinch the clip attached to the thin metal rod. Slide the clip and the cup down to lower the water level. Move 1” at a time. Flush the toilet to ensure that enough water gets into the bowl. If the water level is not sufficient, adjust the cup slightly upward.    Turn the knob counterclockwise 1/4 of a turn using a screwdriver. Adjust the knob 1/4 turn counterclockwise until the water is below the overflow pipe. Flush the toilet to ensure that enough water gets into the bowl. If the water level is insufficient, adjust the knob slightly clockwise until enough water fills the bowl.    Check to be sure that the overflow pipe is 1/2” below the handle. Use a hacksaw to shorten the pipe, if needed.	Adjust the positioning for the float ball. Lower the water level by adjusting the Water-Intake Assembly. Adjust the knob of the Metered Fill Valve. Check the Overflow Pipe.
V-brakes or center pull brakes press directly on the rim to stop the bike. Dirt or grease on the rims can interfere with the brake friction and cause squealing. Wipe off obvious dirt with a clean cloth.  Rubbing alcohol, acetone, or another oil-free solvent are ideal for removing grease. Wet a cloth in one of these substances, then scrub away grease on the rims.   Warm soapy water isn't ideal, but usually does the trick.  A wet surface has less friction, so dry it with a clean cloth or paper towel. Handle the wheel by the spokes, not the rims, to avoid transferring oil from your hands. (This is a good tip to follow in daily use as well.)  , Occasionally, a sharp object or a fragment of metal embeds itself in a rim brake pad. Inspect the pads carefully and pick out any foreign objects with an awl or other sharp tool.   If the brake pads are worn thin, you may need to replace them. Typically, there should be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of rubber between the clamp and the tire when the caliper is engaged to brake the bike. You can use a brake pad gauge to measure this precisely.  New brake pads have a hard surface that needs to be worn in. This will happen naturally over time, but you can shortcut it with a light sanding. If your rims are especially smooth and shiny, scuff them up a little as well.  You'll have less noise and better braking ability if the pads are angled inward. Looking down from above the wheel, the front of the brake pads should be slightly closer to the rim. Most rim brakes allow you to adjust the angle by tightening or loosening nuts, and/or rotating washers.Never bend the arms of the brake pads to adjust the angle. This will weaken the metal.If your bike doesn't allow for this adjustment, consider replacing the brakes.	Wipe the rim with a dry cloth. Clean off grime. Dry the rims. Check the brake pads for damage. Sand the brake pads or rims. Toe in the brake pads.
Keep an eye on both the driver and the driver’s view of the street ahead to anticipate sudden turns and stops. Avoid the back of the bus if possible, where the effects of turning and/or braking on your balance may be more pronounced.; , Allow yourself more room to adjust your footing as needed without stepping on someone else or their belongings. Avoid being knocked off balance by someone else.   If space is limited onboard, stand near people who aren’t carrying any purses, bookbags, or other bulky items that may effect their balance and/or yours.  Keep your center of gravity as low as possible.   If you prefer keeping your hands free for any reason (fear of germs, dirty surfaces, etc.), go ahead, but stake out a spot within easy reach of a handhold anyway. Keep at least one hand free (preferably the one closest to the handhold) so you can grab it quickly if you lose your balance. Also consider bringing a pair of gloves so you can maintain a firm grip for the duration of the ride.	Stay near the front of the bus. Stay clear of other people. Find a handhold.Prioritize those at hip- or chest-level over those that force you to reach overhead.
Use a garden rake to loosen the dirt and rake in the soil mixture you purchased for the herbs to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm). Sprinkle water over the soil to moisten it. Dig holes several inches apart in preparation for planting the herbs.   If you're planting the herbs in pots, determine how many will fit in each one. Many herbs get quite large as they grow, so you may not want to plant more than 2 - 3 seedlings in each container. You can add a bit of fertilizer to the soil, but again, don't over-fertilize or the herbs won't thrive.  The herbs are ready to plant when they are well-established and have sprouted several mature leaves. Plant them when outdoor temperatures are above 50 degrees, and the chance of frost is gone. Carefully lift the seedlings from the pots, loosen their roots, and plant them in the ground. Pat soil around the base of the stems, then dampen the area with water.   If you're planting the herbs outside, it's a good idea to transition them to outdoor temperatures by allowing them to "harden off" in a garage or other covered outdoor space for a few days before you plant them in the ground.  How that the herbs are established, you have only to care for them by making sure they consistently get enough sunlight and water. Pay attention to the moisture level of the soil, and never let it get dried out. Your herbs will grow healthy and strong, and soon it will be time to harvest them.	Prepare the planting bed. Plant the seedlings. Care for the herbs.
; , Then pound down flatter, to spread it into a circle shape.  Using your fingers, mold the flattened piece into a perfect circular shape.  Use a small round object to cut out a hole from the center, in much the same way as cutting a cookie. Measure the object first to ensure there is plenty of wreath left.   Cutting objects could be made from a toothpaste tube lid, a drink bottle lid, a miniature round cookie cutter, etc. Whatever you use, make sure it is clean and won't transfer drink dye or sugary stickiness onto the clay.  Shape a little bow from the clay or use a ribbon bow; whichever you find easiest or prefer. Use fresh clay to adhere the bow to the wreath.   Smooth the edges on the inner circle once you've removed the inner circle of clay. This will neaten the wreath.  This will depend on the type of clay that you have used; follow the manufacturer's instructions.  If baking, do not add the ribbon bow until after the wreath is baked; it risks burning or curling up in the oven.  Thread a ribbon or piece of yarn around what is the top of the clay wreath decoration and hang it on the tree. Alternatively, hang it on your dollhouse door.	Take a spoonful of modeling clay. Roll it into a ball. Round the edge. Cut a hole in the center. Put a bow on the top of the wreath. Allow the clay to air-dry or bake. Hang the completed clay wreath on your Christmas tree.
; ,, Leave for about 3 to 4 weeks to infuse, remembering to shake the potpourri every few days.  If the scent is strong enough to your liking, then it is ready to use. Transfer to decorative potpourri containers.	Mix the ingredients together in a large bowl. Put the mixture into a jar or tin and put the lid on.  , Put aside to infuse. Test.
To ensure that the decal paper adheres to the vase, the surface must be clean. Use rubbing alcohol on paper towel or a rag to wipe down the vase and remove any dirt and grime.   Decal paper adheres to most surfaces, so you can use a glass, plastic, or ceramic vase.  Do an image search to find leaf images that fit the design that you’re trying to create, and save them on your computer.You may need to resize the images, so it helps to have basic photo editing software.  When you’ve found the leaf images that you want to use, place some decal paper in your printer. Print the images out on the paper, so they’re ready for the vase.You can usually find decal paper at craft stores, office supply stores, and online retailers. If you’re not sure how to use the decal paper in your printer, consult the instructions on the packaging.  Once you’ve printed out the leaf images on the decal paper, use a pair of scissors to cut them out. Be as precise as possible as you cut to keep the leaf shapes as sharp as possible., After you’ve cut out the leaves, place the images in a large bowl of cold water. Allow them to soak for 30 seconds and remove from the water. That will help loosen the images from the backing paper so they’re ready to adhere to the vase.It’s best to soak just one or two images at time, so they don’t wind up soaking in the water for too long.  After you take the leaf images out of the water, gently peel away the paper backing. Place the images on the vase in whatever arrangement you prefer.Use your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles in the leaves. If the paper is starting to dry, run a damp rag over them to smooth  them into place.  Once you’ve added all of the leaves that you want to the vase, allow it to dry completely, which should take one to two hours. When the vase is dry, you can add ribbon and other embellishments or just set some flowers inside.If you want the vase to dry more quickly, you can use a hair dryer.	Clean the vase. Find leaf images online.The best place to find leaf images for your vase is online. Print the leaf images out on decal paper. Cut out the leaf images. Set the leaves in cold water. Remove the backing from the images and place on the vase. Let the vase dry.
You can use one of the Clan names from the series if you want. First you need to figure out a clan name like OakClan, FrostClan, FlameClan etc. If you want too you can be a loner, rouge or kittypet, but it's your choice.  So draw a cat or design one online, then figure out what type of cat you want like a tabby or maybe a calico something like that. Then figure out if you want to be elder, leader, warrior, medicine cat, queen, apprentice, or kit. Try being a leader if you want.  If you're a kit, it should be something like: BlackKit, MintKit, or FireKit. Say those three became Apprentices they would go from kit to paw like this: BlackPaw, MintPaw, and FirePaw. Then they became warriors from paw to something else like the first part of their name then what there first part of they're represents like: BlackClaw, MintLeaf, and FirePelt. Then say they became leader, it would change from they're last part of they're name to star like this: BlackStar, MintStar, and FireStar.  Ask your friends to be in your clan and if they want too but don't know what warriors is then make them a kit. Let them choose their rank. Unless they choose leader and you already have a leader., Ask your friends if they want to make they're own clan and let them make the name and do the rest., Make a border with pillows. Then make dens., Make it with one pillow on one side then make it where the top has to fit 2 pillows to cover it. Make it 2 pillows long so it can fit 2 people in it. The leaders mate or the leader and someone else.  If building the camp outdoors, use sticks, stones and logs in place of these pillows instead.  Make it tall and put the highrock on top of the den. In the outdoors, you'll have to use moss instead.,, Make this one a medium den. Make it 3 pillows long and 3 pillows wide. Now add the nests in columns or just next to each other. Put blankets next to the nests to cover the nest from the person next to them and pet a blanket on top of the den., Make this one 6 pillows long and 3 pillows wide. Now put blankets between the nests to cover the nests from the person next to them. Also put a blanket on top of the den., Make this one 4 pillows long and 3 pillows wide. Make the nests and put blankets between the nests to cover the nests from the people beside them. Now, put a blanket on top of the den., This den only needs to fit about 3-5 people in it so it should be 3 pillows long and 3 pillows wide. now place the nests and put the blankets between the nests and put a blanket on top of the den., This needs to fit four to five people in it. Make it four pillows wide and four pillows long. Put the nests down and put blankets between the nests and put a blanket on top of the den., Get a soft blanket or just soft cloth.	Think of a Clan name. Make your cat, your cat's name, and figure out what rank to be. Get clanmates. Get other clans. Grab pillows and blankets. Make the leader's den. Make the nests.Put a blanket on top of the den. Make the elders den. Make the warriors den. Make the apprentices den. Make the medicine cats' den. Make the nursery. Make the nests.
A metronome will often help keep rhythm as you go, if you are having trouble keeping a steady beat.   If you don't wish to clap, tapping your foot, or tapping your lap with your hand works just as good. The lap is great because you can practice keeping beat with one hand while tapping a harmonic rhythm with the other.      ; , Your aim is simply to copy the clapping. The more accurate you are, the more you'll be able to copy rhythms you hear.   Make sure they make their clapping progressively more advanced so you know at what stage you can still copy what you hear.  The advanced stuff should only be used once you have mastered the initial exercises.  Then respond but this time with playing your instrument instead.  Record yourself doing this then play it back. What were the results? If you're not sure, get someone with 'better ears' to comment and help out.   Do this regularly until you've developed an understanding of coming on time.	The simple way to develop your rhythm is with simple clapping exercises. Get someone, be it a friend, a family member, or a music teacher/tutor, to clap a simple tune/rhythm. Get someone to play a rhythmic melody (piano or any other instrument will do) and see if you can copy the rhythm played by clapping it out. For homework: When listening to your favourite music, try nodding to the beat, then clapping or clicking your fingers to time.
Glads often loose ground to weeds. , Use one that contains carbaryl or malathion when the gladiolas are around 6 inches (15 cm) tall to protect them from thrips.   Thrips are tiny insects not visible to the naked eye. They cause streaky white leaves and discolored, misshapen, unhealthy flowers. Thrip control must be preventative because once signs of damage are visible, it is too late to save the flowers.  You can also use stakes and twine to create cluster staking if you are growing several glads close together. Staking and tying these tall flowers helps to minimize storm and wind damage.  The remaining flowers will continue to open in water.   Harvest the flowers during early morning or evening hours when they are at their freshest. Cut the flowers with a sharp knife at a diagonal angle. Take care to leave at least 4 to 6 leaves on the plant to mature and nourish the corm that is still growing beneath the soil. ,	Mulch the soil around and between the plants to control weeds and conserve moisture. Water gladiola plants with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water each week during periods of insufficient rainfall.  , Spray or dust plants with a pesticide. Stake the individual plants as they grow taller. Cut the flower spikes when 1 to 3 florets are open. Remove leaves from the bottom 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of the stems and put them in warm water.  , Leave the flowers in a dark, cool area for several hours before exposing them to light and arranging and displaying them.
This will come with a huge power wire, a short ground wire, a remote wire, and many times an inline fuse and various connectors to help keep the install organized and looking clean. Some stereo shops have huge spools of wire available by the foot. This is another cost effective alternative to buying a wiring kit, if you know the dimensions of your car.; , You can find a hole somewhere in the bottom right of the firewall. Don't connect the power wire to the battery or the amp just yet.  You'll need to stay within 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) of the amplifier to maintain the best ground connection. A way you can do this is pull up the carpet and scrape the metal until it is bare metal with no paint left on it. If the amplifier is to be mounted in the trunk, many times bolts from the suspension can be found directly above one of the rear wheels. These suspension components usually bolt directly to the frame, making them an ideal grounding point.  There is a blue wire with a white stripe hanging out of the back of the deck known as the remote wire. The remote wire is a simple 12v signal that the cd player outputs to tell the amplifier to turn on. , If your cd player does not have a "Subwoofer Output", or if you are using a stock cd player, you will need a device called an inline converter. It's a small box that has 4 input wires and the 2 necessary RCA output that will run to the amplifier. It takes the high level speaker voltage and drops it to a low level signal the amplifier can process. The 4 input wires can be connected to the rear speakers (+ and - for left and right).  RCA cables should be run down the center of the car as RCA cables can pick up sounds from wire looms and also air con vents power wires.  Gauge isn't extremely important here, as long as the wire is copper, the resistance-per-foot is in the mili-ohm range, meaning there will be minuscule, if any, voltage drop across the wire.  There are many different types of enclosures (sealed, vented, bandpass, infinite baffle, etc.). There are numerous articles explaining the pros and cons of each type of enclosure, far too many to list in this article. If you really want the best response possible, your subwoofer manual will list the ideal enclosure volume for each type of enclosure. If you don't want to go through all of the volume calculations, just buy a box slightly bigger, and stuff it with pillow stuffing from walmart until the subs respond the way you want them to.  For example, if you have an amp that is 500w @ 4 ohms, and 1000w @ 2 ohms, you'll want to try to run your speakers at 2 ohms. Two 4 ohm subs can be wired in parallel to achieve this. If you're new to the impedance calculations, many amplifiers will have specific wiring diagrams in their manuals to assist.  If your amp kit came with an "inline fuse holder", you'll want to find a nice location to mount it in your engine bay. Once it's secure, cut a length of the power wire to reach the fuse, and connect it to one side of the fuse holder. The other side (the side you just cut) is stripped and connected to the other side of the fuse holder.  There's nice ring connectors and even new battery terminals you can buy (and sometimes come with the amp kit), that make the battery connection much more solid, and looks better too.  Then under the hood clamp the wire down to the battery. A word of warning, sometimes you'll see a nice big spark the first time you touch the power wire to the battery. Don't worry about it! This is the amplifier charging the huge capacitors contained inside.  This is where the output of the amplifier peaks and stays there for a split-second. This is bad for the subwoofer because it holds the cone (the big circle part!) in it's fully extended or fully compressed state for the duration of the clip. Not only are you not producing a single decibel of sound during this microsecond, but you're also working the voice coil very hard and damaging it. A good rule for beginners is to play a nice loud song of your genre at your cd players 3/4 volume setting. Now, with the gain at zero, turn it up until it's obvious that it isn't getting any louder. The gain knob isn't a "volume" knob by any means. A gain knob should usually never be at it's full position.	The most cost effective first step is to buy an amplifier wiring kit off of an internet auction site, etc. Run the 12v power wire (usually the longest wire in the kit, mostly red, typically ranges from 8 gauge to 0 gauge) from the battery through the firewall and then to the amp. Find a solid metal ground somewhere near the amplifier. Pull the aftermarket CD player out of the dash. Take your remote wire that came in your amp kit and splice/solder it onto that blue and white-striped wire and run it through the dash and then along the door jam.  , While you have the CD player removed, plug the RCA white and red plugs into the back of the deck where it says "Subwoofer Output.", Run all the wires straight back to the amplifier.you should run the power and remote control down the right as factory speaker wires run down the left due to fire risks if the power cable shorts out and you have your speaker cables down the same side it will blow your head deck (cd player). Use Speaker Wire to connect sub-woofers to amplifier. Hopefully by now you have a subwoofer box/enclosure. Be sure to know the impedance of the subwoofer(s) you are using and try to match the amplifier's impedance accordingly. Put a fuse into 12v wire in the engine bay no more than 0.5m away from battery. Connect the power wire to your battery. Lastly, connect the battery cable to the amplifier. Do not turn up the volume or gain too high or you may produce clipping in the subwoofers.

Pull the spool pin up so that it is completely vertical. Sit the spool of thread on this pin.   Position the spool so that the thread winds clockwise around it. Pass the thread around the bobbin winding tension disc on top of the machine.; , Pass the tail end of the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin.   The thread should pass through the hole from the inside. The tail of the thread should end up on the outside of the bobbin. Only pass the thread through the upper hole. Do not pass it through the bottom hole.  Place the bobbin onto the winding shaft, then slide the shaft to the right.   Use your hands to gently twist the bobbin clockwise. After a slight rotation, you should see the spring on the bobbin winding shaft click into the slit along the side of the bobbin.  Lightly tap your foot on the foot controller of the machine. Allow the the thread to wind around the bobbin a few times.   Hold the tail end of the thread with one hand as you do this. Take your foot off the controller and stop the machine after the thread is partially wrapped around the bobbin. Do not wait until the bobbin is full before releasing the controller.  Once the thread is secure on the bobbin, trim the tail coming out from the top hole. Step on the presser foot again to finish winding the bobbin.   The machine should stop on its own once the bobbin is completely full. Do not touch the balance wheel as the bobbin winds. The wheel will turn during this time, and you should not disturb or attempt to stop it.  Once the machine stops, cut the thread connecting the bobbin to the rest of the spool.   Push the bobbin winding shaft back to the left and lift the full bobbin off. Note that if the bobbin is wound improperly, the thread tension could loosen as you sew and break the needle. The thread on the finished bobbin should look tight and even. This step completes the bobbin winding portion of the process.  Turn the balance wheel toward you, moving it counterclockwise, until it reaches its highest position.   Raise the presser foot lifter to lift the presser foot, as well.  Open the shuttle cover to reveal the bobbin case. Pull on the bobbin case latch, pulling the case straight out through the front of the machine.   The shuttle cover is located along the front side of the machine, beneath the needle and behind the extension table.  Slip the loaded bobbin into the bobbin case so that the thread comes up from beneath the bobbin.   Unwind about 4 inches (10 cm) of thread from the bobbin before attempting to insert it into the case. Hold the bobbin case so that the latch points down and toward you. The thread should be directed toward the top of the bobbin case as you slip the bobbin inside. When viewed from the front, the thread should appear to wind around the bobbin in a clockwise rotation. If the bobbin is loaded in the wrong direction, the thread tension will be incorrect and you may end up breaking the machine needle as you attempt to sew.  Pull the tail of the bobbin thread through the slit at the top of the case. Draw it down and to the left, working it into the delivery eye.   The delivery eye is located just beneath the tension spring of the case.  Hold the bobbin case by the latch and slip it into the shuttle race of the machine. Release the latch once the bobbin case in in place.   You will need to make sure that your index finger lines up with the top opening of the shuttle race as you push the bobbin case inside. A properly loaded bobbin case should snap into the machine. It will fall out if placed improperly or insecurely.  If you have not done so already, lift the presser foot lifter up, releasing the presser foot and bringing it to its highest position.  If necessary, you should also turn the balance wheel at the side of the machine toward you in a counterclockwise rotation. Continue turning the wheel until the thread take-up lever at the front of the machine is in its highest position.   Only pay attention to the position of this lever; do not worry about the position of the needle. This lever will be positioned above the needle and should have a small notch in it.  Lift the spool pin to its vertical position and rest the spool of thread on it.   Position the spool so that the thread appears to wrap around it in a counterclockwise rotation.  Pull the thread from the spool, drawing it through the rear thread guide at the top of the machine, followed by the front thread guide at the top of the machine.   The rear thread guide is directly next to the bobbin tension disc. Simply slip the thread into the gap of the guide. The front thread guide is a small notch directly in front of the rear guide. Slide the thread through that notch. Note that there should be a diagram on the top of the machine to help guide you as you thread the needle.  Slip the thread down into the right channel at the front of the machine.   At the bottom of the right channel, wrap the thread around the upper tension control dial. The thread should pass from right to left, picking up the thread check spring and slipping into the thread tension discs behind the dial. Grab the thread on both sides of the tension dial. Gently tug on both sides to make sure that the thread is firmly in place.  Draw the thread up through the left channel at the front of your machine. Bring it all the way to the back of the channel, then slip it into the eyelet of the thread take-up lever peeking out from inside the channel.   Pull the thread through the eyelet, moving from right to left. After successfully trapping the thread inside the eyelet, draw the thread back down through the left channel again.  Slip the thread down and position it behind the wire thread guide just above the needle.  Insert the thread into the needle. Bring the thread through the front of the eye and out through the back.   Once the thread is successfully inserted through the needle, pull out a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Position this tail behind the needle, pointing toward the back of the machine.  If the two are not already in their highest positions, take a moment to make sure that both the presser foot and needle are as high as possible.   To raise the presser foot, simply lift up the presser foot lever/lifter. To raise the needle, turn the balance wheel on the right side of the machine counterclockwise, toward yourself, until the needle sits in its highest position.  Turn the balance wheel toward yourself again in a full rotation. The needle should move all the way down and all the way back up.   Hold the tail of the upper thread as you do this. Keep the thread taut, but do not put pressure on the needle. Note that needle must be threaded and the bobbin must be loaded during this process. During this rotation, the upper thread should catch the lower bobbin thread in a loop.  Gently tug on the thread inserted through your needle. Continue tugging until the thread looped around it pops up enough for you to grab it.   This extra loop of thread comes from the bobbin. Once you can grab the loop, pull it out into a straight tail. If you cannot grab it with your fingers, use a small screwdriver, pencil, or similar object to draw the loop out.  Pull on both pieces of thread until you have tails measuring roughly 6 inches (15 cm) long. Let both of these tails hang off from the back of the sewing machine.   Make sure that the upper thread passes in between the "toes" of the presser foot. With the completion of this step, the Brother LS 2125i sewing machine is fully threaded and ready to use.	Place the spool on the spool pin. Draw the thread through the bobbin hole. Sit the bobbin on the bobbin winding shaft. Press the foot controller. Trim the excess thread and continue winding. Cut the remaining thread. Raise the needle. Remove the bobbin case. Slide the bobbin into the bobbin case. Maneuver the thread into the delivery eye. Place the bobbin case in the machine. Raise the presser foot. Raise the thread take-up lever. Sit the spool on the spool pin. Pass the thread through both upper thread guides. Pull the thread down. Guide the thread up and around the take-up lever. Pass the thread behind the thread guide. Thread the needle from front to back. Raise the presser foot and needle. Turn the balance wheel toward you. Pull the upper thread toward you. Position both tails behind the machine.
First off, you have to pick a fandom that you'll be doing the AMV for. Your AMV subject could be one of several things. You could choose to focus on a particular character (Character AMV), a pairing (Shipping AMV), a group of characters (Multiple-Character AMV), the entire anime (perhaps pride for that fandom or a particular theme?), or you could get creative and do a crossover AMV featuring characters from more than one anime. Whatever you want! The choice is yours. However, you'll probably want to chose a fandom, character, or pairing that you are familiar with and is popular enough to be noticed by others in the fandom.; , A good AMV uses a song that fits closely with the subject and describes it almost perfectly, Otherwise the video itself will have to be put together in such a way that IT fits the song. If someone can react by saying "wow! This song is practically his/her/their/its theme song!", then you have chosen a song well. Sometimes, you might simply be listening to or thinking about a particular song, and suddenly have a Eureka moment in which you realize that that song would be perfect for a particular fandom/pairing/character. Use your judgement. Once you have your song, it would help to listen to that song on repeat (consider listenonrepeat . com) for long periods of time. This will help inspire you and give you ideas for what you want to do for the AMV.  This includes the song's audio and the images/clips. Look up a good website or program that can (legally!) allow you to download the audio for the song you plan to use. You will want to do the same for episodes of the anime, if you plan to use actual video clips from the anime itself. Besides video clips, you can also use still images for the AMV, such as screenshots of episodes, portions of the manga (if the anime has one, which most animes do), fanart, official designs, or, if given permission, screenshots of others' AMVs. Save these all to your computer in a place where you will be able to access them later.  Again, you will have to decide for yourself what you want to do here. Find a program on which you can make and edit slideshows and videos. Create a file on that program and title it whatever you plan to name your AMV.  This is where you add the song audio and video clips and/or images that you plan to use. Pick images/clips that you feel fit the theme and subject of the AMV, as well as those that match the lyrics and mood of the song. Again: use your judgement. You should have figured out by now what effect you are trying to go for, and should select images and clips accordingly.  This might be the hardest step. This is where that skill and patience and practice comes in. Now, you should edit the duration and order of the different images/clips you have selected to correspond with the effect you're trying to go for. Timing is everything. A good AMV will have images corresponding well with the song. A great AMV will have good timing and correspond the images with the lyrics and rhythm of the song. That takes practice. Your first AMV will probably be poorly put-together. But your following AMVs will get better and better. This step is also where you put in transitions and motions and all that stuff to make your video fun and enjoyable and nice to watch.  When you feel like everything is the way you want it to be, watch your AMV all the way through several times, without editing it. Do this several times. Chances are that you're going to notice a few things that you don't like, something you want to change, something you forgot to include, or something that needs to be fixed. Take note of these things, then when you've watched it all the way to the end, go back and fix those things. Every time you fix the AMV, watch it again at least two more times to see if anything else needs fixing. Repeat as often as necessary. When you've watched it all the way through about five or more times in a row without changing anything, then it's time to.  Now that you're satisfied with your AMV, you can upload it. YouTube is probably the best option. But if there is another site that you like to upload videos to, then go right ahead. The uploading processes vary from site to site and from program to program, so read up on how uploading works for your site and program of choice.  This last step varies slightly from site to site. But it's mostly the same: choosing a title, editing tags and the description. One thing to be sure to include in your video description are credits and disclaimers. If you used artwork that isn't yours, say so and give credit to artists that want to be credited. Include the name and artist of the song.	Pick your subject. Pick your song. Get the video components. Make a file for your AMV. Start adding stuff!, Edit edit edit!, Watch your AMV over and over. Upload!, Finish up.
Use a tape measure to determine the distance between the curtain rod and the floor.   Add 5 inches/12.7 cm to this number to account for the curtain's hem. If the distance between the curtain rod and the floor is 120 inches/3.05m, the result is 125 inches/3.18m. Add 8 inches/20.3 cm to the total to account for the tabs on the curtain. If the curtain and hem total 125 inches/3.18m, you now have a length of 133 inches/3.38m.  Use a tape measure to determine how wide the area is that you want covered. Include the amount of wall around the window that you want covered in the measurement.   Multiply the measurement by 1.25. If your original width was 24 inches/61cm, the cut fabric will need to have a total width of 30 inches/76cm.  Cut the fabric according to the required length and width indicated by the measurements.  Place the curtain on a flat surface. The wrong side of the fabric should face upward.   Fold a 1-inch/2.5cm hem along the bottom and top of the curtain. The hem should fold up against the wrong side of the fabric. Use a needle and thread that matches the curtains to secure the hem with a whipstitch. A whipstitch is a shallow stitch that enters through the folded fabric, exits through the main part of the curtain, and enters again through the folded fabric. Whipstitch the entire length of the fold. Fold another 3-inch/7.5cm hem along the top of the curtain. Secure the hem with a whipstitch.  Determine how long you want the tabs on the curtain to be. If you want the tabs to be 4 inches/10cm long, you will need a piece of fabric that is 8 inches/20cm long. Cut the fabric according to the width of the curtain and the desired height of the tabs.   Place the length of fabric on a flat surface. The wrong side of the fabric should face up. Fold the fabric in half. You will now have a long tube of fabric from which you will cut the tabs. Place the edges of the folded fabric on top of the 3-inch/7.5cm hem at the top of the curtain. Use safety pins to pin the fabric to the hem.  Determine how many tabs you want on the curtain. There should be no more than 5 inches/12.5cm between each tab.   Use scissors to cut spaces evenly from the long tube of fabric. Ensure that you do not cut through the curtain attached to the tube of fabric. You now have individual tabs secured to the curtain with safety pins. Check that there is a tab on each side edge of the curtain. Use a sewing machine to secure the edges of the tabs to the hem of the curtain.  Loop the tabs around the curtain rod. Place the curtain rod into the hooks above the window. Done!	Measure the length of the curtain. Measure the width of the curtain. Cut the fabric. Hem the curtain. Secure the long tab. Make the tabs. Hang the curtain.
This will depend on the location of the bulb and how safely you can access the light to clean it.  Lamps can be turned off at the power point to be absolutely sure. In each case, the bulb must be cool or cold to the touch.  There are various methods below that you can try.  If it's really dirty, brush the dirt into a plastic bag rather than letting it fall to the floor.; , Rub gently over the bulb and collect the dust. There is no need to apply pressure.  Wring out excess liquid.    If wiping a lamp, turn off at the power point first.  You may want to give it 10-15 minutes to dry. (The time may also depend on the size of the bulb or on the amount of water content used)  , Wring out excess liquid; it should be damp, not soaking. , Let it dry. When you reuse the bulb, a lovely odor will waft forth (provided the bulb is warm to hot).	Decide whether it's easiest to clean the bulb in position or removed from the socket. Switch off all lights before removing or cleaning them. Choose a method for cleaning the light bulb. Dust with a feather duster. Wipe the bulb with a dry lint-free cloth. Dampen a cloth. Wipe over a cool bulb. Let dry completely before using the bulb again. Dampen a cloth. Pour a few drops of your favorite essential oil onto the damp cloth.  , Wipe over the bulb.
It is difficult to predict if the venue will be too warm or too cold, though you can usually bet on it being hot if it’s going to be a huge, crowded concert. To keep warm on your way to and from the concert during colder months, wear layers, such as a t-shirt with a bomber jacket over it. The bomber jacket is lightweight but will keep you warm if you need it. It can also be easily tied around your waist if you choose to ditch it in the middle of the concert.If you are attending a more subdued concert, it may be cooler inside the venue than you may expect. Wear either a lightweight jacket or a thick sweater over a shirt to ensure you stay warm during the concert, if you need to. Attending a concert is a great excuse to break out one of your favorite band t-shirts.  Lively concerts will often have everyone dancing and even moshing. Protect your feet and toes by wearing a pair of sturdy, yet stylish boots. If attending a rock or pop concert, try a pair of combat boots, which are stylish while still being heavy duty enough to protect your feet and keep them warm, if necessary. If you are attending a country concert, you can simply wear your favorite pair of cowboy boots. A concert in which everyone will be seated for the majority of the time will not necessarily require you to wear closed-toe shoes.  You will want to incorporate powder into your makeup routine to stay looking fresh throughout the concert. Stay away from liquid and glossy products, as they will fade quickly as you sweat and could even smear. Finish off your look with a translucent setting powder to ensure that your makeup stays and does not rub off as you sweat. Keep the powder with you in your bag so that you can touch up as needed.   Opt for a powder foundation, such as Bare Minerals, to ward off shine throughout the concert.	Wear layers. Choose comfortable, closed-toe shoes. Apply sweat-proof makeup.
Place a covering around the area in which you plan to remove the blackberry plant. This can make clean up easier and minimize the risk of seeds or stems escaping and forming new plants.   Use trash bags or tarps to cover the area to till.; , Using your hands or a pair of heavy-duty garden scissors to cut the stems of the blackberry plant. This will make it easier for you to remove the roots and source of life for the plant., Using the covering you used around the blackberry bush, bundle the stems together. Then dispose of the stems in your garbage or a place in which they are not exposed to the soil to prevent regrowth.Make sure to get every bit of stem off of the ground because a new bush can still grow even from a short cutting.Check with your community to inquire about local regulations on disposing of organic plant material.  Once you’ve removed the stems, you can more easily access the root ball. Using a trowel or shovel, dig the surrounding soil until you expose the entire root ball.Make sure to dig around the root ball so that you don’t break it up and potentially release seeds or stems into the soil.Be aware that digging up the root ball will not kill the plant since some plant material may remain, but this does make tilling the soil much easier., Gently take the root ball out from the soil around which you’ve dug a hole. Not only can this ensure easier tilling, but can also remove a major source of rhizomes that can propagate the bush.However, keep in mind that blackberry plants do not form a tight root ball like some other plants and the roots can run a long way underground. Follow the roots to the ends and then carefully dig them up with a trowel.   Use gloves when you remove the root ball to minimize the risk of cutting yourself. Dig further around the root ball if it doesn’t come out when you pull on it. This may allow you to get most bits of root in one movement. Dispose of the root ball in the same way you did the stems.  It’s important to till, or break up and turn over, the soil after removing the stems and root balls.This can help remove or starve any material, including rhizomes, which are also called rootstocks, that can propagate further plants.   Use a cultivator fork or deep spade to turn over and break up soil in small areas.You can purchase these at most home improvement and hardware stores. Rent an engine-powered tiller for larger areas. You can rent (or buy) these at home improvement and hardware stores.Be sure that you’ve broken up and turned over your soil by examining it. The soil will often look darker if it’s come from under the surface. If you do not want to till the soil, then you can also just mow over any shoots that do come up. This will weaken the plants and stop the shoots from coming up.  Use a heavy layer of plastic to cover the soil and minimize the risk of more blackberries growing.Then cover the plastic with 4-5 inches of mulch to further deter growth., Follow up your removal and tilling with frequent care of your soil. Repeating your tilling efforts can minimize the number of plantlets and eventually kill all of your blackberries.Till once a week or any time you see plantlets. Eventually, the blackberry plants will die.	Cover the area around the plant. Cut the stems. Bundle the stems for disposal. Dig up the root ball. Remove the root ball. Till the soil. Cover the soil. Repeat tilling.
In general, the least toxic cleaner is best for cement. Start with a mild cleanser, like detergent, and work your way up to chemical cleaners if necessary. Chemicals can wear cement down, so they should be avoided unless absolutely necessary., When using an acid-based cleaner, never pour add the acid to a bucket first and then the water. You should add the water followed by the acid. Doing so the other way around can cause a dangerous reaction., Many people use push brooms to target cement floors. However, push brushes are actually less effective than deck brushes. The bristles are too long to effectively remove dirt and debris from cement.If you don't have a deck brush, buy one at a hardware store.	Start with less toxic cleaners. Do not pour water into acid. Use a deck brush over a push broom.
Coffee shops, outdoor seating at restaurants, or your own easy chair are great places to settle in and enjoy reading your chosen paper. If you take the train to work, you can also read it there, on your way.; , If you’re reading relaxation or pleasure, then you’re approach might be less structured. If you’re looking for a specific topic or for reading practice, you’ll need to be more organized.   Most English-language newspapers are written at range of reading levels, from about fifth grade to college level, so you should focus on the articles and sections that will probably fit your purpose. For example, the film reviews will be easier, and faster, reading, while reports on complicated economic topics might be more challenging and take more time.Reading a paper to practice a foreign language will help you learn about the issues that are important to speakers of that language and as well as to engage in the culture and learn new vocabulary., After you’ve gotten a sense of the overall paper, choose the section or article that has caught your attention, based on your reading purpose. You might choose a headline article on the front page, or you might skip to another section and begin reading sports. Use the table of contents as your guide.   The editorial section contains opinionated articles rather than strictly factual news, such as the “Opinion” section in the Detroit Free Press, which may offer editorial perspectives on universal healthcare or the War on Terror.The lifestyle section usually has stories about the arts and commerce. Forbes, for example, may have articles about new movies, popular car models, and travel ideas.The entertainment section includes movie and theater reviews, as well as interviews with authors and artists and information about art galleries and other local and national events. Similarly, the sports section will report box scores from sports currently in season, and may include personal stories about players, coaches, or issues in the athletic world, such as the concussion problem in the NFL., If you’re in a crowded space, like a train, fold your newspapers into quadrants for easier reading and less worry about bothering other people.You might find it easier to separate the various sections, usually marked by a letter, and deal with them one at a time, rather than trying to keep all of the pages in order. Folding a newspaper correctly is optional, although if you’re passing it on to another person, it’s courteous to put all of the sections back in place when you’re done.  Newspaper articles are usually written in an "inverted pyramid" structure, which means that the most significant information appears at the start of the story, rather than the end, followed by the details in order of importance. The first sentence, called the "lead" or "lede," is designed to catch readers' attention and provide the major details of the story to entice them to read further.Sidebars near significant stories offer analysis for understanding the "why" of the story. Read them first to have some context for the ideas.You can also read the articles’ subheadings or callout quotes, if available, for an overview of major topics and notable comments in the story.  Read the first few paragraphs, as these will contain the primary points of the article, and you’ll be able to determine if you want to continue reading it. Read the rest of the article or move to a new one if you’ve lost interest or if it doesn’t provide any information that you find worthwhile.   Don’t be afraid to jump to a new article or section if your purpose is satisfied or if you need a break from a difficult topic. For example, you may find reading too much about domestic violence is too distressing for a relaxing read, so you can decide to save an article about an upcoming domestic violence court case for later. Once you’ve finished with a section, you can set it aside as you find a new place to begin previewing and reading. By the time you’ve read all or most of the sections, you should feel a sense of satisfaction as you collect that new pile of papers for recycling or reuse.  When you're reading the editorial section, or the "op-ed" (opposite the editorial page), remember that you're reading the opinions of those writers, and not necessarily straight facts. Before you begin, you should read the article title to get an idea of the topic, and then take a moment to consider your own opinion first.Even though the news section is strictly informational, being aware of your own opinions and biases before reading those articles will help you to be more open minded about difficult topics. Try reading opinion pieces that are in opposition to your own views. Even if you don't agree, you might learn something new, whether it's a different way to defend your opinion, or a new perspective on the issue altogether.  Even if you’re reading to relax, taking a moment to see the relationship between the articles you're reading and your own experiences or concerns can lead to a more enjoyable experience. Ask yourself: “Can I connect the ideas or events that I’m reading about to my own life and the other stories I’ve read about this topic?”Making connections between your TV news and Internet video clips and a printed newspaper will help you to become even more informed about the topic and engaged as a citizen., Sometimes, you may want to read a particularly long newspaper, like the Sunday edition, or you may have a requirement for a course in school. If you have limited time but you want to read the whole paper, your strategy will be different than if you need to read specific sections for an assignment.   If you need or want to read the entire paper, but have only a small window of time, plan to use previewing and skimming strategies. If you have an assignment or a particular topic you're interested in reading about, then you'll be focused on the finding only the appropriate articles quickly and reading them carefully.  The front page section is the most valuable “real estate” in the paper, and the editors reserve it for the biggest or most popular stories. Reading the headlines will give you an idea of the most important happenings, either locally, nationally, or internationally, and the images are chosen to establish the central or most interesting idea in a given story.   This overview should take about three minutes, and you'll have a better idea of where you want to start., The most important story, by long newspaper tradition, should appear at the top right of the front page. The second-most important story will appear at the top left. Also, editors use larger type for "bigger" stories.Checking the table of contents, if you're looking for a particular topic, section, or article, will save you time, since you won't have to search the newspaper blindly. Some newspapers include mini-headlines at the very top of the page to catch readers' attention for stories in interior sections of the paper, such as sports or entertainment.<  , Each time you begin a new article, read just the first paragraph or two. Newspaper articles always start with a "lede" or "lead," which contains the most important information. The rest of the article fills out the story with details, in order of importance. If you're reading efficiently, the first paragraph should give you enough information for a general understanding of the topic.   If something in an article catches your attention, keep reading, but be ready to move on if your curiosity is satisfied. If you're reading for an assignment, use the lede to help you set up your summary notes, as it's the "Main Idea" of the passage. Articles should answer the questions: "Who? What? Where? How?," so use those questions to structure your notes, if necessary.  If an article in full contains a "jump line," or instructions to continue the story on another page, complete that story on the new page, and then return to the original section to continue reading. Avoid starting on the new page and possibly wasting time later trying to remember which articles you'd forgotten to read in earlier sections.   You can also simply skim all of the articles, especially if you're in a hurry but want to get a snapshot of the main ideas. If you're reading for an assignment, or if you have a particular subject of interest, you can also scan all of the articles for key words of your topic. You can then read just those articles more carefully.  If you have space and want the encouragement that you're reading at a good pace, setting the completed sections aside will provide you with a tangible reminder of your accomplishments.  Local newspapers, both dailies and weeklies, can connect you to your community’s residents, politics, and happenings, and will be written by local writers with a vested interest in your area. These papers tend to have more reporter-initiated stories rather than mostly stories based on national news, which means they’re more proactive and less “reactive” in nature.Some local news are daily, while others are weekly or bi-weekly. Weekly newspapers will be even more community-centered, since they have more time to fully develop and research local stories. Local newspapers will employ not only writers from your community, but they will also use community members as sources, and so you may find the stories even more relevant to your own life.  National news outlets, such as USA Today or The Guardian, will include stories with wider appeal, but many of the stories will be wire-service pieces, such as those from the Reuters or the Associate Press (AP). They’ll include information on national weather trends and major political stories, and they’re more likely to have a significant online presence.   Some very large metro-area newspapers, such as The LA Times or the Chicago Tribune, can be a good blend of local news stories and significant national coverage. National news outlets may offer more perspectives on many issues, as their staff writers might be located throughout the country, rather than in a single city.  International newspaper outlets can provide you with a new look at familiar issues or a chance to learn about a different culture. The newspapers of each country or region present their stories from the viewpoint of it’s culture, highlighting the values and positive attributes of that area of the world. If you read critically, you can pay attention to that bias, as well as your own, and gain a new understanding of the truth of a story.Some bias exists in popular newspapers, such as Russia Today and the Australian Associated Press, reporting on war and conflicts, primarily through either overreporting or underreporting of violence. Other issues arise from oversimplification of complicated national and international issues., If you want the top stories, with up-to-the minute information and links to other perspectives on the same issues, try a digital newspaper edition. For possibly more in-depth coverage, including more editorializing or responses from other readers such as letters to the editor, go for print.Not all local papers will have comparable online coverage. For instance, the Community Impact News in Texas, includes only some stories on their website, though they have enormous local print circulation.Some newspapers, particularly national and international papers, will charge a subscription fee for online access. For example, the New York Times charges from $1.88-$8.75 a week for a subscription, depending on your level of access. Some online news sites, even those with print editions, may use inadequate research and intentionally misleading tactics to encourage traffic to their sites., Newspapers are a mix of factual news and opinionated editorials. A news reporter should offer as many validated and researched facts as available, and an editorial should be clearly marked in a particular section of the paper. Check for credible sources and inappropriate stereotypes in headlines and stories.Ask yourself: “Who is telling the story?” If a story about the economy focuses on stockbrokers instead of the everyday people affected by a recession, the newspaper may not only be biased, but also out of touch with its readers.Find out more about the editorial staff and writers. Do they represent the diversity of the community that they serve? If not, then the stories may show further evidence of bias, particularly on coverage of news on parts of the community not represented at the paper.	Find a comfortable place to read your paper. Decide your reading purpose. Decide where you want to begin. Fold your paper so that you can read easily and comfortably. Preview the section you’ve chosen to read. Choose the article that you want to read and begin. Determine your own opinion and note your own biases. Connect your reading to your own life and other news sources. Decide how much of the newspaper you want to read. Skim the headlines and pictures on all of the pages, one at a time. Start on the first page. Read the first paragraphs of the articles. Read every article in a section. Set aside each section as you complete it. Choose a local newspaper if you want more community engagement. Choose a national newspaper if you want wider coverage of national issues. Choose an international or foreign paper to discover new perspectives. Decide if you want to read a physical newspaper or an online version. Choose a newspaper that presents the news honestly and the opinions separately.
Make the structure to appear bulging. , One should be in front (erase horizontal line overlapping the chimney in step two) and one at the back of the pointy roof.  Make the upper portion of the window curvy. Draw a circular window for the attic and draw rectangular windows on the lower part of the house. Remember to make the two windows in front larger. This will create an illusion that these windows are nearer to the viewer. , This adds mystery to our drawing.  Make the trees pointy and crooked.  The windows could also be colored white but coloring it yellow creates a spooky feel which makes it perfect for a haunted house. Now the haunted house is complete. Boo!	Draw an outline of the house. Draw a horizontal line and a vertical line to create a roof and a partition.  , Draw two chimneys. Draw two windows on the lower roof. Draw a triangular shape below the roof.  , Make the door slightly opened. A haunted house would not be complete without dead trees. Now we can add colors to our outline.
Either use rainwater or let the water stand so the chlorine can evaporate out. You don't want to kill the beneficial micro-organisms, which is the point of municipal chlorine. Using a bubbler will speed up the release of Cl- ions from the water, cutting down the time the water needs to stand.; , This will serve as food for the micro-organisms. It helps to dissolve the molasses in a small volume (like half a cup) of hot water before adding it to the bucket. This prevents potential obstruction of your air bubblers.  The knotted end of the bag can be hung down and submerged so the tea bag is situated above the rising bubbles. Some simply dump the teabag in. putting the castings directly in the bucket (with no tea bag) if you plan to use a watering can anyway, otherwise, straining through cheesecloth or mesh may be necessary when using backpack-type sprayer with nozzles that could clog easily with debris and detritus.  Casting particles in sizes larger than marbles, or even bark mulch. Others are finely ground castings, smaller than ball bearings. The difference in total surface area exposed to water is much larger for the finely ground which has more exposure to the aerated water.  Some people say put the castings in an old sock or stocking hose that has no holes and tie the opening closed. This does not allow the castings to exchange into the water freely and slows the growth of the micro critters. Both ways give satisfactory results with the castings right in the water. Also, slime mould formations which are micro critter super colonies, may form. This shows the intense populations of tea made this way. You can use a plastic watering can without the strainer on the end and apply the tea in total - castings and all.  Place it in the the bucket and hold the air stone to the bottom with a rock. Plug in the bubbler so the the water is aerated.  If you don't have a bubbler, consider stirring occasionally- don't worry you cannot hurt the micro critters (microbes) by stirring. The air stone at the bottom of the bucket will cause the tea to be in constant mix - this is the best way to get a high yield tea.  The microorganisms from the digestive system of the worm are extruded in their castings. These aerobic (oxygen-dependent) microbes are "good" microbes for plants (nature's way). Bad microbes are typically anaerobic (oxygen kills them) and many give off offensive odors as they release byproducts of metabolism like hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell). Aerating the tea improves conditions (agitation, circulation, aeration) for the good microbes, which enhance (survival, reproduction, growth). Aeration helps suppress the presence or growth of bad "bugs" that will compete against the good ones. Use of a bubbler helps along dissolution of the molasses food as well; it dissolves and diffuses more rapidly. Some instructions for tea setups without a bubbler recommend up to three days of brewing.  Exponential populations in limited spaces eventually peak and then plunge with massive population loss. We want the tea to be biologically active, alive, with good microbes like Bacillus subtilis. To avoid losing the beneficial microorganisms you created, use the worm compost tea as soon as possible.  Non-pleasing odors from the tea after initial brewing or prolonged refrigeration may signal a low quality brew which should probably be dumped. This could be added to a composter or wormery to prevent waste.	Fill a 5-gallon bucket with water. Add the corn syrup or molasses to the water. Place castings in the bucket by either:   putting the castings into a thin mesh "teabag" of pantyhose or a similarly sheer sock and knotting the end. Realize the grade or particle sizes of your choice of castings (determined by source and packaging process) play a role in making this choice. Put the worm castings in directly into the bucket. Use a bubbler like an aquarium pump and air stone if you have one. Let water and castings bubble (or at least soak) for 24 hours. To produce high yield tea, conditions should be desirable for the microbes to proliferate, multiplying exponentially. Use within 48 hours. Refrigerate (in a sealed, labeled container) for up to 3 days.
Cement-based grout is the most commonly used form of grout, and is also the most cost-effective of grouts available for use. Epoxy is more expensive, more difficult to install, and harder to find, so it might not be worth the effort when making your decision. But to counter its cons, it has pros of being more durable and having greater resistance to chemical and water damage., Adding sand isn’t a crucial component to grout picks, but it is advised for tiles that have spaces in between them greater than 1/8 inch. It makes grout more resistant to shrinking and cracking which is a must for bigger tile space areas., For lighter coloured grout on floors, pick a grout colourant that includes a sealant. Sealing grout combats the high traffic and moisture kitchen and bathroom areas might receive and protect the grout for much longer. Stay away from “membrane-forming” sealers and invest in breathable “penetrating” sealers instead., Darker grouts can hide stains and dirt more easily than lighter shades, but are more likely to show staining and fading from harsh cleansers. Lighter grouts tend to show more dirt. Lean towards shades that are not super light but are not super dark either.	Decide between cement or epoxy based grout. Add sand to your grout. Include a sealing grout. Choose between light shades and dark shades.
After your beds are planted, you can give them an attractive edge using stones, logs, or bricks.  For a uniquely beautiful rustic garden border, try making a woven wood garden border.This can be done by weaving pruned raspberry canes along bamboo supports, using a basic basket-weaving technique.  Giving your garden a rustic touch can be as simple as adding a few repurposed tools and objects.You might try:  Putting a planter in a wheelbarrow. Lining up some flower pots on an old wooden bench. Leaning some vintage garden or farm tools (like rakes or pitchforks) against a wall and allowing vines to creep up them. Placing flower pots on the rungs of a wooden step-ladder.  A winding path is a beautiful and welcoming addition to a garden. While garden paths can be made with pavers or concrete, a more informal and truly rustic effect can be achieved with one of the following:Stepping stones. This will look most natural if you use unfinished, irregular slabs of stone. Ideally, your stones should be 12-18 inches (30.5-45.7 cm) across, and about 2 inches (5 cm) thick. You can get stones like these from a landscape supplier. Gravel or mulch. For this kind of path, all you need is some landscape fabric to put underneath your material, and metal or plastic edging to keep it in place.  Birdhouses are beautiful in themselves, and will also attract birds to your garden. Birdhouses can be installed on fences or walls in your garden, or set on a post or upright log installed in one of your flower beds.You might encourage vines or other climbing plants to grow up around your birdhouse. Don’t forget to install a couple of bird feeders, as well.	Give your flower beds a decorative border. Decorate with repurposed objects. Add a stone or gravel path. Install birdhouses.
Every vehicle has specific points on the frame that were designed to withstand the stress of jacking up the vehicle. These jack points are not always easily identified, so refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to help you find them if you are having difficulty.There are commonly jack points on the frame of your car to the inside of each wheel, and at a center point on the front and back of the car. Jacking the car up at a point that is not designed for it can bend the frame of your car and cause significant damage.  Trolley jacks utilize hydraulics to lift your vehicle off of the ground. When the hydraulic valve is open, the jack will not create pressure on the piston and it will fail to raise your car. Use the handle of the jack or a pair of pliars to turn the valve clockwise until it is completely closed. Re-insert the handle into the jack once done if you used the handle to close the valve. Different jacks may place the valve in different places, but it is often a different color than the rest of the jack or is left unpainted completely. The valve is usually located on the end of the jack that faces you while in operation.  Slide your trolley jack beneath the jack point you’ve identified so the cup of the jack is sitting just beneath it. You may need to raise the cup of the jack slightly by lifting the jack handle and pressing it back down once to make sure the jack is positioned properly.The cup on the jack should be centered on the designated jack point for the vehicle. There are teeth or ridges on the cup of the jack to help prevent the car’s frame from sliding as it’s jacked up.  Depending on the style and size of the trolley jack you are using, you may need to lift up the handle and press it toward the floor a number of times to jack up the car. Start slow, paying close attention to the frame around the jack point to look for signs of bending or crimping of the metal. Once you have lifted the car a few inches, you should be able to easily determine if the jack point is supporting the weight of the vehicle.It may take a good deal of force to press the handle of the jack toward the ground as it raises the car. If you see signs that the metal is bending, lower the car and reposition the jack unto the jack point properly.  As you raise your car higher, you increase the risk associated with it falling off of the jack, as well as the likelihood that the jack itself will fall over or fail. If you are jacking the car up to change a tire, raise it only so the tire is barely off of the ground. If you need to get under the vehicle, ensure your jack can safely raise the vehicle to the height you intend.Trolley jacks have the maximum height and weight they are rated for on the packaging, and often on the body of the jack in the form of a sticker. Do not jack a car up until the arm of the trolley jack is standing straight up. It should always be slightly slanted.	Locate the appropriate jack points for your vehicle. Ensure the valve on the jack is closed. Slide the jack beneath the jack point. Raise and lower the handle of the jack to lift the vehicle. Lift the vehicle only as high as necessary.
Sometimes a mixtape will just be some of your favorite songs, but a really impressive mixtape has a theme and conveys a message.

In addition, wear gloves to protect your skin. It's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best. Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected. Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children!   Listen up, kids: You'll be working with a solution that's near a 12 on the pH scale. That basically means don't swallow it, don't put it in your eyes, don't bathe in it, and don't really expose yourself to it directly at all. Got it? Moving on.  A ceramic bowl will work best, but plastic works too. Use funnels, measuring tubes, and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you.   Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol's nitrogen atoms with oxygen. When that happens, all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results? The glow.  It is important not to touch the luminol. Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy. Unfortunately, these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests.   Yep, unless you're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy/criminologist you probably don't have this stuff lying around the house (hopefully not...). If you're dead set on starting your own glowstick business (worse ideas exist), try websites like Alfa Aesaror Sigma Aldrichfor supplies. Mix everything well. Don't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort.  It's important to use sanitary, clean tubes for your glowsticks. The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you're depending on to make the substances glow.  This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling. It's not like the glow will get up and run away from you, but still.  Shake them up once the lids are on tightly. Then turn off the lights!   If it's not already glowing, something went wrong. Do over!  , Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them! But act quickly...the glow won't last very long. Expectations crushed? Method two to the rescue!   The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates doesn't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes. For something that lasts hours, go to the next method (which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory, but it's still worth mentioning).	Put on protective glasses. Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl. Mix .2 grams of luminol, 4 grams of sodium carbonate, .4 grams of copper sulfate, .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of distilled water in a second bowl. Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly. Set the correct lid next to each container. Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles. Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow.
You will need to prove that you achieved this level of education when you apply to work at the Federal Aviation Administration. Submitting proof of a higher level education can be substituted.; , The 2 most common routes are to become a pilot or an airplane mechanic.   Obtain your pilot's license. Most people gain a private pilot's license by passing a theory and practical test. Then, they log at least 250 flying hours so that they can begin training for their commercial license. Attending a flying school is a popular way to get experience with commercial aircraft. Pass the required practical FAA examination to become a licensed pilot. Pursue an airplane mechanic or engineering degree from an aviation maintenance school. These are usually located at technical colleges. You will be required to pass a 3-part FAA examination, including a written, oral and practical test.  FAA inspectors usually have at least 5 years of industry experience, although it will depend upon the position you would like to hold.   Pilots must have 1,500 flight hours with commercial craft. They must also have at least 100 flight hours in the last 3 years, and have at least 1 year of experience flying aircraft that is over 12,500 lbs. They must be able to prove a healthy medical inspection and no more than 2 flying errors in the past 5 years. Avionics applicants apply to inspect repair facilities and training programs. They must be able to show that they have avionics experience on aircraft over 12,500 lbs. They must also have experience in avionics maintenance and/or repair within the last 3 years. Maintenance inspectors must have experience repairing and maintaining aircraft that is over 12,500 lbs. They must have some experience in the industry in the last 3 years, and they must carry an FAA maintenance license.  The FAA looks for people who are capable of leadership and management.  The FAA looks for people who possess the following skills: public speaking, writing, interpersonal, risk management, ethics, organization and decision-making. If you require improvement in 1 of these areas, consider taking classes or joining a professional organization to get training.  FAA hiring differs from year to year, based on the number of openings there are nationally. Some years can be highly competitive, so you may need to apply more than once.   There are several different positions for FAA safety inspectors. If you are applying to evaluate pilots, you will want to apply for an operation safety inspector position with air carriers or general aviation. If you have history in avionics, you will apply for an avionics safety inspector position. If you have a maintenance license, you will apply for a mechanical safety inspector position.  FAA safety inspectors can not have an addiction that could affect their performance.  FAA safety inspectors may be required to undergo a medical exam, or show proof of a recent medical evaluation.	Complete your high school education. Gain experience in the aviation field. Gain the required experience working in aviation. Gain at least 1 year of experience in a supervisory position. Develop your professional skills. Search for inspector positions at FAA. Pass a drug test. Pass a medical exam.
Before beginning any installation, shut off the water source leading to your toilet or the toilet will flood the bathroom.   The valve is usually located on the pipes running into your toilet from the wall. Shut off the water by turning the valve clockwise until you feel resistance.; , Flushing the toilet will drain most of the remaining water from the toilet, allowing you to access the its internal parts more easily.   This will also prevent any remaining water from spilling out of the toilet and all over the floor. Soak up any remaining water with a sponge and bucket.  Next, look at the bottom of the toilet and find the one hose attached to it, the supply hose, and remove it. Then, remove the nuts and bolts from the hose with your adjustable wrench, and lift up the tank.   Lift up the tank carefully, and it will come off the bottom portion of the toilet. Turn the tank upside down, resting it on the toilet seat.  Locate the thick, conical rubber gasket and remove it. Underneath the gasket you’ll see a large plastic nut. Loosen and remove the plastic nut to remove the flush valve.   Start to loosen the nut by turning it counterclockwise with your pliers. The flush valve will come right off. Undo the clip (looks like a paper clip) attaching the hose by pushing it off. This clip connects the flush valve to the filler valve.  Use 409 or a similar cleaning product and Clorox with bleach to clean the surfaces that touch the flush valve.   This will prevent any debris or residue from interfering with the flush valve's seal, ensuring that you do not get leaks. Use a rag and cleaning product.  The new valve will go in the same way the old valve came out. Push the new valve through the bottom of the tank. Take the valve with the threaded side up and slowly direct it through the hole so your hand is in the tank. Be careful not to attach it too tightly, or it might cause the tank to crack.Make sure the black tube, extending from the top of the new valve, is one inch below the toilet lever or handle on the left side of the toilet tank. Cut the tube to the correct height, before putting the hose back on. The manufacturer's instructions will specify what that height is. For example, with a Fluidmaster 507A/B/D flush valve, you'll want to cut the overflow pipe so it's at least one inch below the hole in the tank where the flush lever is mounted., Once the flush valve is in the hole, attach a new thick rubber gasket (the same type as you removed). Then, hold the valve steady and replace the attaching nut, screwing it tight with your hands.  Replace the hose, attaching it to the black plastic tube extending from the top of the flush valve.  Turn the toilet tank right side up, and put it back on the toilet carefully, in order to avoid damaging any of your recently installed parts.   Put the old nuts back on to make the tank sits snug on the toilet. If you have purchased a toilet kit, use the new screws it includes. , The supply hose located on the bottom of the toilet tank should be reattached to the toilet at this point, to restore water flow. It has a plastic nut on the end with threads.   Connect it to the filler valve (looks like a little white tube) by threading the nut and bolt by hand. Then, use a wrench to tighten the nut a quarter of a turn. Do not overtighten.  Flush the toilet a few times to check for potential leaks that may have developed. If the toilet has a leak, it will leak immediately.   Get under the toilet with a flashlight and see if the toilet is dripping. Identify where the leak is coming from. Generally, water could be coming from the supply line or from a leaky gasket. Shut off the water to check over the conical gasket and the supply line attachment. Inspect and tighten the connections to address leaks.  The water level should usually line up with the water mark on the inside of the toilet bowl. If water does not rise to the right level in the toilet, adjust the filler valve.   You can adjust the filler valve dramatically by moving the entire valve up or down. For minor adjustments, use the filler valve's screw.  If you hear a whistle or noise that sounds like air leaving a balloon, then the flapper valve is not closing. Make an adjustment to slightly raise or lower the valve. The screw for the flapper valve is usually found on the float that looks like a little barrel that moves up and down with the water level.   Use a screwdriver to adjust the flapper valve's screw, tightening or loosening until the noise ceases.	Shut off the water to the toilet. Remove any remaining water from the toilet. Remove the tank. Locate and remove the flush valve. Clean the area on both sides of the flush valve. Install the new valve. Attach a new rubber gasket. Replace the hose attached to the flush valve. Put the toilet tank back on the toilet. Connect the flapper chain.  , Reattach the supply hose. Make sure the toilet is not leaky. Check to make sure that the water rises to the water mark. Listen for a whistling noise or self-flushing sound.
Feeding the deer encourages them to see your yard as a food resource and won't endear you to your neighbors. It also brings them in close range with where vehicles are and risks collisions when deer hang around the roadside and cross roads.	Don't feed deer.
Adding a waistcoat to your look says you’re the captain of the pirates! Choose one with brass buttons or detailing. You can often find these in vintage stores or costume shops. If not, look online.; , Your shirt should be baggy, so pick one a few sizes larger than you normally would. Choose white or beige, in any fabric. You can choose a blouse or a shirt with ruffles, or a common dress shirt. Tuck it into your pants, let the collar lie flat, and leave the cuffs unbuttoned.You can also add a sash or scarf in a bright or contrasting color to your waist.  Long, loose trousers are ideal, but any pair of black pants will do, as long as they aren’t denim. You will want to tuck the pants into your boots to achieve true pirate style.You can also cut off the bottoms of your pants for a ragged look. Women can opt for pants or for a long, flowing, poofy skirt., Choose a red, navy, or black vest to wear over your shirt. A fabric like velvet is perfect for pirates. You can choose to leave the buttons undone or to button the vest.For women, add a corset or bodice over your shirt., Pick a pair of boots that are tall and slip on, rather than lace up. Choose black or brown. True Buccaneer boots go to the mid-calf and have a large fold-over flap.   For women, choose boots or shoes with buckles.Pirates often go barefoot as well, so that is also an option.  No pirate is complete without their hat! Opt for the tricorne (three-point) style. Choose a simple black hat, or go all out with feather details.You can tie a scarf around your head under your hat as well. Alternatively, wear a bandana.  Choose a black eye patch, or one decorated with the jolly roger. Keep in mind that wearing an eye patch will weaken your eye, so if you want to wear one, switch it from eye to eye every day.  Many pirates have lost limbs in ferocious sea battles! “Replace” your hand with a fake hook, or your leg with a wooden peg leg for an authentic pirate look.  To sound like a pirate, add a bit of rasp to your voice. A parched, gravelly voice is what you should aim for, since pirates often yell at their shipmates and are at sea for long stretches, where clean drinking water can be scarce. Argh!  , Pirates are often drunk and are never concerned with pronunciation. Run your words together, such as “lookit’tha lass” rather than “look at the lass.” Mutter under your breath, saying words like “scallywags” and “lily-livered.”  , Add some nautical terms to your vocabulary, such as “land ahoy,” “on the starboard side.” Pirates also like to say “keep to the code.” You should use words like booty, pillage, buried treasure, matey, plank, buccaneer, landlubber, plunder, lass, scurvy, grog, and savvy.   Do an online search or use an app to learn even more pirate words.  Use a more casual style, and change “being” to “bein,” “sailing” to “sailin,” “over” to “o’er,” and “never” to “ne’er.”, Instead of “we are sailing,” say “we be sailin’.” Another example is “we be swashbucklin’!”, Examples include “what ye be doin’ boy?” “yar gonna miss the ship,” and “ye better be ready to walk the plank!”, Instead of saying “my parrot” say “me parrot.” Or, tell someone to “take your hands off me booty” rather than “take your hands off my booty.” Another example is “make sail, me hearty!”, Pirates like to exaggerate, so add extra adjectives to your descriptions. Instead of saying “a big ship,” say “a great, grand ship!” Talk about the “no good, lily-livered sailors” rather than the “bad sailors.”, Pirates aren’t happy, peppy people. They look and sound mean and nasty, so get a bit cranky to act like a true pirate., Gesture with your hand when talking and occasionally slam your hands on a table or other surface. Pirates are very emotional, so ramp up your attitude a couple notches.  A real or fake parrot will do! Perch it on your shoulder and feed it bits of cracker. A parrot that “talks” is your best bet.  Choose fake weapons so you don’t get into any trouble! Pirates carry a cutlass (sword) and also sometimes a flintlock pistol., Add one or two hoops to your ears if they are pierced. You can also choose earrings with wooden beads., A proper pirate needs a telescope for spotting ships that can be plundered. You can make one out of a cardboard tube., Add a pirate-like swagger in your step. Be confident and a bit sassy too.  Round up some friends and turn them into pirates too. If possible, get a ship (maybe a raft), sail together, make maps, and even bury treasure!  , If you’re of legal drinking age, make rum your drink of choice. Choose a dark, spiced variety rather than the clear liquor.	Wear a waistcoat. Choose an oversized shirt. Wear black pants. Add a vest. Choose tall boots. Wear a hat. Add an eye patch. Get a hook or a peg leg. Use a low, gravelly voice. Mutter or slur your words. Learn the lingo. Drop your gs and vs. Pirates aren’t worried about pronouncing their words correctly. Use “be” instead of “am/are.” Pirates be bad with grammar!, Avoid saying “you” and “you’re.” Pirates say “ye” rather than “you,” and “yar” rather than “you are” or “you’re.” Switching out these simple words will have you sounding like a pirate in no time. Use “me” instead of first-person possessives. Double up on your adjectives. Growl and scowl. Gesture a lot. Get a parrot. Carry weapons. Wear hoop earrings. Get a telescope. Walk like a pirate. Assemble a pirate crew!, Drink rum.
You will need sturdy paper, wooden skewers, clear tape, scissors, and a writing utensil.If you'd like to customize your umbrellas by decorating the paper, you will also need some type of media to decorate with. Rubber stamps and non-toxic ink are a great choice.   Paper of medium thickness, such as construction paper, works best. However, thinner paper like printer or origami paper or thicker paper like cardstock can also work. Tissue paper, however, is much too thin. Decorative patterned paper and stationary will look great. These little umbrellas are great for decorating drinks.  If you'd like, decorate one side of the paper using pens, stamps, or some other media. Matching the decorations to the theme is great if you're making these for a party. If you have a printer that can print on thick paper, try printing out patterns. If you will be using these umbrellas to decorate anything edible, avoid using materials like glitter that may fall off into your food and drink.  Using a coaster or the bottom of a glass tumbler as a guide, trace non-overlapping circles onto the undecorated side of your paper. Cut out each circle using your scissors., Fold the circle in half and then unfold it. Make sure the decorated side of your paper is facing out. Fold it in half again to create a crease that is perpendicular but folded in the same direction as the first. Create a third crease in the same manner, this time with a diagonal through the first two creases. Do this for a total of eight creases creating 16 equal slices within the circle.Repeat this folding pattern for each umbrella.  Using your scissors, cut out a small almond shape from the edge of each of the 16 wedges. This will mimic the folded panels of a real umbrella. Do this for each of your paper circles., Select one crease and cut half of it, making a slit from the edge to the center. This step is necessary to create an umbrella that holds its shape. Repeat this for each umbrella., At the site of the slit, take the section on the left and bring it underneath so that the panel to the right overlaps it. Lay a small piece of tape flat down the underside of the umbrella to hold the two sides together together. Repeat this step for each umbrella., If you have trouble getting it through, use a toothpick or pen to make a tiny hole first. Don't make it too big or the umbrella will slide too far down its handle.   If you don't have wooden skewers, you can use plastic ones or long toothpicks instead. Either one will be easier to poke through the paper.Stick the bottom of the umbrella handle into drinks or food to create a festive atmosphere.	Gather your materials. Decorate the paper. Trace out one circle for each umbrella you plan on making. Fold your umbrellas. Scallop the edges. Cut down the center of one crease. Fold one panel under the other. Stick a wooden skewer through each umbrella.
High temperatures can cause your gasket to blow, and once this has occurred, your engine temperature will only continue to rise. If your car is constantly overheating, this could be a sign that your head gasket has blown.; , If your head gasket is blown, coolant may be leaking from the cooling system.  Check the colour of your oil. If it’s white and milky looking, or if your oil dipstick reveals a frothy substance, chances are your oil has mixed with the coolant and your head gasket has blown.  If you spot white smoke emerging from your exhaust pipe, this could mean that the coolant has leaked into the combustion chamber. ,, Once the compressor is free, lay the device on its side in order to access the cylinder head. , You won’t need to take off the entire alternator harness; simply remove the bolts.  Disconnect all the lines running to the air conditioner.  Refer to your service manual and pay close attention to the tightening sequence for the head bolts that hold the head gasket in place, as these must be loosened in the correct reverse order.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the cylinder head, so that the new head gasket sits correctly.   You’ll need a torque wrench to do so, as the bolts must be torqued to a specific tightness, relevant to your particular vehicle. It’s crucial that these bolts are torqued correctly, as otherwise you may cause damage to your new head gasket.  Reconnect the hoses in the order in which you disconnected them, replace the alternator, and ensure that all necessary parts are once again in place.  Allow the engine to run for several minutes before switching it off and checking your new head gasket for any leaks.	Look for a high engine temperature. Check for lower coolant levels. Look out for milky or frothy oil. Beware of light smoke emerging from the exhaust pipe. Disconnect the negative battery terminal, located at the top of the car battery.  , Remove the intake hose and airbox.  , Take off the air conditioner compressor; this will require you to remove several bolts. Disconnect the water pump hose, by using a screwdriver to loosen the clamp.  , Remove the alternator. Drain the radiator and remove the radiator hoses. The head gasket should now be visible. Remove the old blown head gasket. Once you have fitted the new head gasket into the space, tighten the bolts again in the correct order. Replace the components. Fill the cooling system with fresh coolant and turn on the engine, allowing it to idle until it reaches operating temperature.
You can purchase cloth or linen napkins at any local home goods store, as well as any large stores like Target or Walmart. If you really want your embroidery to stand out, make sure to choose napkins that don’t have any other designs or patterns. You can embroider any color napkins, but make sure to consider the color of thread you’ll be using. By using light-colored napkins with dark threads and vice versa, you can ensure that your embroidery is clearly visible., When it comes to embroidery, this step is crucial. If you’re a beginner, it can be a daunting task to sort through the colors, let alone types, of thread that a craft store offers. For napkins, the common, cotton embroidery floss will work perfectly. It can be helpful to hold the embroidery floss against the napkins you will be embroidering to determine which colors you need. Grab some embroidery needles, and you’re all set.If you have difficulty threading the embroidery floss through the small eye of the needle, consider purchasing a needle threader as well. This is a handy contraption that can make this task much easier.  An embroidery hoop is an invaluable tool when it comes to embroidering napkins. It is a simple hoop that will clamp down on the napkin to hold it flat and taut, ensuring your embroidery is even and smooth.These hoops come in different sizes depending on the size of the fabric and design that you’re working with. Make sure to purchase a hoop that can fit your design and can also fit into the size of the napkin.  When you’re deciding what to embroider onto your napkin, look for inspiration. If you are embroidering napkins to give as gifts, consider embroidering them with the recipient’s name or initials. If you’re embroidering napkins for a holiday party, consider holiday-themed designs. Check out the Internet, magazines, and patterns at the craft store to get an idea.When you’re choosing a design, keep your skill level in mind. An experienced embroiderer may be able to create an intricate Thanksgiving turkey, but a beginner may want to stick to initials.  Before you start stitching away on your fabric, it’s important to perfect the design. You can handwrite the text or draw the design on paper, and you can also use the computer. You can find simple patterns online by doing a Google search, or you can use interesting fonts to create the text. Make sure to print it out the same size that you want the design. You will be transferring this exact design to the fabric, so make sure you get it exactly how you want it!, Once you’re satisfied with the design you’ve created on paper, it’s time to transfer it to the napkin. This is where your transfer paper comes in. Place the carbon transfer on top of the napkin, and then place your design on top of it. Using a pen, pencil, or any pointed object, trace over the design on the regular paper.As you trace the design on your paper, you will be pressing the design into the transfer paper, which will in turn transfer your design to the napkin. It’s important that the paper and transfer paper do not shift during this step. If you need to, tape the paper and transfer paper to the napkins so they don’t budge.  This is easiest to do after you’ve transferred your design to the napkin. Different hoops have different ways of holding the napkin, but all that matters is that there are no ripples in the fabric. The cloth should be held taut, with the design inside the hoop. Consider your hoop to be your easel – it holds your canvas up so that you can create your masterpiece.If you don’t have an embroidery hoop or simply don’t want to use one, you can embroider your design without it. Just take extra care to make sure that you hold your napkin evenly and tightly so that there are no bulges or ripples in the finished embroidery.  Finally, you’re ready for the fun part. Grab your embroidery floss, and pull the end through the eye of the needle. This is where the needle threader may come in handy, if you have one. Otherwise, use a steady hand to slip the floss through the small opening in the needle. Pull a couple inches of thread through, so that it won’t easily slip back out as you’re working.   The thread should be long enough to trace your design, but not too long that it will get tangled and in your way. Tie a knot at the end of your thread. This will be the “stopper” that keeps your thread from sliding all the way through the cloth.  To start, poke your needle through the backside of the napkin. The needle should emerge at the very beginning of your design. Pull your thread all the way through the fabric. Keep pulling until you feel the knot against the fabric, stopping your thread.   It’s important to pull your thread all the way through the fabric with each stitch so that you don’t accidentally create any knots.  About half a centimeter from where your needle came through, poke it back through the fabric the opposite way. This will create your first stitch. Again, make sure to pull your thread completely through the fabric.  After you’ve pulled your thread through and have created your first stitch, you’ll begin the process of backstitching. Poke your needle back through the fabric from the backside, one stitch length away from the first one. Pull the thread through. Then, poke your needle at the same point that the first stitch ended, and pull your thread through.In other words, you are creating a stitch backwards to connect it to the first stitch – hence the name backstitch! Continue poking the needle up through the napkin one stitch length away, connecting it to the prior stitch, and so on until you’ve filled in your entire traced design.  After you’ve completed embroidering your design, you need to tie off the end of your thread. Keep your needle threaded to make this process a bit easier. Tie the end of the thread around some of the stitching on the backside of the napkin. Then, run your needle through some of these stitches to camouflage the loose tail of the thread. Use your embroidery scissors to trim any excess thread.	Choose your napkins. Select your needle and thread. Get an embroider hoop. Choose your design. Draw or print your design on paper. Trace the design onto the napkin with transfer paper. Place your napkin in your embroidery hoop. Thread your needle. Begin embroidering your design. Take your needle back through the fabric. Continue backstitching the rest of your traced design. Knot off the end of your embroidery.
There are a lot of nobody bands out there and anyone can hire one to play a few Katy Perry covers at their baby shower for four bucks an hour. If you want your band to be sought out for gigs, you need to be worthy of that.; , Sorry, but wait till the record deal to play your own songs.  For example, you can use an electric guitar to play Taylor Swift songs, you can go on YouTube and search for Mash Ups or Remixes for your popular songs, or you can use the power of harmony to make Beyonce's Halo something angels cry about.  Good dancing can make anyone book you for a gig. Another way you can put a twist on popular songs is by playing pop songs with a piano, use DJ equipment to put special effects on your songs, or mash the song up with a song with a similar beat.

Most beads will work when covered, as long as they're not rough or precious. Choose the beads in sizes that are easy to cover; in other words, not too small and it's probably a good idea to avoid beads with odd shapes, as they may be harder to define after being wrapped in fabric.   You may want to vary bead sizes, depending on the design for your handmade jewelry.; , This might be all the same fabric or a combination of fabrics––decide this by sorting out your design beforehand, then selecting the fabric accordingly.   Do you want the beads to match an outfit? In which case, select fabric that complements that particular outfit. Avoid using distinctive patterns, loud colors or vibrant designs if you want the beads to go with a range of outfits. On the other hand, if you like an eclectic look, this may not be a problem.  Measure the width of the bead. Use this measurement to make a fabric template that is slightly wider than each side of the bead and several lengths longer than the bead, each side. (The pieces need to be long enough to wrap around the bead.)   If using different sizes of beads, you'll need to make different templates for each size. Make a mark on the templates to make it easy to remember which template matches which beads.  Repeat making strips for as many beads to be covered.  Spread glue over the fabric strip.  Roll the bead along, wrapping it with the fabric as you go. Smooth down wrinkles as you go, to prevent them from forming permanently.   If you need to keep the bead holes clear, stick a toothpick into the bead to help you avoid wrapping over the holes; when the toothpick is in the hole, it's easy to roll the fabric around the hole.  This time, glue it to the bead in the same way, only align it slightly diagonally, so that it covers any uncovered part of the bead. Repeat with another glue-covered strip, aligning it again to ensure coverage. By now, the bead should be covered fully but if not, add another layer. ,	Select the beads. Select the fabric to cover the beads according to your needs. Prepare the fabric. Cut the fabric into an even strip following the fabric template you've just made. Lay a strip of fabric down, with the non-printed/wrong side facing upward. Place a bead at one end of the glue-covered fabric strip. Repeat with another strip of glue-covered strip of fabric. Allow each bead to dry completely before using in jewelry making or craft projects.  , Repeat with as many beads as you need for your project.
Some of the faults of a sailboat can look awful but are easy to repair while other faults are hidden and expensive. For a beginner, it's really hard to spot the difference. Hire a professional surveyor. You'll need a survey done for insurance purposes anyway. It will be money well-spent, especially if the boat is an expensive one.; , If you go looking at boats without a clear idea of what kind of boat you want to sail, you may fall in love with a boat that won't meet your needs. Think: Do you want to race? Then, buy the kind of boat people in your area are racing. Do you want to trailer it to distant cruising grounds? Then, restrict your search to smaller boats with trailers. Do you want performance or a big fat cabin? If you don't know the answers, you risk wasting your money.  Learning to sail involves lots and lots of sailing. Fixing up a junker boat can take months or years and won't teach you a thing about sailing.  There is all sorts of obscure knowledge about racing boats that you will be helpless without.	Take an expert with you. Figure out what kind of boat you want to own before you go shopping. If you are new to sailing, look for a boat that is basically ready to sail away. If you are interested in racing a sailboat, always hook up with local sailboat racers before you buy a boat.
There are many different types of harmonica available for purchase, which vary in use and price. For now, purchase either a diatonic or a chromatic harmonica. Either type can be used to play most popular music, such as blues or folk.          The diatonic harmonica is arguably the most common type available, and certainly the cheapest. It's tuned to a specific key, which can't be changed. Most diatonic harmonicas are tuned to the key of C. Types of diatonic harmonica include the “blues harmonica,” the “tremolo harmonica,” and the “octave harmonica.”  In the western world, the blues harmonica is common; in east Asia, the tremolo harmonica is seen more often.   The chromatic harmonica is a type of harmonica that uses a mechanical apparatus to control which holes make noise. Basic chromatic harmonicas with 10 notes can only play one full key (the same as a diatonic harmonica), but chromatics with 12-16 holes can be tuned to any key. Chromatics are considerably more expensive than most diatonic harmonicas; a quality chromatic from a reputable brand can cost several hundred dollars.  Because of their flexibility, 12-plus-note chromatic harmonicas are generally preferred for jazz music.   A common shorthand term for the harmonica is the “harp.” This comes from its other traditional names, including “French harp” and “blues harp.” As long as the context is clear, the words “harmonica” and “harp” can be used interchangeably.; , The harmonica is a reed instrument that uses brass reeds. The reeds are what split the air you push or pull through the holes to create tones. Reeds are mounted on a plate, sensibly called the reed plate, which is also usually made of brass. The part of the harmonica that the reed plate is mounted to is called the comb, and is typically made of plastic or metal. The mouthpiece of the harp may be integrated into the comb, or in chromatic harmonicas, screwed on separately. The cover plates cover the rest of the apparatus, and can be made of wood, metal, or plastic.          A chromatic harp's sliding bar is also usually made of metal. Depending on whether you inhale or exhale through your harp, different notes are produced by the reeds. A typical diatonic harp tuned to C on the exhale is tuned to G on the inhale. These scales complement each other nicely, each filling in the other without having to add extra holes. The reeds inside your harmonica are delicate and will wear out over time. Gentle playing and regular care are required to maintain a good tone as long as possible.  Like guitars, harmonicas can be played by following tablature, which reduces the notes on a sheet of music down to an easy-to-follow system of holes and breath patterns. Tablature is useful for larger chromatic harmonicas as well, but it differs somewhat from diatonic tablature, and is less common.          Breathing is marked by arrows. An up arrow indicates a breath out; a down arrow indicates a breath in.  Most holes on a diatonic harmonica produce two “neighbor” notes on a given scale; thus playing C and then D on the same scale is accomplished by blowing into the appropriate hole, and then drawing in from the same hole.   Holes are marked with a number, starting from the lowest (left-hand) tone and moving upward. Thus, the lowest two notes are (up) 1 and (down) 1. On a 10-hole harp, the highest note would be (down) 10.  Some notes on a regular 10-hole harmonica overlap, notably (down) 2 and (up) 3. This is necessary to allow proper range for playing scales.   More advanced techniques are marked with slashes or another small mark. Diagonal slashes through the arrows indicate that note bending (covered later) is required to get the proper tone. Chevrons or slashes on chromatic tablature can also indicate whether or not to hold the button in.  There isn't a standardized system of tablature that's used by all harmonica players. However, once you practice and get comfortable reading one type, most other types will make sense to you quickly.	Choose a harmonica. Learn about your harmonica. Learn to read harmonica tablature.
Plant Mimosa pudica seeds indoors in spring, at any time before the last frost.If you have growing lights and good temperature control, you may plant them indoors at any time of year., Take off the brown outer covering. Then you will have a greenish seed.  Gently expose a small bit of the white flesh inside. Tweezers have worked well for this part, though it may be hard.  Mimosa pudica can grow in most well-drained soil, even if low in nutrients.For best results, however, try a mix of loam and dry, aerating materials, such as two parts loam, two parts peat moss, and one part sand or perlite.If you don't want to make your own mix, most all-purpose commercial potting mixes have similar ratios, and should work well enough.  The seeds are more likely to germinate if you weaken the tough outer seed coat first. Soak the seeds in bowl of hot water for 30 minutes — or up to 24 hours if you want to play it safe.(You may let the water cool as the seeds soak.)  , Place each seed just barely below the surface of the soil, about 3mm (⅛ in.) down.It's likely that most of your seeds won't germinate, so these extra seeds will minimize wasted effort.   You can start the seeds in a seed tray or in 7 cm (3 in.) pots., Water until the soil is slightly moist, but not soggy. Water again whenever the soil is about to dry out.If you're worried about getting the right amount of water, place the flowerpot in a shallow dish of water. Let sit ten minutes or until the top of the soil feels damp, then discard the excess water., If sensitive plants do not get enough sun, they may close their leaves. Put them in a location where they receive full sun for most of the day, or partial shade if you live in a very hot region.In ideal conditions with temperatures around 70ºF (21ºC), the seeds may germinate in under a week. In less ideal conditions, or if you didn't soak the seeds, this may take two to four weeks.Some of your seeds may survive colder nighttime temperatures, but they may end up slow-growing or fragile. Never expose the seeds to frost. If the room is too cool or too dry, cover the pot with plastic wrap to trap heat and moisture. Remove this as soon as the first seedling appears., If more than one seedling sprouts in the same pot, move the smallest ones to another pot once they are a few centimeters (1–2 inches) high. Once your plant reaches maturity, transplant it to a larger pot whenever the roots come out the drainage hole or press against the sides of the container.  The soil should remain moist at all times, but never soggy.If the sensitive plant is in a dry room, mist it with room temperature occasionally, or place it on a humidity tray., Sensitive plants are an invasive weed in many areas. Unless you are in one of their native habitats in tropical America, you may want to grow sensitive plants indoors. Gardeners worldwide report the plant taking over their lawns.In Australia, you are legally required to minimize the spread of mimosa pudica seeds off your property., Dilute a balanced fertilizer to half the strength recommended on the label. Apply to the soil once a week during the growing season, and once a month during winter.Avoid direct contact with the roots.  Since it is a tropical plant, Mimosa pudica will grow best if nighttime temperatures are 70ºF (21ºC) or higher.If temperatures fall below 65ºF (18ºC), move the plant to a warmer room or keep the plant warm in other ways.Adult plants can survive temperatures as low as 40ºF (4.5 °C), but are at risk of damage or death. Keep an eye out for yellow leaves and stems, which are signs of possible cold damage., It's normal for the stem to fall over and creep along the ground once the plant matures.Provide a trellis or sturdy plant to support it, or allow enough horizontal space for it to grow. Some sensitive plants grow more than 1 meter (3 ft) high or 2 meters (6.6 ft) horizontally, but in temperate zones they will more likely reach half this size., Mimosa pudica can survive for at least two years in tropical climates, but are usually annual plants in temperate zones.Even if your plant survives after its first bloom (usually in summer), you may have better results letting it die and collecting its seeds for next spring.   To collect seeds, let the pods dry on the plant, then break them open and collect the seeds.	Choose a planting time. Purchase some seeds from a reputable grower. Prepare your potting mix. Soak the seeds (optional). Plant two or three seeds in each small flower pot. Water the soil. Provide plenty of sunlight. Transplant to other pots when necessary. Keep the soil moist. Keep the plant indoors (recommended). Fertilize regularly. Protect against cold. Provide space for the plant to grow. Watch its lifespan.
Cut two circles from your felt. Each circle should be about two inches. You may also trace an old spool of ribbon to help you create a smooth circle. Then cut around five feet of ribbon. Be sure to use ribbon with wire in its construction. Use thicker ribbon for a greater blooming effect. Be sure to pull a bit of the wire out of the ribbon and fold it over so that it doesn’t pull through the ribbon when you gather it.Choose felt that complements the colour and pattern of your ribbon. You can buy both at your arts and crafts store or dollar store. The length of the ribbon depends on how large you want to make your flower. For a very large flower use about two arms' lengths worth of ribbon. For a smaller flower, use about half an arm's length of ribbon.  Pull the bottom wire from the other side of the ribbon. You should be pulling on the same side that you kinked the wire. Gather the whole ribbon by pulling the wire in one direction and the ribbon in the other.Push as you gather the ribbon to push the gathered bunch of ribbon along the wire.  Fold the raw edge of the ribbon down and glue it onto the felt. On the outside of the circle, glue the ribbon so that it covers the edge of the entire circle. Don’t put too much glue. Glue about an inch at a time.To add extra ruffle, gather more ribbon as you glue. You can also pull out more wire if the ribbon is gathered too tightly. This is entirely personal preference.  Continue gluing to create a spiral pattern around your circle. Cut off about two inches of ribbon once you reach the center of the flower. This will create the center of the flower., Place the raw edge of the ribbon down and squish the ribbon. The wire in the ribbon keeps the ribbon in place so fuss all you want until you get the look you like. Once you’re happy, lift up the petals and dab some glue at your desired points to set your look., Glue the ends of the ribbon to keep it sealed. If you are using the flower as part of a bouquet or on a headband, you can also glue the ribbon down onto the stem or headband.	Cut your ribbon and felt. Pull the bottom wire and gather the ribbon. Glue the ribbon down. Create a spiral pattern. Fold the ribbon into place. Seal the ribbon.
Whether you are just getting started or working on your 100th sweater, medium worsted weight yarn is a safe bet.You can find this kind of yarn in almost any color and it comes in a variety of materials, such as acrylic, wool, alpaca, cashmere, and bamboo.To figure out if a yarn is medium worsted weight, check the label on the yarn. It should describe the weight with a term like medium, bulky, or super bulky.; , If you want to finish a project faster, or you just like the bulky look, then opt for a bulky or extra bulky yarn. These yarns are popular as well, so you will have lots of different colors to choose from. Most often, bulky yarns are acrylic, but you may be able to find them in other materials if you go to a craft or specialty yarn store., Cotton yarn does not give the way that other types of yarn do, so it is not usually a good type of yarn for hats and other garments that need some stretch to them.However, cotton yarn is excellent for making washcloths and hand towels. If you feel like making a washcloth, try picking up a ball of cotton yarn., There are some really fun specialty yarns available, so try one out the next time you are feeling adventurous. You can find yarn that is made from t-shirt material, woven with metallic ribbon, or that looks fluffy like feathers or fur., Metallic and plastic needles are the cheapest and most widely available, so these are great for knitting on a budget or building up your supply of different size needles. You can even find sets of three or more pairs of metallic needles if you want to buy in bulk.  Metallic needles can make it easier to knit faster, but plastic needles are lighter in weight.Try starting with a standard size 8 needle. This is a common size for patterns that use medium worsted weight yarn.  Bamboo and wood needles are incredibly popular among knitters.They are often easier to grip and some knitters prefer the texture of wood or bamboo to plastic or metal. If you are new to knitting, or if you have never tried using bamboo or plastic needles, give them a try.  You can get bamboo needles in all sizes.  Circular needles are knitting needles with a length of nylon suspended between them. They are mainly use for knitting in the round, such as making sweaters or hats. However, some people also like to knit on circular needles when doing a big project like a blanket because it is easier to fit all the stitches.You can also use double ended needles for small scale knitting in the round, such as for making mittens or a hat for a baby.  You can find tons of free knitting patterns online, or you can purchase knitting pattern books for everything from washcloths to hats to lap blankets. Browse through some patterns online or in a pattern book to find a project that you want to make.  A pattern is also a helpful guide for the supplies you will need to complete a project. Always check you pattern and get the exact type of yarn, needles, and other supplies indicated for the project.  Sharp scissors are a must for knitting. You may only need to use them once for your project, or you may find yourself using them every 15 minutes if you have to switch your yarn out a lot. Keep a pair handy while you are working., Stitch markers are little plastic rings that go around your needles to mark the beginning of a stitch. They are especially useful for complex projects and for marking the start of your stitches when knitting in the round., Cabling intimidates many knitters when they are first starting out, but cabling is much easier than it looks. A cable hook is essential for cabling, so make sure to pick one up when you feel ready to try out this technique. They come in many different sizes., End protectors go on the ends of your knitting needles to keep the yarn from sliding off when you are working or taking a break. These are especially useful when you are knitting on double ended needles, but you can place them on the ends of any type of needle when you are ready to put it away for the day., You can buy large eye plastic tapestry needles in craft stores to help with finishing your knitting projects. These are essential for weaving in the ends of your knitting project and adding embellishments like pompoms on hats., You will need someplace nice to keep all of your supplies, so pick up a knitting bag for yourself. If you don’t want to purchase a bag, then you can also designate a canvas bag or tote as your knitting supply bag.	Go with a medium worsted weight yarn. Consider a bulky yarn. Try cotton yarn for washcloths. Experiment with a specialty yarn. Opt for some metallic or plastic needles. Use bamboo or wood needles if you are just starting out. Try out circular needles. Choose a pattern. Get a pair of sharp scissors. Buy some stitch markers. Try out cabling with a cable hook. Grab some end protectors. Keep a tapestry needle on hand. Buy yourself a nice knitting bag.
Metal wire can be found at a local craft store. You will find it in the jewelry making supply aisle. It’s usually sold in a gold or silver finish.  Each strip will be cut to be 2 ½ feet (76 cm) long. Make the cut using a pair of wire cutters. Set the wires off to the side.The wire cutters are sharp. Use caution.  String a bead onto your first wire. Bring it down to the center of the wire. Bend the wire around the bead until the ends meet. Twist the wire tightly, moving down from the bead about ¾ inch (19 mm). You will be left with two ends on either side of the twist., Add another bead to one of the ends of your wire. Bend and twist the wire around the bead like you did in the last step. You will have about ¾ inch (19 mm) of wire below the bead. Repeat this step on the remaining end of the wire., You now have three beads on the wire in a “t” shape. Secure the beads by twisting the remaining wire together below the “t”. Twist these two wires together about ¾ inch (19 mm)., Add three beads to each of the remaining wires. You will end up with 10 “t” shaped wires with three beads on each wire., Cross two branches over each other and twist them together at the base of the beads. Do this with each of the branches so that you have five pairings., Take one pairing of branches and cross another pairing over it. Begin twisting the pairings together. Add another pairing, and another, until you have added all of the pairings. Continue twisting the pairings together. This twisting is creating the “trunk” of the tree.Create a thick, wide trunk by twisting the bases of the branches on top of each other. Create a thin, swirling trunk by stretching the bases of the branches out as your twist them together.  When you near the bottom of the wires, twist the wires around each other to create a ball. This ball will help to stabilize the tree within its container., Add a liberal amount of glue to the bottom of the container using a hot glue gun. Push the ball of the tree into the hot glue. Hold onto the tree while the glue dries.The container can be a small planter or decorative bowl.  While the glue is still hot, add a layer of pebbles to the container. All of the pebbles should fit down into the glue. They should be surrounding the tree trunk. They will offer the tree more support once all of the glue is dry.Remember to continue to hold the tree while adding the pebbles. If you need to free your hands, prop the tree up with something to prevent it from falling over. Work quickly as your glue will dry within one to two minutes.  Add another layer of glue on top of the first layer of pebbles. Continue to add pebbles to the glue. Repeat this process several times until you have reached the top of the container., Once the glue has dried, you can adjust your tree branches. Bend the wire branches so that the tree takes your desired shape.Turn the branches down to resemble a weeping willow tree. Fray the branches out and slightly up to resemble a maple or oak tree.	Purchase 25 feet (7.6 m) of 22-gauge wire. Cut the wire into 10 strips. Add a bead to the first wire. Add two more beads to the wire. Secure the beads. Repeat this process with the remaining nine wires. Twist two branches together. Twist the grouped branches into a tree. Create a ball at the bottom of the tree. Place the tree into the desired container. Add one layer of pebbles to the container. Glue more pebbles inside of the container. Adjust the branches.
Ordinary vinegar makes a versatile cleaning solution that’s both safe and all-natural. Combine equal parts distilled white vinegar and warm water in a small spray bottle. Shake the bottle to make sure the two liquids are thoroughly blended.The heat from the water will be even more helpful for releasing dried stains from the surface of the shower. For even better results, add a few drops of mild liquid dishwashing detergent. The soap will emulsify dirt and oil while the vinegar brightens and disinfects., Mist the inside shower with the vinegar solution. Be sure to address spots with the worst buildup. This may include unexpected places like the shelving at the top of the shower or the area around the drain.Don’t forget to get inside cracks and crevices and along recessed panels and soap dishes. Pure vinegar makes the perfect antidote to mold and mildew growth., Vinegar is an effective natural solvent, but it requires a little time to work effectively. For most light or moderate messes, the vinegar should sit for at least half an hour. To remove heavier buildup, you may even want to let it remain for 1-2 hours to ensure success.If vinegar alone isn’t cutting it, sprinkle a little baking soda over the affected area before spraying it again. The foaming action produced by the two cleaners will eat away at stubborn gunk and grime.A mixture of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar can make a convenient substitute for baking soda and vinegar., Use a clean, dry washcloth, microfiber towel or sponge to erase any last traces of loose residue. Wipe with gentle circular motions and apply pressure where needed to break up tough stains. Afterwards, rinse the interior of the shower with hot water.Dig into hard-to-reach spots with your fingertips or the corner of a sponge.	Mix together vinegar and water. Treat problem areas with the vinegar solution. Leave the vinegar to break down stains. Scrub the acrylic with a soft cloth.
If you cannot get through even one book at a time, starting several at once is only going to make the whole process slower. Even if you can only spend a few minutes per day reading, you can still switch on and off between different books.   The books may be related or unrelated, depending on your purpose. If you are researching a particular subject, they will probably be related. If you are reading for fun, the books may be any assortment you wish. Choose books that draw you in. It will be easier to come back to a book you enjoy.  You can read the beginnings (one at a time), or you can pre-read. Look at the table of contents, and read or skim the summaries, introductions, and prefaces., Try to start the day you bring it home or the day you begin a project. Use your fresh interest to read a larger portion of a new book in the first sitting or sittings. Thoroughly engage with and commit to reading each book in turn. Reading more the first time will also give you a good head start.  You need not start several books at the same time to read them concurrently. Instead, try laddering them, getting well into the first before starting the next.  Leave one on your nightstand, one by the breakfast table, and another in your bag. Read whichever book is nearby when you are there. Match the book to the focus or mood you usually have when you visit a certain place.  Place one in your home bathroom in easy reach of the toilet, especially if it's nonfiction with a lot of short subtopics. You'll be surprised at how often you read in the bathroom. Don't put it where the shower will get it wet though and be careful if you read during soaking baths to have a towel handy to dry your hands while handling pages. You might want a short reading stand next to a bathtub.  Listen to an audio book in the car, keep a paperback or e-book in your purse, have e-books on your iPad, etc. Depending on your purpose, choose books of different subjects and difficulties, so that you'll have choices for different places and moods. Reading about different topics will help you keep straight which book is which.  Your mind can cope well with associating different books being read within the same time period but in different places. So, have books for the bus or train to and from work, books for bedtime, books for the hammock afternoon, and books for moments when you need instructions, such as cookbooks. Keep in mind that reading a politically charged tome at bedtime will be more effort than a lightweight genre read. Another good reason for having several books on the go at once! Good bedtime choices include rereading old favorites - when you know how it ends, it's easier to set it down when you finally drowse.  If no library or project due date is built into your reading choices, notice when you begin each book and pay attention to your progress. Use this awareness of time to keep yourself relatively focused., The books you read concurrently must compete for your attention. If a book interests you much less than others, change your approach. Read that book separately. Read that book alongside others of a similar interest level. Or, consider dropping the book altogether., Reading an entire section in a sitting will help you keep continuity when you skip from book to book. Reading one or two shorter sections of a book per sitting can also help you understand difficult or complex writing better., If you find yourself drawn into a book and feel like continuing for longer, go ahead. Read whichever book you are in the mood to read at a given moment., Let yourself read the fun book for awhile when you get through part of the difficult book.,, Endings in fiction are often the most intense part of the story. In nonfiction, they usually contain summaries, conclusions, and other important information. Either way, try to read with more continuity near the end., However many books you choose to read at a time, make sure to continue to read the important ones until you finish with them.	Make time to read.  Select several books according to your interests and your reasons for reading them. Sample each book. Start reading each book while your attention for it is fresh.  Scatter books around. Mix books of different types and formats. Have a time line in mind, even if it's not a firm or strict one. Don't ignore any book so long that you lose the story or forget where you were.  Read an entire chapter or section at a time whenever possible, or at least find a good stopping place. Let your focus and preferences guide you. Get through a difficult book by using a fun book as a reward.  Take notes on key points as you go, or mark pages you will need to find again for a project. , Try to read endings in longer sittings and spend less time in other books. Finish books.
Very old toilets may accumulate hard water deposits that narrow their passages and cause water to drain out only slowly.  If your toilet's flush seems more hesitant than your friends', try some muriatic (hydrochloric) acid or other calcium remover, adding a little water at a time to push it into the bend to attack the deposits.,  Run the vent, and flush the toilet before using.	Try an acidic cleaner. Remember that strong acids and their fumes can be dangerous and corrosive.
Meditation, particularly walking meditation, is excellent for this subject, but you can find other means such as observation and consideration in day-to-day activity. You can study the mind and mental themes, the body and body processes, or all of them together if you wish.   In some cases this is often referred to as mindfulness, which is probably the most in-depth and practical way to study this subject as it is essentially an awareness of things in the moment as they happen.; , For lack of better words we could separate them into "body functional" and "emotional/psychological" types for the purpose of exploring this topic.   For example, you may feel hungry and intend to find a meal which is aimed at meeting a bodily need, but the choice as to how to prepare the food is a more emotional or psychological one. Consider if you are (for example) hungry and you have a tomato - would you have it in a salad, in a pasta sauce, fried, or in a sandwich? (And so forth.) Once you have decided, you would need to prepare it and gather the right tools (this means there are new intentions behind your actions in gathering the tools) to be able to process the tomato into a meal. But the bodily function doesn't really care, as a tomato is food be it raw or cooked. There are also existing meditation practices devoted to these two types of intention, known as: body mindfulness and mental mindfulness, investigate or try those to see if they help you.  Intention runs consistently before action and this can be seen such as when you have no intention to do anything at all – you can easily just sit and vegetate until you feel the need to do something such as eat, go to the toilet/bathroom, or find something to do if boredom strikes.   Reaction is not really different as it still does have its own mental processes that still come before the response, they are just much faster due to the urgency. This is often because the mind acts separately without needing any intellectual analysis, preferences or commentary - such as if when a person senses something approaching their head, they typically blink, duck, or block with their hands (etc). This too is a body-functional intention as mental processes do not all run at the same speed - some are much faster than others, but the mind has to intend to blink, duck, or block (etc), as without the mind being aware and being able to knit the information together to make an instruction to the body how to react, a reaction wouldn't happen.  Perception shapes urgency, so if it perceives danger or pain, it adds greater importance and urgency to the action. Likewise, if perception informs you not to like something, such as feeling bored, or hungry, perception then influences intention to want to do something about the negative feeling.   Likewise consider other things that can affect intention, positively such as insight or negatively such as prejudice. Similarly how perception can receive a sensation (mental or physical), then from that feeling make a reaction, and how our preferences or personal perception & opinions can affect intention positively or negatively should be considered.  For example, a knife can be used in surgery to treat the wounded, or in day-to-day tasks such as cooking, or in artistic tasks such as carving but at the same time, it can also be applied to harmful acts like killing, injuring or threatening people. The knife itself is just a lump of metal, no more evil or innocent than any other object human beings (or natural causes) have created - in itself it doesn't have a character or conscience before, during or after it is used. Intention in design and manufacture can certainly make it look like it has a character or a power of its own, but it's still just metal that might make other things.  Intention happens many thousands of times in thousands of little ways. For example, when typing words, the mind intends to type each letter in order, so that it acts very quickly in order to cause the words to be typed accurately by the fingers.   This example can be expanded. Knowing where the keys are is important to be able to type each letter so the mind has to intend to move the hands to each letter's space on the keyboard, to press it and release it, then move on to the next letter, all while glancing at the screen occasionally to ensure it is correct and at the same time breathe, see, smell, feel, etc. This is high speed intention to do each part, but the mind does it all on its own.  As each action can be broken down into many smaller actions, there is intention behind each one, and sometimes many intentions happening very quickly. You may intend to move your hand to pick up a glass, but you have to keep the "moving the arm and hand to pick up the glass" intention until you perceive you have touched the glass by sight and/or feel. Then that intention dies away as you don't need it anymore, and a new intention to lift the glass to your lips comes into action (or you can change direction and intend not to pick it up but then let go of it).   It's much like a movie. The moving picture displayed on the screen happens because light is shown through a strip of thousands of static images all in an order showing their subtle changes; this strip is put through a projector and run at high speed - high enough to trick the mind to make many still pictures into a flowing, moving image. The mind simply isn't aware that the moving image on the screen is made of a lot of little images, like a day is just a flow of many thousands of little intentions and actions.  If you don't intend to do something, the body can force you to do it by feeling pain, exhibiting fear, anxiety, or distress, or feeling hot or cold, and so forth. However, intention is a conscious thing. For example, you can manipulate the manner in which you breathe and indeed, you can intend to stop breathing and simply hold your breath, or stop moving the muscles that make the lungs expand and contract. Likewise, you can intend to not use the toilet or bathroom. In each case though, the body very quickly starts to protest at this and forces you to breathe again, or to use the toilet as needed. Yet, at the same time there are certain processes we cannot intentionally change, such as our heartbeat, digestive processes, aging, blood processing, oxygen absorption through the lung tissue and getting rid of carbon dioxide, expelling bodily waste products that soon become toxic through sweating to cool down etc. The body needs to do some of these things to stay alive and healthy.  Given that there are many hundreds of intentions, there are many that can be changed for the better and for the wiser, such as in the case of an intention to be hateful or greedy, manic, or lazy. If you keep observing your intentions until you can see the intention making you think, feel or act, you can also seek to modify that intention, simply by using a conscious intention of a different kind, such as intending to let go of a harmful chain of thought.  Try to see if some intentions are stronger than others which may trump another intention (such as you may intend to make a phone call, but the intention to go to the toilet/bathroom is stronger, so it trumps the desire to make a phone call). Sometimes unskillful or harmful intentions (such as thinking about a thought that makes you depressed, worried or angry) can be pretty strong intentions, so it needs a gentle, compassionate but equally more dedicated and stronger intention to be both kind to yourself and to enable you to let go of the stressful thoughts or feelings. By observing the process, it's not long before you can be adequately disenchanted with a harmful intention, thought or feeling in order to outweigh it, and eventually this will become your new "habitual" approach to the negative thought or feeling. It is all about building your understanding of intention into a useful tool.   As always, knowledge is only of use if you do something with it. Find out if you can shape your intentions in order to make your life more happy, healthy and less harmful. Can you train yourself to intend to be happier, healthier and intend to avoid or let go of harmful things? Only by exploring it and studying your interaction with intentions can you find out.	Find out the ways you can best view intention as it happens. Consider and try to identify two main types of intention. Look at the role intention plays in relation to action. Explore how perception shapes intention. Think about how intention affects objects. Consider why people generally don't notice intention. Test this gradually. Find out how far intention goes in the actions it covers. Decide on whether you can influence intention, be it emotional or psychological types of intention, or bodily function types or intention. Continue to evaluate intention.
Painted furniture can be left alone or finished with a seal, wax, or distressing technique to give it an antique look.  After the paint has dried completely, use a power screwdriver or work by hand to replace the hardware.	Consider adding a finish. Replace the hardware.
You need to use a chalk line and box to mark a straight line on the concrete. This is the area to be cut.; , This works particularly well when working with a sidewalk.   Set the blade depth of your circular saw at 2 inches (50.8 mm). Begin cutting at the edge of the concrete and slowly follow the line you have laid out with your chalk line. I have found keeping the blade wet by pouring water on it as you cut reduces dust and helps keep the blade cooler. This depth of cut will give you a straight edge scoring the concrete to finish breaking the remaining depth and a straight edge at the top to tie in with fresh concrete.    The cut-off saw allows you to penetrate to a depth of 6 inches (152.4 mm). Most driveways, housing slabs and basement or concrete retainer walls are in this range.    Cut concrete to the correct depth. Proceed slowly, maintaining minimum RPMs of the cut-off saw. Slow speed allows the saw to keep from overheating the blade and causing shrapnel-like pieces to be tossed into the air from a broken blade. If you have helpers, have them keep the chalk line free of concrete dust made by the saw cut.	Lay out the area of concrete to be cut. Use a 15-amp circular saw with a diamond or abrasive blade to cut a depth of 2 inches (50.8 mm). Employ a gasoline or electric powered cut-off saw to get the job done when working with concrete deeper than 4 inches (101.6 mm). Follow the same steps as you did in the use of a circular saw and identify your starting point.
Running out of power when you are filming is all to common a problem that even effects professionals. Reduce the risk of running out of power by keeping at least 4 spare batteries and keeping a charger near to where you are filming (if this is possible). If you are working in a remote area power may be inconsistent, so make sure you have a backup to relying on power. Taking these steps reduces power used by camera:   Use viewfinder instead of LCD (this makes a huge difference). If its not possible to use viewfinder(DSLR), dim LCD. Keep batteries warm. Turn off auto focus.  A poorly lit subject not only looks amateur, it is also distracting. To make sure you don't underexpose, use a simple tin foil reflector to light the subjects face and at night use a fast lens. if you cannot light the scene it is easier to recover a slightly underexposed shot than an overexposed shot.  Although there are distinct advantages in being a one man film crew, having others assist you saves both time and a lot of stress, as well as this they can help keep an eye out for your equipment.  Poor sound is a common problem because it is overlooked, you should have someone assist you by recording sound on an external sound recorder, using headphones to monitor it.  Make sure you get more than one angle of something, so you have more options when editing. This is most easily achieved by using a second camera. Follow a 30/1 ratio, so if you are making an hour long documentary film 30 hours. It helps to log your footage while you are shooting, so you can see what else you need.  Heat and humidity can cause problems for your equipment. If you think this will be a problem have a backup camera.  If you are shooting on tapes this is not a problem just make sure they are stored in a cool safe place. The basic principle of backing is you backup in three different locations.     Computer. External hard drive. To back footage onto. Consider a lacie rugged. Recently the Solid state drive, a very stable and fast storage system has come onto the market but it is still very expensive. Online backup. If you are near somewhere with a fast and cheap internet connection, this is a safe way of backing up footage. Beware even with a fast connection it still takes a long time so only back up top priority clips.  When you start editing your documentary you may realise that you need to return to film more. If you are on a small budget this may be challenging, one way you could deal with this is create a trailer using the material you have and try to get more money through crowd funding.	Make sure you are well prepared of any potential power issues. Figure out the best lighting positions for the scene. No crew. Sound issues. Coverage. Heat/Humidity. Backup. Return.
This creates a rich almost "underwater" sound. The more delay is added on the secondary signal the more vibrato and "bubbly" to sound will get. This is most common on acoustic guitar and saw it's golden days of usage in the 80's, not to say it's still not widely used today that is.	Chorus occurs when you duplicate the signal (some units create as many as 8 duplicates), keeping one in real-time and delaying the other only by a hair.
Choose your favorite character from your favorite anime, or choose someone more interesting. Pick a character with an awesome weapon or a cool outfit for the most fun cosplay experience. Get together with a group of friends and dress as the characters from a specific anime or manga, and act out scenes from the story while in character. Whatever you choose, do so well in advance, as you'll need plenty of time to plan and create your costume.; , Many anime characters have long, dramatic hair, but there are also plenty of characters with shorter or mid-length hair. Some have perfectly straight hair, while others' hair is voluminous and curly. Think about your hairstyle. Decide whether you want to use your own hair or get a wig, and cut or dye your hair if necessary. Be creative and don't be afraid to go a little wild - in cosplay, hair comes in all colors, shapes, and sizes.  It can be tempting to go all-out with style when designing your costume. However, while eight-inch heels may look awesome, they're not going to be that much fun to walk around in all day. Compromise on style if it allows you to be more comfortable. This way, you can enjoy wearing your costume and stay in it for longer. Make sure everything fits well, and break in shoes or other items that might give you blisters well before the day of your cosplay.  This part is optional, but having appropriate accessories will give you an extra special look. You can carry LARP weapons like swords or even a replica gun. Decorate your weapon, staff, or other accessory to perfectly match your character's own. Make sure not to carry any real weapons, as these could be dangerous to yourself or others.  Always go for a light makeup because too heavy will give you a fake, raunchy look that will detract from your cosplay. In fact, a good simple makeup will flaunt your beauty even if the costume or hairstyle is not that appealing. Mimic your character's makeup and use it to look more like your character, but remember not to go overboard with it.	Choose a character to cosplay. Plan your hairstyle. Make sure your costume is comfortable. Get any accessories or weapons. Do your makeup.
One major problem with household herbs is a lack of light. If your herbs seem to be wilting, make sure they have enough access to quality natural or artificial light. This may correct the problem and lead to your herbs growing strong.Herbs require natural light to thrive and cannot grow adequately with regular household lights. For the best results, place your herbs near a window or allow them exposure to a natural light source. If this is not an option, stop by a local greenhouse. You can pick up some LED grow lights that will allow your herbs to thrive. Regular lightbulbs will not help your herbs grow.; , A common problem with indoor herb gardens is a lack of humidity. In general, the insides of homes and apartments are less humid than the outdoors. Heaters, air conditioners, and other appliances can dry out air, causing herbs to wilt.Mist your plants once a day with a spray bottle. If the air in your home is very dry, invest in a humidifier. Keep that running in the room where you're growing your herbs.  These places tend to be very dry. They can also cause sudden fluctuations in temperature, which is bad for herb plants. If your herbs are by a radiator, stove, or an air vent, move them elsewhere right away to prevent problems from occurring.Some herbs require specific temperatures during the germination period. Sage seeds, for example, will not grow if the temperature is not between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting herbs, be particularly careful about avoiding temperature hazards., Natural light is always best for herbs. If you have access to a balcony, and the weather does not get too cold in your area, this is the best place to place your herbs.This works best if you have a balcony facing east or west. Make sure your balcony is big enough to accommodate all your herbs. Overcrowding can slow the growth of your plants. You can also look into planting in an exterior window box, if you have one.	Make sure your plants get enough light. Keep the environment adequately humid. Do not place your plants by radiators, stoves, and air vents. See if you have room on your balcony.
To make a fabric slipcover that's tailored to the shape of your chair, you’ll need to begin by taking and writing down precise readings of the dimensions of the chair. Here's a checklist of the measurements you'll want to take:   Height of the back of the chair Width of the back of the chair at its widest point Thickness of the back of the chair Distance from the top of the back to the seat Length of the arms Distance from the arms to the floor Distance from the arms to the seat Length of the seat Width of the seat Depth of the seat cushion Distance from the floor to the lowest fabric edge (if you plan to include a skirt on your slipcover) Distance around the bottom circumference of the chair (if you plan to include a skirt); , Be sure to purchase enough fabric to fit your chair's measurements (plus a little extra for hemming and mistakes).   For maximum durability, choose a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill.Fabric is sold in a wide variety of widths: 36 inches, 42 inches, 60 inches, and all the way up to widths over 100 inches. For slipcovers, it's best to buy one of the wider widths (60 inches or more) because the wider the fabric is, the less need you'll have to sew separate pieces of fabric together. Some chairs are bigger than others, but as a very general rule, about four to six yards of a 60-inch-wide fabric should be enough for a standard armchair.  You’ll need tracing paper in order to make the initial pattern for your slipcover. The most common types of paper used for pattern tracing are freezer paper, Swedish tracing paper, and medical exam table paper.   Freezer paper is relatively inexpensive and thick enough not to accidentally tear, though it’s also harder to see through. Swedish tracing paper is easy to see through and doesn’t tend to tear accidentally, but it’s also relatively expensive. Medical exam table paper is easy to see through and very inexpensive, but it’s also thinner and tends to wrinkle easily.  It’s important to trace the pattern for each section of the chair onto tracing paper before attempting to assemble the slipcover. Without a clearly traced pattern, you’ll end up with an imprecise and ill-fitting cover.   Start by carefully drawing the back, front, seat, and arms of your chair on your tracing paper. Compare your tracings with the measurements initially you took for guidance. If you plan to put a skirt on the chair, you can also draw a pattern for the skirt onto the tracing paper. You'll need a strip of fabric as long as the distance around the base of the chair and wide enough to hang from the bottom of the chair to the floor.  Though the slipcover will eventually cover the chair completely, it's still important to clean the chair beforehand to remove any excess dirt and dust.   If you don't clean the chair before covering it, the chair can get musty after you’ve added the slipcover.  After you’ve traced each section of the chair onto your tracing paper, begin cutting out each pattern. Leave a 1-inch margin around seams and a 2-inch margin around hems.This provides a seam allowance when sewing the pieces together.   Use a pair of scissors and/or an X-acto knife to cut out the paper patterns for your chair. Be careful and take your time with this step--mistakes here can lead to imperfections in your slipcover.  Begin by laying out your fabric with the wrong side facing upwards. Lay your paper shapes down so that they all fit on the fabric.   Carefully trace the edge of each piece, then cut the shapes with a pair of fabric scissors. There are many, many ways to mark your fabric without leaving a permanent mark; the most common include:Disappearing ink fabric pens/markers Tailor's wax (essentially a crayon) Washable colored pencils Tailor's chalk Tracing wheel Sharpies, markers, etc. (use only lightly on the back side of reasonably thick fabrics)  , Once you have cut out each piece of fabric match them up and pin along the shared seams and sew the seams in place.   Pin and sew the cut-out for the front of the chair onto each of the arm cut-outs where they would naturally meet.  Match up the back piece to the piece from the previous step (comprised of the front panel and arms) and pin in place. Then sew the pieces together along the seams you’ve marked.   When you're done, you should have a piece of baggy fabric that fits over the back and arms of your chair.  Match the seat piece to what you’ve already assembled and pin along the seams. Sew the seams in place.   The rear edge of the seat should meet the "back" of the cutout, while the sides should meet the "arm" sleeves.  Pin the strip of skirt material to the seat of the chair and sew it in place.   It should hang so that it is near the floor, but not pooled on it. If possible, try to position the spot where the skirt material crosses over itself in the back of the slipcover where it won't be easily seen.  Tuck the corners of the slipcover into the cushions and arms of the chair.   Gently sit down; your slipcover should feel comfortable and should conform easily to the weight of your body. If it doesn’t you may need to rip out and re-sew any seams that fit irregularly.	Measure your chair. Pick out the fabric for your slipcover. Buy tracing paper. Outline of each section of the chair. Vacuum the chair. Cut out the patterns. Trace the patterns onto your fabric. Join the front and arm pieces. Join the back and front pieces. Join the seat and bottom pieces. Sew the skirt (if any) to the seat. Pull the new slipcover over the chair.
Learn what numbers correspond with what fingers. The chromatic scale uses a unique fingering pattern. It differs from many other typical scale patterns in many ways, mainly because it only uses three of the five fingers. Remember the names of each note of the scale. The chromatic scale contains twelve pitches, each a semitone above or below another. "A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale (e.g. from C to C♯)". It contains every tone between any one note and the same note an octave apart. We will start and end on C, but there is only one chromatic scale. No matter where you start, the fingering will be the same.; ,   Play the first note (C) with your index finger (finger 1). Play the note a half step above the first (C#) with your middle finger (finger 3). As you play the C#, bring your thumb (finger 1) underneath your middle finger (finger 3).    Repeat the motion of the first step, playing the next note (D) with your thumb (finger 1). Play half step above the first (Eb) with your middle finger (finger 3). As you play the Eb, bring your thumb (finger 1) underneath your middle finger (finger 3).    Play the next note (E) with your thumb (finger 1). Play the next two (F, F#) with your index finger (finger 2) and middle finger (finger 3) in that order. As you play the F#, bring your thumb (finger 1) underneath your middle finger (finger 3).    Play the next note (G) with your thumb (finger 1). Play the next half step above the first (G#) with your middle finger (finger 3). As you play the G#, bring your thumb (finger 1) underneath your middle finger (finger 3).    Play the next note (A) with your thumb (finger 1). Play the next half step above the first (A#) with your middle finger (finger 3). As you play the A#, bring your thumb (finger 1) underneath your middle finger (finger 3).    One at a time, play the next note (B) with your thumb (finger 1) and then play the last note (C) with your index finger (finger 2).	Review the basics. Begin playing the scale. Continue playing the scale. Pay attention to the tricky part. Continue playing the scale. Continue playing the scale. Finish the scale.
Determine if the Wax ring is possibly bad by inspecting the floor for water or a foul odor of sewer gas.  If are unsure of where water is coming from you can add food coloring to the toilet tank. If the floor's water is the same color, then you likely will need to install a new wax ring., Begin by shutting off the water at the shutoff behind the toilet. Flush the toilet now. Then remove the supply line. You may want to reuse the line if it a new flexible type, but if it's an old solid draw tube type, it is easiest to cut it with a tubing cutter and replace it with a flexible type.  Use the sponge to get the remaining water out of the tank and bowl. There is a trap built into the toilet, so be aware there may be some remaining water in the toilet even after you do this. This will be important later when you go to move the toilet.  These are the bolts that hold the toilet down on the floor. Sometimes they can just be removed with a deep well socket, but many times they are corroded and have to be cut or broken off. There are many ways to cut these bolts, but the best way I have found is with a rotary tool or one of the new vibrating tools. Cut next to the base of the toilet, not underneath. There is a flange that the toilet bolts to underneath of the toilet. If you mess this up it has to be replaced and the part can be expensive and is a pain to change.  This is not the easiest endeavor. You want to try to keep the toilet level so the remaining water does not come out of the trap. You can rock it forward to break it free of the wax ring, but try to lift it level.  There will be remaining wax on the bottom of the toilet and if you set it on the floor, it'll make a mess.  Clean the floor flange as thoroughly as you possibly can. You must now also tilt the toilet and get the underside clean.  You need 2 new johnny bolts, a new toilet supply line if you are changing it, Teflon tape and a Neoprene floor gasket. Do not get a wax ring. Wax rings are a pain if you do not do this every day. With a wax ring, when it comes time to set the toilet to the floor, you have one chance to get it right. If everything is not lined up perfectly, you have ruined the ring and now have to go get another. The rubber gasket allows you to adjust the toilet into place until everything lines up. Make sure you don't put the gasket in upside down. It will fit the flange very well one way, and not well at all the other.  Place the rubber gasket over the bolts. It will help to hold the bolts upright to mount the toilet. Place two 12" long 2x4 scraps on either side of the flange. Place the toilet one these boards and lie on your stomach in front of the toilet so you can line up the toilet.  If it does not, double check to see if your flange connection is aligned. If it is still crooked but you are sure you have a good connection you will need to use a shim under the lip of the toilet base to level the toilet after you have put some tension on the johnny-bolts.  When you are sure that the bolts are where you want them, you can use a wrench. You can not level a toilet by tightening the johnny-bolts. Do not over-tighten them, because you can crack the toilet, but you are more likely to break the flange. See #4.  Turn on the water and check for leaks. If there are no leaks, you are done.	Inspect the bathroom. Use food coloring. Remove the toilet. Get a good sized sponge and a bucket like the kind you use for washing a car. The next step is to get the johnny bolts free. Now that the toilet is free, it is time to lift it off. Move the toilet out of the way and set it on some newspapers. Use a stick or disposable putty knife to scrape all of the remaining wax that is on the floor flange off and throw it away. Go to the hardware store. Place the new johnny-bolts into the keyhole slots in the floor flange. When you have the toilet lined up, slide each 2x4 out from under the toilet and its should sit down flush with the floor. Finger tighten the johnny bolts. Finally, use the Teflon tape on the toilet water supply and re-attach the supply line.
Before you apply for the permit, you need to gather together all of the paperwork that you need. To apply you need your full US driving license - unless, you don't live in American then, well, work it out, two passport photos, as well as a check covering the cost of the application. The cost of the application should not be more than $20.   The two associations authorised by the US Department of State to process International Driving Permits are the American Automobile Association, and the National Auto Club.If another company is offering to process your claim, it will most likely be more expensive so go directly to one of the officially authorised associations.; , You can apply for an International Driving Permit through the post. Print out a copy of the application form from the website of the American Automobile Association or the National Auto Club and fill in all of your details. You will need to provide all of your address details as well as your driving license details.To apply by post you will need to include a signed photocopy of both sides of your driving license, along with a check for the required amount. You will also need to send the two passport photographs with the completed application form., If you prefer, you can apply for the permit in person. The requirements are the same, you just have to go into the local office of one of the two issuing associations and present them with your license, the fee, as well as the two passport photographs required for the permit., Once your application has been processed, it is just a matter of waiting for it to arrive. It's best to submit the application well in advance of your trip abroad. If you have left it late, it is possible to pay extra for a priority service.Once you have received the permit, you should keep it with your US driver's license at all times.   The International Driving Permit does is not valid for driving in the US so don't think you only need to carry the international permit around with you at home., If you are planning on driving while you are abroad you need to determine if an International Driving Permit is required well before you intend to travel. Many countries will require you to have this permit to drive there. The application process is relatively straight-forward so if you are in any doubt, be sure you get yourself a permit.   You can access a list of countries which accept the permit online. Look on the website of the US Embassy of the country you want to drive in if you are uncertain. If you plan to rent a car, contact rental firms in advance to check the requirements. The permit essentially demonstrates that you are a licensed driver and translates this information into ten languages. Your national driving license might appear alien and indecipherable to a police officer abroad, so having this permit can help with communication., In order to be eligible to apply for an International Driving Permit, you need to have a full US driving license, and be at least 18 years of age. You will need to present your license when you apply for the International Driving Permit, so be sure you have it to hand before you go any further.Your US driving license must be valid six months before the date on which the International Driving Permit is issued., If you are planning on driving abroad you should be certain that you have taken care of any insurance you might require. If you are planning on hiring a car, the insurance costs will be included in the rental agreement. If you are taking your own car, be sure to check you are covered to drive abroad as part of your policy. Most often, you will not be.   If your auto insurance policy does cover you to drive abroad, you may still need to buy more cover to reach the minimum level required by your destination country.If you are uncertain, call up your insurance agency to check your policy and get any extra cover that might be required.  Before you travel it is always a good idea to look up the local rules and regulations for the road. You should seek to gain a good understanding of laws and driving practices before you get behind the wheel in another country. For example, some countries have on-the-spot fines for drivers caught not wearing a seatbelt or using a cell phone.Some countries may have toll roads, or require permits to use certain roads so check this before you go. If you are going to be driving on the left-hand side for the first time, try practising on a quieter stretch of road before heading into a big city. Tourism offices, car rental firms, and government embassy's or consulates are good places to look for information on local driving laws.	Gather the information and paperwork you need. Apply by mail. Apply in person. Keep your US license and international permit together. Discover when you need an International Driving Permit. Be over 18 years old with a full US license. Ensure you have necessary insurance to drive abroad. Check the specific rules for your destination.
Older pipe anchors come loose over time and may need to be tightened or replaced. Pipes are usually anchored to wood floor joists using metal clamps.   Replace these clamps if they are loose, or add more clamps if the pipes are easily moved. Install anchors every 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) on horizontal pipes and every 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) on vertical pipes.; ,   Wrap a piece of rubber around the pipe and secure the wrapped area to the joist with a metal clip. If you don't have pipe insulating foam, a piece of rubber inner tube or garden hose will work. Do this every 4 feet (1.2 m) along length of the pipe. Leave room for expansion around the pipe or anchoring mechanism. This is particularly important when insulating plastic pipes. Avoid galvanized anchors on copper piping. Even small pipe movement can create a lot of noise when metal on metal comes against metal.	Check all pipe anchoring locations. Add cushioning to prevent rattling or banging pipes.
As simple as this step may seem, it may be overlooked in a busy, noisy home. Even though a dripping faucet may not seem to waste significant amounts of water, over the course of day, each individual drop adds up to thousands and thousands of drops, or gallons and gallons of water. Choose a time when there is little or no activity, such as early in the morning, or late at night, when the house is very quiet.; , Pipes that contain water under pressure can become corroded, develop loose fittings, or crack because of freezing, allowing a continuous loss of water until repaired. Mildew or mold, darkened surfaces, or even puddles of water may occur below leaks. If the problem is inside the wall cavity, it may be necessary to remove the paneling, plaster, or wallboard to correct it.   Pipes also may sweat when cold water passes through them in warmer interior air-spaces in the home, and this water condensing on the surface of pipes may drip, causing moisture problems to appear where no leak exists.  Use a flashlight to follow the path of exposed pipes, looking for droplets of water that will accumulate at the lower section before dropping off, and run your fingertips along these pipes to feel for wetness.  When there is a seal leak in the water closet (toilet), the tank will drain slowly over a period of time, until the water level drops sufficiently for the float valve to open and replenish it. Sticking flush valves and leaking seals in toilets can waste a lot of water, since, like dripping faucets, the flow, although perhaps very small, is continuous.   Check the supply valves on lavatories and commodes if they are leaking. The packing, which seals the valve stem of a typical stop (water valve) seals when compressed just enough to "pack off" leak paths, but not so tightly that turning the handle is difficult. Turn the packing nut (top nut surrounding the stem) slightly clockwise (shouldn't require more than 1/8 turn or so) and see if this stops the leak around the stem. #*Supply valves are meant to be fully opened or completely closed. Turn the valve off by turning the handle clockwise until it stops; Open the valve by turning the handle counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) until it stops. Occasionally, a very slight leak of a stem will stop if the valve was partly opened and is either fully closed or opened fully. See also How to Fix a Running Toilet and How to Fix a Slow Toilet.  Municipal water systems use a meter to measure the amount of water used, and by turning off all faucets and appliances that consume water, the flow to your home will cease. Locate your water meter, read the amount displayed, note it, then wait an hour or two, and reread it to see if water has gone through it when none was being used in your home. Very small leaks will not appear to move the meter over a short period of time, so these will be harder to detect using this method.	Listen for dripping sounds. Look for evidence of a leak along the base board of walls near the location of your plumbing fixtures. Look under vanities and sinks for drips or similar evidence noted in the previous step. Listen for noises from your commodes/bathrooms, to determine if they are running at unusual intervals, when no one has recently flushed them. Check your water meter.
Making crayons with carnauba wax will yield a smooth, hard crayon. You can add a little beeswax to get a more traditional crayon.Carnauba wax is also known as palm wax and can be purchased online. You will need about 8-10 grams per crayon.In addition to the wax, you will also need a colorant of some kind. You can use earth pigments, chalk, or cosmetics to color your crayons. Earth pigments and cosmetic pigments can be purchased online. If you are using chalk, simply choose your colors and grind the chalk into a fine powder.Make sure you have an old saucepan to melt the wax in. Find a mold for your crayons, such as a silicone ice stick tray. Your mold should make a crayon about .5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. If your crayon is too thin, it may break.Get 2-3 disposable cups per color of crayon, and have a few extra set aside. Keep some disposable stirring sticks next to the cups. Make sure you have as many sticks as you do cups.; , Decide how many colors you plan on making, and measure out 2-3 grams of each pigment. Put the pigment into disposable cups before you melt the wax to make the mixing process easier. Use one pigment per disposable cup. The only limit to the number of colors you can make is the amount of pigment and wax you have. The amount of pigment you use will determine how vibrant the crayon color is.Make sure you measure out all colors of pigment before you start. Carnauba wax will harden quickly once it is removed from the heat, so prepare as much as you can ahead of time., Place all the carnauba wax into a saucepan and melt it over low heat. Once the wax is completely melted, reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting.If you decide to add any beeswax to your crayons, wait until the carnauba is completely melted. Grating the beeswax before adding it will aid in the melting process. For a more traditional crayon, aim for a ratio of 90% carnauba and 10% beeswax., Add a few tablespoons of wax into one of the cups and place the saucepan back onto the heat. Working quickly, stir the wax in the cup to mix the colorant.It does not take long for carnauba wax to harden, so it may help to have two people for this project. Have one person pour the wax, and one person immediately mix the pigment and the wax together. For a fun addition, try adding a few drops of essential oils to your wax as you mix the pigment in. Find scents that match the colors. For example, use orange oil for an orange crayon, or rose oil in pink or red., As soon as the wax takes on the color of the pigment, begin pouring it into your molds. Silicone ice stick trays work well for a standard crayon shape.Set the molds aside and let the crayons harden for at least 2 hours at room temperature., Work through each color by pouring a few tablespoons of melted wax into the cups one at a time. Quickly mix the wax and the colors together and pour it into your molds.If you have any difficulty with the wax hardening before you can get it set in a mold, flake the wax off and set it aside. Carnauba wax is easy to remelt. Try mixing some of your colored waxes together to create interesting new colors.	Gather your supplies. Measure out your colorants. Melt the wax. Pour the wax. Mold the crayons. Repeat the process.
To become a flight attendant at Air France, or any airline for that matter, you must have a high school diploma. In fact, more than one-third of all flight attendants have college degrees, even though college is not required by the airlines.; ,   Because Air France is based in France, they require that all flight attendants be fluent in both French and English. Speaking a third language is also a benefit as Air France assigns flight crews based on specific areas. For example, for Japanese flights, flight crews who speak fluent Japanese are given first choice for those flights.    Air France has it's permanent headquarters in Europe, requiring employees to be citizens of a European country. To learn what countries belong to the European Union, visit http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm   ,   This certification training teaches fire control, first aid, aircraft evacuation, and other airline safety measures necessary.    Since flight attendant positions require significant contact with the public, gaining experience in customer service positions is beneficial prior to applying at Air France. Since flight attendant positions are difficult to get, having this type of experience may give you a better chance when applying. ,   Flight attendants work many different hours and days. In addition, because Air France flies out of a number of different airports internationally, flight attendants at Air France could be stationed at any one of the 183 airports they fly to and from.	Obtain a high school diploma. Learn to speak French and English. Have citizenship in a European Union (EU) country. Obtain certification in Flight Attendant Emergency Safety that meets the requirements of European Union Operation Procedures. Get experience in customer service. Be willing to work varied shifts.  , Be willing to relocate.
"True leaves" refer to fully grown leaves, rather than leaves that are just beginning to grow.  If you plan on keeping each pepper plant separate, a 2-inch or 4-inch (5-cm or 10-cm) pot should suffice. You can also combine multiple pepper plants into a single pot if it is larger.  Use a loose, well-draining soil, preferably one with a high content of organic matter.  The hole should be the same depth and width of the compartment your seedling currently sits in. If planting one seedling per pot, dig the hole in the center of the pot. If planting multiple seedlings in one pot, dig multiple holes that are at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart.  Gently "wiggle" or pry it from the seedling tray by squeezing on the sides of the plastic compartment. Once the seedling has been removed, roots, soil, and all, place it in the hole.  Pack the soil around the base of the seedling so that it is firm and steady.	Transplant the seedlings once they have two sets of true leaves. Use a large enough pot. Fill the pots with soil. Dig a small hole in the dirt. Transfer the seedling to the new pot. Pack the seedling in place.
There is a lot of sewing gear available to you and it can become overwhelming if you don't settle on a method for collecting. Some approaches to collecting include:   Choose an era. Collect sewing items made for a set period, such as Victorian times, war years, a particular decade such as the 20s or 60s, etc. The advantage of this is that the items can be narrowed down and you can have a lot of fun hunting them down, learning about which items belong to the specific era, etc., and you can focus your budget. A disadvantage to this approach is that you will have to leave items when they don't match your collection and it might become too narrow if the era you have picked is either full of rare and expensive items, or the items become rapidly repetitive. Choose a theme or category. The theme or category approach can work brilliantly in collecting vintage sewing accessories because it is broader than an era and lets you roam widely for items that fit within your theme. Examples of themes might include a focus on thimbles/chatelaines/needle cases/tape measures, etc., (see list below for a whole range of ideas), or it could be slightly broader, such as bone or pearl sewing trinkets, or sewing machine items, etc. Choose a country or region. Collect sewing items made or designed from your country during the decades. After the 60s, many items are made overseas, so the "designed in" aspect might become more important for your collection. Commemorative items. Some sewing items were produced for commemorative purposes. This category might be ideal to base your collection on, provided it is in an area of sewing items that were used for commemorative items, such as thimbles. Alternatively, just collect everything you come across and can afford. Beware though, as this can result in indiscriminate collecting and you will end up with pieces of very little value crowding out the more valuable pieces. It depends on your display space and memory!; , The spectrum of sewing tools and accessories is broad, and there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes an ideal vintage sewing collection. In reality, it's a collector's right to include items that might seem peripheral but in some small way boost your collecting enjoyment. It's also the collector's right to define the collection's extent, with the key rationale being to keep it enjoyable! At its most basic, items that usually are included in a vintage sewing accessories collection include:   Chatelaines Needle books, needle cases, needles, needles in packets Old yarn and thread, especially still on spools, or in original packaging Needle cases Sewing baskets and contents (a delightful rummaging opportunity)  Sewing machine accessories, sometimes also sewing machines depending on age and beauty Sewing kits  Thimbles and thimble boxes Tape measures, especially novelty tape measures, rulers, and gauges  Mending and darning, darners, clamps Sewing box paraphernalia, e.g., fasteners, hooks and eyes, etc.; the older and more interesting, the better Scissors used for sewing, including pinking shears; scissors cases and sets Old beads used for clothing, glass ones are especially prized Buttons (a collectible in their own right) Pin boxes  Pincushions and pins Tatting shuttles, knitting needles, crochet hooks, rug hooks, etc. - bone, ivory, tortoiseshell, Bakelite, plastic, etc.  Embroidery frames Netting needles, lacework accessories Instructional booklets and patterns - for some people, these form a very important part of a vintage sewing accessories collection, including knitting, crochet, tatting, embroidery, and sewing patterns Antique linens - these are sometimes included in vintage sewing collections as the end products of the hard work using the sewing tools.  There are a number on the market, just do an online search in a favourite book store. These will help you with more in-depth knowledge about each of the sewing tools and accessories of interest to you. Importantly, these will provide photographs of accessories, some of which will be completely unfamiliar to you until you have had them explained first. Once you're in the know, you'll know what to look for!  , This is where the thrill of collecting comes into play. There are a number of places to find your goodies, depending on your budget. They include:   Antique stores and shops. Antique fairs, shows, exhibitions.  Museum stores (be careful of reproductions unless you collect those too). Online auction sites - get to know which sellers specialize in selling vintage sewing tools and accessories, as well as keeping an eye out for bargains generally. Try to look internationally, as different countries can sell different items of great interest to you. Online stores that cater to vintage sewing tools and accessories. Family members and friends can be a great source of vintage sewing collectables when they are cleaning out their sewing room or attic, or when a beloved person passes on. Estate sales.  This is especially important when you are starting out, as you won't have a good idea of the worth of the items to begin with. Always keep within a budget and aim to buy items at a price that will ensure you a small profit if you need to sell it on at a later date. Note that:   Rare, older, and good condition items will be more expensive. Resale value is always better for items in good to excellent condition, especially when accompanied by original packaging and elements. Mass manufactured, commonplace, damaged items will be cheaper. Their resale value is dependent on luck and novice collectors.  Collecting vintage sewing accessories for financial reasons would be a fickle choice; if you want to collect for profit, you are better off collecting old wine or fine art! Collect vintage sewing tools and accessories because you love them, and what they represent - the love, effort, and wisdom of those who have used these items through the ages. There is great pleasure in knowing and observing this aspect of your collection.	Decide on whether you want to collect the vintage sewing tools and accessories according to a theme (category), an era, or some other method. Decide what you want your vintage sewing tools and accessories collection to consist of. Get hold of some good books on collecting vintage sewing accessories. Look for your vintage sewing accessories. Compare prices. Collect because you want to, because it fills you with joy.
Make sure that the picture is firmly secured to the hanging device before letting go. If the picture is not firmly secured, it could fall to the ground and the frame or glass could break.          If you are using screws or nails, position the picture so that the screw/nail hooks on to the hanging device on the back of the picture.  Place the level on top of the picture. If the bubble measure remains in the center of the level, then your picture is hung straight. If the bubble is off to one side, adjust the picture until the bubble is in the center of the level.	Carefully position the artwork on the hanging implement of your choice. Use a level to determine whether or not your picture is hung straight.
If you are unfamiliar with pouring concrete, follow the linked instructions to ensure you do so correctly. Be ready to move on to the next steps as soon as you pour.; , Many modern concrete mixes do not need to be compressed, or "tamped", before finishing, and tamping the wrong mix can weaken the slab.Confirm your decision with a professional before tamping.   If you do decide to tamp, simply press the concrete down using any variety of tamping tool (hand, rolling, etc.).  Find the straightest lumber 2x4 you can find and place it across the barriers holding the concrete in place, or "forms". The 2x4 should extend at least a foot past the forms in each direction. This object is referred to as a screed board.  Using the technique described below, move the 2x4 down the forms to remove excess concrete.Use a sawing motion to pull and push the 2x4 across the concrete as you move it down the length of the forms. This sawing motion helps prevent tearing as you level the surface. Tilt the leading edge slightly away from the direction of travel to create a thin cutting edge where the screed board meets the concrete. Keep at least a 1 inch (2.5cm) hump of concrete in front of the edge at all times. This will fill any holes in the concrete's surface. Pour and level in stages for larger projects. At the end of the slab, push the excess concrete against the forms for easy removal with later tools.  The bull float is a flat, long-handled tool used to flatten minor ridges and holes, as well as embed aggregate particles further into the concrete, bringing the smoother "cream" consistency concrete to the surface for better finishing.Move the bull float back and forth across the slab, perpendicular to the direction you moved the leveling board. (In other words, move the bull float between the two forms the 2x4 was resting on.) Slightly lift the leading edge to create a smaller cutting edge of contact, lifting the tool toward you when pushing and away from you while pulling. Don't overdo it; the edge of the tool should remain level with the concrete. Try to finish this process before any "bleed water" leaks out onto the concrete's surface., A darby is a short-handled tool that serves the same purpose as a bull float for smaller projects.A "power float" or "helicopter" is a powered tool used on large projects.   Move the darby back and forth in overlapping arcs until the whole surface has been covered twice. A power float requires two people to place it carefully onto the slab, but only one to operate it. It takes a little practice to work properly, so stay near the center of the slab while you're learning to avoid damaging the concrete's edge., An edging tool is designed to create level edges and corners next to the form, where your larger bull float or darby is less accurate. This will create more durable edges as well as improve the concrete's appearance.Use a back-and-forth motion in a 1- to 2-ft. (0.3–0.6m) area before moving on to the next. As with previous tools, lift the leading edge of the tool. Don't press too deeply into the concrete; this can create impressions that are difficult to remove.  These are called control joints and direct the concrete's inevitable cracking in such a way that appearance and functionality are minimally affected. These should cut 25% of the way through the concrete's depth.The distance between joints should be no more than 24 times the thickness of the slab.If you are working in the imperial system, calculate this by doubling the thickness of your slab in inches and using that measurement as feet. (For instance, a 4" (10 cm) slab should have joints no more than 8' (2.4m) apart.) Every inside corner of your slab and every corner that touches a building or step should have a control joint extending from it, as these are common cracking locations.Use a straightedge or snap line to lightly mark the joints before cutting and keep your tool straight as you cut. A grooving tool works well for most projects. If your concrete has already started to dry and crack, use a dry-cut saw that can cut to the desired depth. For extra large projects, use a long-handled marking tool.  It takes experience to learn the correct timing for concrete, since its drying speed depends on many factors such as the characteristics of the mix and the local temperature and humidity. Here are the basic details:   As the concrete sets, excess "bleed water" will rise to the surface. Wait until this water has evaporated and the wet shine of the concrete has started to disappear. If the concrete is still quite wet and forms ridges when you move on to the next step, wait longer. If the concrete becomes too hard and dry to finish properly, throw additional water onto its surface. This is a last resort as it will result in weakness and scaling in the final slab.  If you are coloring your concrete using a powder that adds color to the top layer, apply this in the amount specified on the label while the concrete still has a full wet shine. It will still require a little more drying before you proceed to the next stage.   Only use on horizontal surfaces and with proper safety equipment to avoid inhalation., This is the final smoothing, bringing the more consistent "cream" of the concrete to the surface for a level, durable finish. Different materials will provide different effects:Magnesium floats are very popular among professionals, since they are lightweight and excellent at opening up the concrete's pores for evaporation. Aluminum floats are very similar to magnesium, but somewhat heavier and stronger (and so a little more difficult to handle). Wooden floats (redwood or hardwood) are cheap but wear out quickly. They create a rough fuzzy surface useful for very stiff concrete or if using colored hardeners (which need to be mixed in with the rougher tool). Laminated-canvas resin floats are used for the same purposes as wood but are a much more durable (and expensive) tool. As before, lift the leading edge slightly and make shallow flat motions across the surface.  Many people skip troweling if they plan to broom, as it only results in minor improvement in that scenario. Troweling without brooming results in a very slick surface (unsafe for surfaces that will get wet) and may cause fine cracks to develop called "crazing".Use a magnesium trowel in much the same way you used previous finishing tools. You can create a very smooth finish by passing over the slab two or three times, waiting for the concrete to dry slightly between passes and lifting the leading edge a little more each time.Steel trowels can also be used, but inexpert timing could cause the steel to trap water inside the concrete and damage it.Troweling too deep or troweling "air-entrained" concrete mixes can release the concrete's air bubbles and prevent it from setting correctly. Larger troweling tools (or other long-handled finishing tools) are sometimes referred to as "fresnos".These are handy for reaching the center of large slabs. Alternatively, use a hand trowel but kneel on wooden boards when you need to be on the slab to prevent leaving deep impressions.  Most people end with a broom finish to create a non-slip surface. You can do this with or without a preceding trowel finish.   Use a medium stiff or stiffer shop broom (the wide rectangular kind). The bristles should be stiff enough to leave noticeable marks, and the concrete should be soft enough to be shaped by them but hard enough to retain them (not sinking back together). Dip the broom into a bucket of water, then shake off the excess (not onto the concrete). Drag the broom gently over the concrete in segments. Overlap the previous segment to ensure full coverage. If the surface is intended to drain, create the grooves in the direction liquids are supposed to flow., The final drying process of concrete takes several weeks, and if "cured" at the correct rate minimizes the chance of later damage.   The simplest method is to wet the concrete's surface and cover it with plastic sheeting. Weigh down the sheet's edges with heavy objects. There are many other ways to keep the concrete wet, but these tend to require more water or maintenance than plastic.Concrete curing chemicals are often used for professional jobs. These come in many varieties, so consult someone familiar with your concrete mix for advice on selecting one.Begin curing as soon as possible. Once begun, keep off foot traffic for 24 hours, light vehicles such as bicycles for 1 week, and car traffic for 2 weeks. Complete curing takes at least 30 days, and longer at the corners and edges., After the concrete has cured for at least a month, use a concrete sealer to make it resistant to liquid damage and easy to clean.Clean the slab well before applying sealant. Apply thinly to avoid puddles. If needed, wait a couple hours (or as the label instructs you), then apply a second layer perpendicular to the first. Allow sealant to dry completely before walking over or placing anything onto the concrete. Wait three days before allowing vehicle traffic.	Pour the concrete. Compress the concrete only if necessary. Place a 2x4 across the concrete. Use the 2x4 to level the concrete. Immediately level and prepare further using a bull float. Use an alternative tool (optional). Tidy the corners using a smaller tool. Cut grooves into your concrete. Wait for the concrete to partially dry. Apply a color hardener (optional). Smooth and compact the surface once again with a hand float. Consider a trowel finish. Try a broom finish. Cure the concrete. Seal the concrete.
The flexible hose will most likely be a rubber hose (sometimes it may be braided steel) leading from the central brake line to the caliper piston in disc brakes or the wheel cylinder in drum brakes. To disconnect the hose, you should remove the retainer clip between the hose and the steel line. Next, you can turn the connector with a wrench until it comes loose.         Do not crank too much on these connections. If you do you may bend the metal brake lines and then have to replace them as well. Instead, drain the line by cutting the brake hose and use a torch to heat the connection. This will break it loose and you can remove it.; , The brake hose may be mounted to the strut or another sturdy point between the central line and the wheel. You will need to locate any such connections by tracing the line from end to end. Loosen and remove any mounting connections you find.  Now that the hose is disconnected from the lines to the master cylinder, you need only remove it from the brake itself. To do this you need to loosen the bolt found at the end of the brake line (known as a banjo bolt). This is often done with a 14mm socket or wrench, but the size can vary depending on make and model. There is also a washer on either side of the brake line (between the line and banjo bolt and the line and brake) that needs removed.  To attach the new brake hose, you will simply reverse the steps you took to remove the original. This means putting the washers in first, then tightening the banjo bolt at the end of the brake hose.  First, attach the retainer clip. This holds the brake hose in place while you make the connection and is usually attached by sliding it into the appropriate holder at the end of the brake hose. Next, fasten the connector between the brake hose and lines leading the the master cylinder. This should be done with a wrench or flare nut wrench. You should also reconnect any brackets that hold the line secure (often found on the struts or other steering component).  Bleeding the brakes is necessary to remove air that you have introduced into your brake line. Open up the bleeder cap found on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder and have someone pump the brake to force the air out of the bleeder cap. Wait until you see fluid coming out of the bleeder cap, and then close the cap.         There are also pressure bleeders and gravity bleeders available for bleeding brakes.	Disconnect the hose from the brake system. Remove any brackets or bolts along the flexible line. Remove the hose from the brake caliper or wheel cylinder. Attach the new hose to the brake caliper or wheel cylinder. Attach the new hose to the brake system. Bleed the brakes.
They're most common in churches, but some schools have them, or you may even be able to find a large community choir. All programs are different, so if you live in an area with more than one choir nearby, look into your options. Some programs are more structured and serious while others are more for fun. Especially in churches, the members are often older, but it's not unusual to see a handbell choir with people of many ages, or even one for young people only. Find one that you think you will feel comfortable being a part of.   If there isn't an active choir in your area, you might want to find some other interested people and work to start one.  You should know how to read music. Handbell music is written on a grand staff, much like piano music, meaning you should be able to read treble clef and at least some bass clef, depending on how many octaves of hand bells are in your choir. You will need to be able to internalize a beat, since you may or may not have a conductor. A basic knowledge of music theory (mainly chords) may also be helpful.  A good way to think of a handbell choir is like a piano, where each person only controls a few keys. Most small church or school choirs only have two or three octaves of bells, and you will probably be given two bells to start off. The bells are to be kept in keyboard order (lowest to highest, when going left to right, and in chromatic order) as much as possible, and you will take your place between the people playing the closest bells to you. When hand bell music is played well, it can be very beautiful and unique-sounding, which is why it's so popular in churches. Handbells are also as much of a visual art as they are a musical art; you'll see why if you watch a choir perform. They all ring with the same technique.  The bells vary in size based on their pitch; obviously, lower bells are larger and thus heavier, and vice versa. The handle should indicate the note (pitch as represented by a letter and octave number), and some brands make the handles of flat/sharp bells black and leave the others white, much like the coloring of a piano keyboard. Inside the bell is the clapper, which is the part that strikes the bell and causes it to produce sound. There is a rotating piece on the clapper that can be used to control volume. A solid edge hitting the bell produces the loudest sound, while rotating the clapper to a setting with a hole in it makes a softer sound.  Some brands have a marking on them indicating which way you should be holding them; for instance, Malmark bells have a picture of a bell on the handle on one side, which should be facing you.; , When you reach the bottom of your circle, snap your wrist. This should produce a sound. Continue the circle until the bell comes to rest at your chest, where it started.  Damping the bell causes it to stop vibrating immediately instead of letting the sound taper off and continue ringing for a while. If you are damping a very large bell, you may need to place your hand on it as well. Alternatively, bells of all sizes can be damped on the table or any other soft surface.   Sometimes, creative ways of damping bells can be used to add to the visual appeal of a handbell choir's performance.  You should be able to ring well with both hands, regardless of which is your dominant.  When you're playing whole notes, take your time making a large, graceful circle with a dainty wrist snap. When you're playing eighth notes, the bell shouldn't move far from your body at all.  You only control two or three of the notes in the whole "keyboard" right now. You must work to play together with the other members of your choir to sound like one instrument.  If you're playing F4 and G4, marking all of your notes with a highlighter or pencil before you start playing should make it easier to keep track of where you're playing. In time, you may grow out of needing to do this.  If you have a conductor to watch, that's great, but not all choirs do. Learn to count in your head or subtly tap your foot so that you know when to play.  Playing handbells is a musical experience different from playing any other instrument that many people do not ever get to have. Enjoy what you're doing, or it's not worth doing in the first place.  Handbell music has its own special markings and directions that you will never see on other music. For instance, instead of trilling, handbells "shake" (usually indicated by the letters Sk on the music). This is exactly what it sounds like; instead of just playing the note, letting it ring, and damping it, you shake the bell for the notated length of time. There are also markings that tell you to damp in certain ways; for instance, damping on the table, or purposely bringing the bell to the table with force as to create a certain sound.  This technique makes it much easier to play more than two bells at once. To do this, put two bells together through their handles in a way that they are all facing a different direction. You will want two or three bells in each hand. You will discover that you can move your arm one way to play one of the notes in that hand and a different way to play the other one. Obviously, this is easier with smaller bells.  Sometimes this is written into the music, and other times it is a decision made by the director. To pluck, lay the bells down on the table as you normally would, and lift up the clappers and gently drop them, instead of ringing.  To do this, lay the bells down on (in keyboard order, of course), and gently tap them with mallets instead of playing.   Be aware that you do need to use special mallets intended for handbells. Smaller ones are for smaller bells, and larger ones are for larger bells. Often, the range of bells a particular size of mallet is used for will be marked somewhere on the handle.  There are many different ways to do this. Some soloists set up a table with an octave or two of handbells and play all of them, usually with some kind of accompaniment. Others play simple melodies four- or six-in-hand. It's all up to you.	Find a handbell choir in your area. Know some basic music fundamentals, or be prepared to learn them fairly quickly. Understand the basic idea of a handbell choir. Familiarize yourself with the anatomy of a handbell. Begin by putting on gloves (worn by most choirs to avoid smudging or tarnishing the handbells) and picking up two bells and holding them in front of your chest, either angling towards you or facing straight up, depending on the way your choir has chosen to stand with the bells up. To ring one bell, move it forward by extending it away from your body in a circular motion, with the handle moving slightly ahead of the bell. Damp the bell by touching it lightly to your chest when you complete the circle. Repeat until you are comfortable with this motion, and then try with the other bell in your other hand. Understand that the length of time you spend ringing (and thus, the size of your circle) varies according to the length of the note you are playing. Understand your role as a member of a handbell choir. Mark your music, if you find it helpful at first. Keep the beat. Have fun. Once you have mastered basic handbell playing fundamentals, move on to more advanced techniques. Learn to play bells four- and six-in-hand. Try plucking the bells. Try playing with mallets. Venture into the art of solo handbells.
Both the time and the location of meteor showers are predictable. Look online for a meteor calendar to find out what meteor showers will be happening in your area in the near future.A meteor shower always appears from the same point in the sky, which is known as the "radiant". The meteor shower usually gets its name from the constellation that contains that radiant. Meteor showers happen year-round, with the month of November being the most active time. You can see a meteor in the night sky at any time, but if you want the best chance of seeing one (or many) plan your outing around a meteor calendar. The table above outlines the major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere region. Peak dates change slightly from year to year.; , Before you set off to view the next meteor shower that will be happening near you, check a lunar calendar to figure out what phase the moon will be in on that night. If the moon is too bright, you may not be able to see any meteors.Avoid attempting to view meteors during the moon's full or gibbous phases. The best time for viewing is when the moon is between new and first quarter, as this is when it casts the least amount of light and sets before midnight.  In addition to checking the lunar calendar, you will need to check the weather forecast for the evening that you plan to view a meteor shower. Poor weather can easily put a damper on your meteor-viewing experience.The best conditions for watching meteor showers are dry and clear. If it is very cloudy, you may not be able to see any meteors. If it is raining or snowing, you will not only have a low chance of seeing any meteors, but you will also be extremely uncomfortable sitting outside.  If the moon phase and weather conditions are both favorable for viewing a meteor shower, you will need to know exactly when to plan your meteor-viewing outing. Meteor shower typically peak between midnight and dawn, so you will have to plan on being up during the wee hours of the night.Take a long nap during the day if you plan to stay outside watching for more than an hour or so. Set an alarm if you plan to sleep. You don't want to miss out on the opportunity to view a meteor shower because you overslept.  You need an unobstructed view of the sky to properly view a meteor shower. Do your best to find a spot with no buildings or trees.Parks make excellent viewing locations as long as there aren't too many trees. Try scouting out locations a few days prior to the meteor shower. This will help ensure that you have a prime viewing location.  Light from buildings, cars, and streetlights can make it much more difficult to see meteors. Get as far away from all sources of artificial light as you can for the best viewing experience.If you live in the city, you may have to travel farther to find a suitable viewing location. The more regular stars you can see in the night sky in a given location, the better that spot will be for viewing meteors.  If you want to see a meteor shower, you will be sitting outside for a good amount of time, so it's important to keep your basic comfort in mind. Watching the meteor shower will be much more enjoyable if you are well-prepared and have everything you need.   It can get quite cold outside depending on the time of year and where you're located, so don't neglect to dress warmly. It's also a good idea to take blankets and warm drinks with you for cold-weather viewing.No matter what time of year you plan on watching the meteor shower during, consider bringing a reclining chair. This will be much more comfortable than sitting with your neck craned towards the sky.You may also want to bring some snacks and have a late-night picnic while you're star gazing.  Most meteor showers can be seen easily with the naked eye, so you really don't need to worry about having fancy equipment. You can bring binoculars and telescopes if you like, but be aware that these will limit the scope of your view. This means you may be less likely to see meteors if you use them, although you'll definitely get a closer look if you're lucky enough to spot one.It is a good idea to bring a red-tinted flashlight, as this will help you see where you are going without disrupting your natural night vision., When looking for the showers, always look toward the radiant. A constellation chart can help you identify where the radiant should be for each meteor shower. Remember that the shower is typically named after the radiant constellation.Relax your eyes instead of staring intently at the constellation. This will help you see a larger area, so you will be more likely to notice meteors in your peripheral vision.  Many astronomers enjoy recording what they see while watching a meteor shower. You can do this in one of several ways, depending on your own personal preferences.You may want to simply tally the number of meteors you see using a pen and paper. You can count shower meteors (those that originate from the radiant, or the constellation after which the meteor shower was named) and non-shower meteors (those that originate in other locations) separately. If you plan on writing this down, you will definitely need to use a red-tinted flashlight to help you see. If you don't want to have to worry about writing anything down while you're star gazing, take a recording device with you and simply dictate what you see. You can write it all down later if you wish. If you have a digital camera with a good lens, you can use it to photograph meteors, although it's a good idea to read up on astro-photography first.	Research when and where meteor showers will be occurring. Check the moon phase. Confirm that the weather will be clear. Plan to stay up late or get up early. Find a wide-open spot. Make sure your viewing location is as dark as possible. Consider your comfort. Bring the right viewing equipment. Know where to look. Consider recording what you see.
Read the instructions that came with your loom and set it up like the directions say. Make sure the U-shaped pegs are facing up. The arrows should be facing away from your body.; , Place your first rubber band diagonally on a peg. Starting with the first middle peg is recommended. It doesn't matter what side you go to when you move the band diagonally, but stick with it.  Place the second band diagonally from the first band, with the last peg you placed a band on serving as the starting point.  Repeat those steps, reversing the direction of the diagonal each time, until you have what looks like a zig-zag all the way down the loom.  Flip the rainbow loom so now the pegs are facing downwards. The arrows should be pointing towards your body. This will help you grab the bands to weave them.  Use the hook to grab the second band on the first middle peg from underneath the first band.  Flip the band on your hook so that it bends in half (bent over the band above it) and place it over the second peg in the next row. Whether it is to the left or right depends on what you chose earlier.  Continue the process across the whole Rainbow Loom. You should end up with something that looks like the image above (like a series of connected circles).  Get a C-clip or an S-clip from your kit. Hook it onto the last rubber band.  Remove the rubber bands from the loom, carefully. Stretch the bracelet out.  Connect the end of the bracelet to the C-clip.  Enjoy your new bracelet. Now that you're finished, keep making more!	Set up your Rainbow Loom kit. Place the first band diagonally. Place a second band. Repeat the process. Flip the loom. Use the hook. Place the band. Repeat this process. Add the clip. Remove the bands from the loom. Connect the ends. Done!

If the mixture holds together as it slowly runs down the spoon and into the bowl, it is ready.  Pour 8 ounces of Johnson’s Baby Shampoo into the 5-gallon bucket. Add several drops of green food coloring to the mixture. Stir until the slime turns green.   Add more green food coloring if needed.	Gather the ingredients and tools. Combine the Jell-O, flour, and water in a 5-gallon bucket. Add the remaining flour and water. Add the Johnson’s Baby Shampoo and green food coloring.
Leave your phone in the other room when you are doing your homework or cooking, or whatever you are busy with. Having the device at arms reach is just a distraction. You will get more work finished, more efficiently, if you remove that phone from the room entirely. As for your computer, you may need it while you are doing some of your work, but for many tasks, you don't really need it handy. So if you have a laptop, stow it elsewhere when you are busy. This way maybe you will stop running to it every time you think about checking in with your Tumblr contacts. If you have a desktop, pull yourself away and busy yourself in some other room of your house.; , Go out of your house. Establish a daily walking routine or go to the gym. Play sports. Walk the dog. Take the kids to the park. Turn that phone off while you are out and about. Wait until after your daily exercise before you use electronics. This will increase the amount of time you are outside being healthy, and will decrease the period of the day when you are stuck to those screen devices of yours.  Make a hard and fast rule that you will not pick up your phone or your computer until after lunchtime. This way you know you can attend to your email in the afternoon, after you have already addressed all your morning priorities. Those emails can wait a few hours, and you will get your important things done before you even see those. Many of the messages will just be distractions from your own goals, so make sure you get your own things done first, during your electronic-free morning.  Do some of that housework you have been putting off! Or organize your office space. Remember that monster under the bed, or that junk pile in your desk drawer? Well get those gloves on and kill it! Now's a good time to do all that stuff you had promised yourself to do. Again, delay using your electronics until after you have done the dishes, or until after you have vacuumed the floor. Wait until your bathroom is thoroughly scrubbed before you open that laptop screen. Clean your home to the core! Handle every piece of mail. It's a great boredom killer and it'll distract you from that craving of your iPod.  Read all kinds of books that interest you. Subscribe to a magazine. Take the paper. Make library visits a part of your weekly routine. Choose books on various topics and set aside an hour for reading each day. If you are still in school, make your teacher proud and start reading some classics. You'll find that the movie played in your mind is way better than Netflix!  , Go shopping or anything you like. Maybe join a club, and meet people with similar interests to you. Start a hobby. Play tennis, or start playing the bagpipes! There's more to the world than Flappy Bird! The more you get involved in real life activities, the less you are going to be having your nose stuck in that phone.  Sometimes you are on Facebook, and you can't pull yourself away, because you are looking at yet another post, even though you are tired and need to get some sleep. And you are probably looking at a conversation between the second and third cousins of some acquaintance you hardly even ever knew way back in grade school. These are not important posts for you to read! X out the page. Close the computer. Go to bed. While you are at it, just log out of Facebook. This will make it a little more inconvenient to get back in to Facebook the next time you think about entering a time sucking site like that.  Log out of, or uninstall, most applications you may have active on your phone. Pinterest? Flickr? Facebook? Candy Crush? No. You do not need to be roaming around people's boards and pages and playing daft games whenever you happen to have a free minute. Take one of those applications off your phone today. Remove another tomorrow and another the next. Pretty soon you will not have anything left on your phone except the essentials. Those games and apps which are not on your phone, cannot distract you from the important things in life.  Do whatever you like. Make arrangements with friends at least a couple of days each week. See play. Go hear some live music at a coffee shop. Enjoy your life. Embrace not having texting thumbs, or headaches. Smile and enjoy what the world has to offer.  Write to your mom. She will be so pleased to get a card or a letter from you!  , Learn to draw or paint. Learn about color, line, design. Learn tole painting, or knitting. Spend your time making something nice for your house, or for gifts for someone's birthday or an upcoming holiday.	Put electronic devices away. Get outdoors. Have a None till Noon. Clean up. Read. Do errands. Leave a site when bored. Remove applications. Enjoy life without electronic devices. Write a letter. Dive into the arts.
Come up with a figure you’d ideally like to pay to rent an RV. Do some quick research online or at an RV dealer to get an idea of what some typical rental prices are. You may need more beyond your decided number for deposits or to negotiate. It’s helpful to come up with a maximum number that you absolutely won’t go over.   Write down the number of nights and the approximate number of miles of the trip you plan to take in an RV. RV rentals will often have a per night and/or per mile rate, so it’s helpful to have these numbers on hand to estimate rental prices.; , There are towable RVs—like travel trailers and camper trailers—that attach to the back of your vehicle, and there are motorized RVs—like type A, B, or C motorhomes—that are self-contained with a driving cab.It’s important to decide on an RV type according to your needs, the number of people you’re traveling with, the price you’re willing to pay, and your vehicle’s towing capacity if you’re choosing a towable RV. Opt for a smaller RV for easier navigation if you can, especially if you’re a first-time renter.   For a towable RV, you’ll generally need a vehicle with a high towing capacity, a hitch rated at 5,000 pounds, and an electronic brake controller installed in your vehicle or the proper wiring to rent and attach one.In most states you need only a normal driver’s license to operate any RV recreationally, but some states do require a special commercial or non-commercial license for larger/heavier RVs. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation., Expect to see rental prices per night for RVs, and know that the same renter can have different per night rates depending on the season (usually rates are higher in peak vacation months like July and August). There could also be a per mile rate, which might be something like 34 to 45 cents per mile. Rates will also vary by the type, size, and condition (or age) of the RV.Note that some rental companies will want to place a hold on your credit card while you’re in possession of the vehicle.  Expect extra costs beyond the rental rate for possible things like a security deposit, a small charge for the RV’s generator or propane, additional vehicle insurance, and the price for kitchen utensils and bedding if you’re not providing your own.Of course the cost of your trip will also include gas for the RV, campground rates, and food costs.  Check out the For Rent ads in your local newspaper, Craigslist, or other classified ads for RV rentals. Many private owners will rent out their RVs for reasonable prices when they aren’t using them. Also check out local or national RV dealers with rental locations near you.  Call up the renters you find to make sure they’re still offering the RV offered in their ad, and ask about any additional costs there are on top of the per night or per mile rate to get an idea of the true price you’d pay. Choose your favorites based on the best features and price, and narrow your options down to a number that you can reasonably spend the time to visit before booking and embarking on your trip.  Call your prospects again to set up a time to meet. Get a thorough tour of the inside living space and ask to take a test drive if it’s a motorhome. Larger rental companies will be more equipped to give you a full tutorial, often including an educational video. No matter who you’re renting from, be sure to check that everything works properly and ask questions like:   How do I properly hitch and unhitch a towable RV? How and where do I empty wastewater and sewage? How and when do I run the generator, and at what cost? How do I use the propane to light the stove, run the refrigerator, etc., and at what cost?  , You’ll usually need a driver’s license and car insurance for anyone that will drive or tow the RV. Get copies or receipts for any paperwork or transactions you complete.  Make sure you understand all the upfront costs as well as charges you could face later for damages or generator and propane charges.  Especially if you’re renting from a private seller, you may be able to compromise on a price. Let them know your budget, and see what they can offer you. Come up with a rate that they can agree on that doesn’t go over your maximum budget.   If you’re not happy with their final offer for rent, walk away from deal. They might come back to you with a lower price if they want to rent the RV quickly.  Discuss with the renter if they have options for a payment plan. You make be able to make smaller payments over a longer period of time if you wish.	Pin down your budget. Determine the type of RV you need. Compare prices. Consider extra costs. Check classifieds and local dealers. Narrow your search. Arrange to visit and test-drive. Bring your ID or any other necessary materials. Determine if there is a deposit or charges for damage. Negotiate if you can. Agree on a payment plan.
For typical small jewelry such as an earring, you'll want a strip of sterling silver at least 2.5 inches wide and no more than 3.5 inches long. You can adjust these dimensions if you have a specific design in mind, but it may become a little harder to work with. 22 gauge and 24 gauge sheeting are commonly used.   Sterling silver may be labeled "ster" or ".925.", Silver is soft enough to be cut by a jeweler's saw, but will need buffing afterward to smooth out the sharp edges. These specialized tools can be found at craft stores, hardware stores, or online.   A jeweler's saw with a saw blade numbered 2/0 A small buffing machine with canton flannel wheels (or a bench grinder with the grinding wheel replaced)Jeweler's rouge or blue polishing compound. (Scratched silver may require white rouge or brown Tripoli polishing compound instead.) For earrings: sterling silver ear hooks, a drill, and a number 64 drill bit For surface designs: a metal stamp and hammer.  Insert the saw blade into the upper end of the jeweler's saw and fasten the wing nut. Insert the lower end and tighten the wing nut while pulling on the frame to add tension. The buffing machine may already come pre-assembled, or you may need to consult to add the buffing wheels according to your model's instructions. Mount the buffing machine on your workbench.   To test the saw, stroke the blade with a fingernail and listen for a "Ping" sound. If it does not make this sound, tighten the saw until it does when stroked.  You can sketch out the shape yourself, or find a design online or in magazines. For a pair of matching earrings, make two identical copies.  Tape the design over the silver sheeting and use the saw to cut through the outline.   Use a slightly forward tilt to the saw as you cut. Move the saw up and down as you cut.  The easiest way to add detail to the surface is to purchase a stamp designed to imprint silver. To stamp a thin sheet of silver, lay the stamp over the metal and hammer it in firmly. Make sure the stamp stays flat and in position while you hammer it several times.  Following your model's instructions is recommended. Generally speaking, the jeweler turns on the machine and applies polish (jeweler's rouge) sparingly to the wheel. Gently touch the jewelry to the surface of the wheel to smooth out rough edges and polish the surface., This will remove polish residue. Dry with a soft, clean cloth, preferably wool or chamois., Drill a small hole near the top of each earring, insert one end of the hook, and twist the hook around itself or tuck it over the earring edge to attach it firmly. Obviously, you can skip this step if making jewelry that does not require a hook attachment	Pick the silver. Gather supplies. Assemble the jeweler's saw and buffing machine. Choose a design that you would like to use. Cut the silver in the chosen shape. Stamp the clay (optional). Polish the jewelry on the buffing machine. Wash in warm soapy water. Attach an ear hook to each earring.
Fill a sock with silica cat litter. Tie off the end with a piece of string, and then place one or two full socks near the front of your dashboard. This should absorb the moisture inside your car over night, preventing any fog buildup., Use the type of shaving cream that foams up when you squirt it out of the can or bottle. Spray a small amount of cream onto a soft cotton cloth and spread it over your entire windshield. Use a clean, dry rag to wipe it off. This should create a moisture barrier on your window, preventing fog build up., If your car is in a secure area, roll your windows down about a half inch or so. This allows some outside air to get in to the car, and can prevent the windshield from fogging.This method is best for the summer time, since you don’t want to risk any ice or snow getting into your car during the winter.	Use silica cat litter. Apply shaving cream to your windshield. Roll your windows down if you can.
Sweet peas destined for indoors should be picked before the flowers are fully open. Some people suggest waiting until the lowest blossom on the stem has just started to open.; , Place the base of the stems in a naked flame (a candle is fine). Alternatively, place them into boiling water for a few minutes. , Stand the sweet peas in a vase filled up to the neck of the stems with cold water.	Pick sweet pea flowers early. Burn the stems. Put them in a vase immediately.
A hobby may be just the thing. Play your instrument, do gymnastics, throw some footballs to your sibling, etc.; , For a challenge play classic games like tag or jumping on the trampoline with the added challenge of water spraying you.  Grab your younger or older sibling if you have one and get building. Customize it as much as you want and make it your own.  Your room would be ideal. But, if your room is as tidy and organized as can be, clean another room. You and your family will be proud of yourself.  If older, try playing with someone young.  Such as; Your stranded on a deserted island. The thing you don't realize is the island is haunted.

The first-generation Mustangs were manufactured from 1964 to 1973, and they were referred to as the "original pony car." If you are looking for a "Pony Interior," the vehicle will have a running ponies design on the front seat. It also has armrests, woodgrain appliqué accents as well as a round gauge cluster. The 1966 was the best selling convertible model. Mustangs prior to 1979 in Germany are referred to as the T-5, or the pre-production name of the vehicle, because of copyright issues in that country. Vehicles from 1967-1968 and older will give you a larger cargo and seating area. Revisions to the cars in the 1970s made them heavier vehicles. Whatever year you choose, you can select a hardtop, sports roof or convertible model.; , Begin with the classified section of your newspaper by scoping out the advertising section as well as the personal classifieds. Purchasing your Mustang locally will be a tremendous cost saver in terms of delivery or shipping.  These can typically be found at gas stations or convenience stores, and you should look for them in the racks located by the doors or sometimes in wall racks along the outside windows.  Use an online search engine to help find just the right vehicle for you.   ClassicMustang.com can help you with a specific search. They take special orders on vehicles in good condition. You can find vintage Mustangs from any era at http://mustangclassifieds.com/. Start your search by year, and then browse by price, exterior color, interior color, engine and transmission types.  http://mustangtraderonline.com/. is another online resource to help you with your source. , The Kelley Blue Book is a trusted vehicle valuation source that can help you settle on an asking price.  The sources that you will find for vintage vehicles are typically only the middleman, and you will need to contact the person selling the vehicle directly.   Determine if the price is negotiable, and if so start with a price that is lower than asking. This will allow you some wiggle room on negotiations. Discuss the shipping or delivery details for the vehicle. The seller can take the reigns and ship or deliver the car him or herself, of depending on the distance and the arrangements, you may have to fly to his or her location and then fly back.

Imagine that Sirius, Beta and Omicron 2 form the corners of a giant parallelogram.
Concrete flooring that has been poured recently (in the last 10 years or so) is more likely to have been smoothed and troweled mechanically. What that means is that even through mechanically troweling the floors creates a nice, smooth top surface, it is too smooth for the acid stain to penetrate through.So, keep that troweling method in mind along with a few other conditions when figuring out if your concrete surface would be a good surface for acid staining:   For concrete surfaces that are older, power-washed, or have been profiled using a machine, the surface of the concrete has to be virtually pristine before adding an acid stain. That means there should be no areas of damage revealing exposed underlying concrete or sand granules. If there are areas that are damaged, those areas are going to absorb the acid stain abnormally, and may cause areas of inconsistent coloring.The concrete slab should be free from waterproofing agents, or muriatic acid. The acid stain reaction cannot occur on surfaces treated with these products.You can usually tell if a concrete surface has a layer of waterproofing by performing a water test. All you do is pour water onto the concrete surface. If the water beads up and does not absorb into the concrete, it’s treated with a waterproofing agent. If the water sinks into the concrete, your concrete should readily absorb acid stain.; , The current condition of the concrete is one of the biggest factors to consider when acid staining is the current condition of the concrete. An initial questions to ask yourself before staining is, “What’s on the floor now?” Depending on the answer, your concrete surface could be ready for cleaning and a direct acid stain (meaning applying the acid stain directly onto the concrete surface in its current condition), or more floor prep (and possibly a surface modification) before the acid stain application.Some other factors that can affect your acid staining include different flooring material covering the concrete surface, how the concrete surface was troweled, if the concrete has ever been patched or repaired, and if there was carpeting, if the carpet underpad was glued onto the concrete. The ideal candidates for direct acid staining are usually new construction projects (where nothing has been applied to the concrete floor and it has been kept clean), and exterior projects. Remodels are harder, as any imperfections left behind from the previous floor covering (tile, linoleum, wood, carpet, laminate, etc.) will show up to some degree in the final acid stained concrete floor.Remodels mostly require more prep work before the acid stain application.  Sprinkle or spray water in several places on the concrete surface. If the water beads and the color of the concrete doesn’t change in the areas you sprayed, then a barrier (usually a sealer) is present on the concrete surface, and must be removed during the floor prep process.This barrier must be removed because it will prevent the acid stain from even penetrating the concrete surface.   You can remove this barrier by sanding the top layer of the concrete, or applying a micro finish overlay on top of your concrete. These barrier removal steps may also require a combination of chemical cleansers to dissolve any additions made to the concrete's surface.  Not all concrete surfaces will require this step, but for surfaces that have a chemical barrier on top of the concrete, are too smooth because they were machine troweled, or contain excessive contaminants from previous flooring, may all need some surface modifications. This is when sanding or a micro finish overlay may be required.   Sanding the floor with a high-speed buffer and an 80-grit sanding pad provides a roughened concrete surface that helps ensure maximum adhesion of the acid stain. Sanding also helps to remove superficial contaminants like paint or surfaces stains, while removing the top layer of a sealer. After sanding, the entire floor will feel like sandpaper and the surface debris will all be sanded away.A micro finish overlay is a thin, smooth coat of concrete that resurfaces the floor to cover up defects left behind from previous flooring. This is because any residue from your previous flooring (carpeting glue, nail holes, tile adhesive outlines) can leave a “ghost image” that shows up later in acid staining process.A micro finish overlay is a little more expensive than a direct acid stain, but the resurfacing virtually eliminates all imperfections on the floor, and creates an even, covering over the original concrete that ends up looking a lot like leather.This step could get tricky for someone doing this project by themselves, and may require the professional assistance.  Once you have made your concrete surface ready for proper acid staining absorption, you need to clean the concrete surface. There are a few different concrete cleaners that can rid your concrete surface of impurities in their own way.   Knowing the differences between these cleaners will allow you to clean your concrete surface with a cleaner best suited for your surface’s deposits.  A pH cleanser is mild in nature, and are normally used for cleaning indoor concrete surfaces that are already sealed.These pH cleaners can also be used on unsealed exterior or interior concrete that only requires gentle, non-irritating cleaning., These are the most popular types of concrete cleaners. Acidic cleaners are mainly used to get rid of staining, dirt contamination, and other contaminants that can be broken down by its acidic properties.Acidic stains come in ready-to-use applications or more concentrated solutions, and they are applied right onto any area that is affected by contamination. Acidic cleaners sometimes need to be scrubbed into the contaminated areas, and may even require more than one application., Alkaline cleaners are mostly used to get rid of tough stains like oil, grease, or other hard to remove hydrocarbon-based stains.These cleansers are very effective in breaking down oily and greasy contaminates due to the high alkalinity. Alkaline cleansers reap the best results when the cleanser is scrubbed into the concrete stains.A big mistake people make when using this cleanser is not giving it enough time to work its magic and remove the stain. Depending on how bad the oil stain is and how far it has seeped into the concrete, you made need to apply this cleanser many times to fully eradicate the stain. Each application will require a sitting time of approximately 3 hours., Protect your walls from getting acids stain on the bottoms and edges by covering them with masking paper.Cover all exposed walls by pulling the masking paper tightly across the wall (covering the areas closest to the floor), and securing the back of the paper to with wall with double sided tape (a piece of tape taped onto itself, sticky side out, making a loop).   Spread the tape out about every 12 inches to ensure the masking paper is applied evenly.  For general-purpose cleaning, sweep the floor to pick up any superficial dirt, and then scrub the floor thoroughly with trisodium phosphate (TSP). To scrub the TSP, consider using a machine powered floor scrubber with a heavy duty nylo-grit scrubber designed for aggressive concrete cleaning.Then use an industrial wet vacuum to remove all water and debris.  Mastic and caulking compounds are incredibly difficult materials to remove from concrete. Use a putty knife or floor scraper to scrape and remove as much of the sticky substances as possible. Then use a chemical concrete chemical stripper to remove whatever leftover residue remains.Apply the cleaning agent to the concrete surface, and allow it to sit for approximately 1 hour, so it has time to soak into the concrete. Then, thoroughly rinse the surface with water, and clean up the water and debris with a wet vacuum.   You can find a concrete chemical stripper at any home improvement store. Also consider using a poultice to remove mastic substances. To make a poultice, mix a fly ash or hydrated lime with denatured alcohol. This mixture makes a paste that can be added to contaminated areas.After you apply the poultice paste to the areas that have mastic residue, wait for the poultice to dry (close to an hour, maybe more depending on how thick you applied the paste), and then scrape off the now crumbling mastic debris with a putty scraper or stiff brush., It's very important to clean the floor one more time after using all the chemical cleaners, to remove any and all remaining residue. Scrub the concrete surface one more time with TSP, and then follow up once more with a thorough washing and rinsing with clean water.After the final rinsing of the concrete, again, use a wet vacuum to pick up all the remaining water and leftover particles.  Remember to use goggles, gloves and a ventilation mask while working with concrete acid stain. A activated charcoal respirator may be your best defense against fumes, especially with staining concrete in areas of poor ventilation, like basements.However, even basements should be has well ventilated as possible, using fans and open windows to circulate and draw in fresh air.   Also consider wearing a long sleeve shirt and pants, combined with knee guards, in case you have to get on your hands and knees.  The acid stain mixture contains strong chemicals and fumes, so be sure to mix the stain somewhere outside, or in an area that has adequate ventilation. Pour the mixed acid stain into a plastic pump. Usually a two-gallon pump is sufficient, but be sure that it is made completely of plastic. It is important that the applicator or spray wand is also made of plastic rather than metal, because hydrochloric acid (one of the key ingredients in the acid stain), corrodes metal very easily.For floors that have been troweled and smoothed out by hand, dilute the acid stain with a 1:4 ratio of 1 part acid stain to 4 parts water.For floors that have been troweled by a machine, (which are mostly industrial or commercial flooring), the acid stain mixture will be more concentrated, with a 1:1 ratio of one part acid stain to one part water.When mixing and diluting the acid stain, you need to pour the acid into the water rather than pouring the water into the acid. This is because acids release a lot of heat when mixed with water. The water is added to the acid so you can start with a very diluted and weak acid mixture instead of adding water to the acid, and starting with a very strong acid mixture., Always apply a test sample of stain to a small, inconspicuous area of the concrete to be treated. Because so many variables can affect the final color, that’s the only way to get an accurate preview of the finished look, and even then, the final outcome might look a bit different.  Normally, the most effective and efficient way to apply acid stain to concrete is to use a sprayer. A sprayer helps to evenly coat the concrete surface while providing quick and complete coverage. It also helps to avoid creating puddles with the stain by spraying a large area at a time rather than smaller, more concentrated areas.The spraying container you use must to be made out of plastic, and have plastic parts (like the spraying tip). That’s because the hydrochloric acid in the acid stain is highly corrosive to metal, and can cause a dangerous acidic reaction while ruining your sprayer.Start your spraying in a rear corner of the room so you can spray the entire floor and walk out of the area without walking on top the acid. Spray the acid stain with the spraying wand about a foot and a half above the ground. Consider using figure 8 patterns to spray the acid stain randomly but evenly, to thoroughly coat the floor with the stain. When you apply the acid stain, the lime deposits in the concrete are what react with the acid, giving the flooring its different coloring.Let the first coat of acid completely dry (about an hour) before adding a second coat. You can stop applying acid after the second coat, or keep adding coats until you get the coloring you want. Be very careful when walking around the stained area. Footprints from stepping in acid stain and then walking on unstained concrete can leave “burn” marks in the concrete (basically acid stains of shoe prints).Acid resistant spiked shoes (similar to soccer or golf shoes, and made with acid resistant stainless steel), are really helpful for walking around during the acid staining process, because they leave minimal shoe markings on the floor. The spikes cover less area, making foot prints a lot less visible and easier to blend into the rest of the acid stain.Don't expect color consistency or perfection. Variations are inherent in the staining process.  Wait until the chemical reaction of the acid stain is complete before you neutralize the staining. It generally takes a minimum of 3 to 4 hours after applying the acid stain for the full chemical reaction to take place. The neutralizing solution is a 4:1 ratio mixture of four parts water and one part ammonia. Spray this neutralizing mixture on the floor using a plastic pump sprayer like you did with the acid stain. After spraying the neutralizing solution, the floor will look like you are washing away the acid stain. Don't be alarmed, this is just the stain residue. The acid will have already reacted with the concrete. To scrub and properly neutralize the floor, use a broom that has stiff bristles (perhaps a broom with medium bristles - not too soft not too hard), or a slow-speed floor scrubber, and work the neutralizing solution across the entire concrete surface.You may need to perform many scrubbings to fully neutralizer the surface, especially if the acid stain used was a darker color.  Use a clean mop or a big push brush with soft bristles to wash the floor and scrub off any extra water and neutralizing agent. Then, use a shop vacuum to immediately suck up the residue from the floor before it has time to dry. After you vacuum up the water and residue with the shop vacuum, you should have a general idea of how the acid coloring will look on the concrete. Allow the floor to dry completely before you add on your sealer.At this point in the process, there’s not really a way to make touch ups to the floor. You will have an idea of how the finished floor will look, but until you add the sealer, the final product is still unpredictable.   If there is any remaining amount of moisture on the floor before the solvent-based sealer is applied, the concrete will have a cloudy haze covering the entire floor. This haze can only be removed by stripping the sealer and reapplying.One of the easiest ways to check if the floor is moist is to use blue painters tape. Try to stick the tape to the floor. If the tape sticks, the floor is thoroughly dried. If not, the floor is still moist and needs more time to dry., Apply a sealer to seal in the acid stain and add a layer of protection to your concrete flooring. Adding a sealer can also help boost the appearance of the acid stain coloring.For interior acid staining projects, film-forming sealers (sealers that provide a protective top coat on the concrete surface) are the kind most often used. However, there are several different types of these sealers, and each type has its own benefits and restrictions., These sealers include silanes, siloxanes, and silicates. These are mostly used on outdoor concrete surfaces because they provide excellent protection from harsh, outdoor weather conditions. , Acrylic sealers are used on both indoor and outdoor concrete surfaces. These types of sealers help bring out color from stained surfaces, and usually dry within an hour after application. They are available in both solvent-based and water-based formulas, but the solvent-based acrylics generally heighten color appearance better than their water-based counterparts. When acrylic sealers are used on indoor surfaces, they usually need many coats of wax (to act as a barrier), preventing scuffs from shoes and floor traffic.Acrylics normally wear faster than polyurethanes and epoxies.  Polyurethane sealers are used mostly in places like restaurants or entryways because of their durable resistance to things like shoe markings and stains. These sealers come in a wide variety of shine levels, and have a clear finish once they dry., Epoxies (which normally consist of a mixture of two highly protective compounds) form an extremely defensive coating on concrete surfaces.Since epoxies tend to yellow when exposed to UV rays, they tend to be confined to indoor concrete surfaces.   Epoxies give a long lasting, durable finish while also being extremely water resistant. However, because of their nonporous nature, epoxies can sometimes trap water and moisture within the concrete., Rather than applying one heavy coat of sealer, apply many thin coats.Sealers can be applied with either an applicator sprayer, or paint roller, but using a spray tends to be the easiest application method. If you use a sprayer, avoid spraying too much in one area and creating small pools of sealer. If you used a paint roller, push the sealer on the floor rather than pulling it. Pulling the paint roller will result in streaks across the concrete. Allow adequate drying time (normally about 1 hour) before adding addition coats of sealer. However, a second coat of the sealer must be applied within four hours of applying the first coat. After four hours of sitting time, the first coat of sealer is too hard for the second coat to bond properly.   If you use a sprayer to apply your sealer, consider using a cone-shaped spray tip rather than a fan-shaped spray tip.Allow a minimum of 4 hours before subjecting the surface to foot traffic. Within 3-4 days, the sealer will be fully dried and ready for everyday wear and tear.  To protect the sealant, it’s best to apply a wax finish on top of the concrete flooring. The easier way to apply wax to the acid stained floor is using a mop and a mop bucket. Pour the wax into a mop bucket, wring out the mop so it's not dripping with wax, and then apply the wax on the concrete in figure 8 patterns.After you apply the first coat of wax and wait about a half hour for it to dry, you can take down all the parchment paper you used to protect the bottoms of the walls.   If the masking paper pieces fall on a concrete floor that has just been sealed, hasn't had time to dry, and hasn't been waxed yet, they can stick to the floor practically like glue. However, if the pieces of parchment paper have the chance to fall on the wax coating, they can be picked up right away.Normally within an hour of applying the final wax coating, you should be able to walk on the concrete surface. However, you should wait at least 24 hours before you move any furniture onto the freshly waxed surface. The longer the wax gets to settle on the floor, the harder and more protective it becomes.Supplementary wax coats are usually applied every three to six months to ensure the finish continues to look its best.	Familiarize yourself with your concrete flooring. Familiarize yourself with the factors that can affect your acid staining. Perform a water test to check for a sealer. Modify your concrete surface if necessary. Choose your concrete cleaner. Consider using a pH-neutral cleaner. Consider using an acidic cleaner. Consider using alkaline cleaners. Mask the walls. Clean the concrete surface thoroughly. Remove caulk and mastic residue. Do a final cleaning of the floor. Put on your safety equipment. Mix the acid stain. Test a small area of concrete. Apply the acid stain to the concrete. Neutralize the applied stain. Clean up the floor. Know what kind of finish you want on your concrete. Consider using a penetrating sealer. Consider using an acrylic sealer. Consider using a polyurethane sealer. Consider using an epoxy sealer. Seal the floor. Wax the concrete surface.
Use a good hunting knife for skinning, and a gut hook knife to gut the animal.   Begin by removing the sex organs. Slice the animal from the tail to the throat. Peel back the skin with your fingers or a knife. Split the sternum, spread the rib cage and remove the organs. Flip the animal over and finish removing the hide.; , Manufacturers use a mechanical fleshing machine to remove the flesh from the inside of the skin. Running the inside of the skin over the steel roller of the machine will eliminate any excess flesh. If you don't have access to a fleshing machine, you can purchase fleshing tools from a hunting store or taxidermy supply store.   Drape the flesh over a large horizontal beam. Stand at the end of the beam and pin a small section of the hide to the end of the beam using your body weight. If you don't have a beam to use or don't want to construct one, you can simply spread the hide out on a tarp on the ground.Place a large basin or bucket below your work area to catch the excess tissue and fats as they are scraped away. Scrap away all the subcutaneous materials with your fleshing tools. Remove the veins and membrane. Rotate the hide and work until the surface is complete. Do not leave the hide if you need to take a break as the material can dry out. After the hide has been fleshed, the end result should be a white, smooth surface.  Apply a generous layer of salt to the skin, or create a brine and soak the skin.This will act as a preservative to keep the hide from decomposing. Fresh skins need to be salted or frozen within the first few hours, otherwise they may be destroyed.Fold the hide in half so the flesh sides are together. Leave for 24 hours. Scrape away any remaining salt and repeat.To create a brine, add one pound (.45kg) of salt per one gallon (3.8L) of water to create a solution. Let the hide soak for 24 hours.  Soaking will help remove any dirt or other materials from the skin. Fill a large 35 gallon (132L) or so container with fresh, cool water. Place the hide in the water for at least a day. The longer you let the hide soak, the easier it may make the hair removal process.  This can be done chemically with a solution of calcium oxide (also known as slaked lime, whitewash, or calcium hydroxide) bath. You can also use the same tools for dehairing that were used for fleshing. Remove all the hair and the epidermis, then hang the skin to dry.  Add one teaspoon (5mL) of calcium hydroxide per gallon (3.8L) of water to create limewater.This bath is known as bating and will remove any inter-fiber substances and unnecessary proteins. It will also help to soften the skin and loosen any remaining hairs. Remove the skin from the lime bath and rinse it thoroughly until clean.  This can be a one to four day process, depending on which method you choose.   Perform a vegetable tannage. A vegetable tannage uses tannin extract, which occurs naturally in a variety of different tree barks like oak, chestnut, tanoak or hemlock. The tannin extract is mixed with water and placed in a rotating drum along with the animal skin. The rotation of the drum will evenly distribute the extract over the skin. This process takes about three to four days and produces a leather that is flexible and used for furniture or luggage. Perform a mineral tannage. Mineral tannage uses a chemical called chromium sulphate. The chromium sulphate has to sufficiently soak into the animal skin to achieve proper tannage. This process takes around 24 hours to complete and produces a leather that is stretchable and used for garments and handbags. Tan a hide with brains. Brain tanning is a popular home method for tanning hides.They say each animal has enough brains to tan it's own hide. So if you have the brain of the animal use that, or you can buy a brain from your local butcher. Combine with a pint (473mL) of water and blend it until it is smooth. Use a large pot to boil the mixture. Add the boiled brains to a large bucket or drum and add some water to cool it. Keep the water at a four-one ratio to the brain. Add the hide and massage the mixture into the skin thoroughly. Leave at room temperature for up to 24 hours.  You will need a large container to hold all your hides and the tanning agent. Look for a container around 35-40 gallons (132-150L).  The tannin which you select will displace the water and replace it will collagens from the chemicals or substances. You will need to let the leather soak from several hours to 6 days depending on which tanning method you select and the size and quantity of the hides.  Dyes are what can be used to give the leather a color other than the natural look. If you are going to dye all of your leather the same color, you can add the dye during the tanning process, or you can wait until after the tanning process.  The leather will need a thorough rinse after tanning. This will ensure any chemicals and dyes are removed. Use warm water and some mild soaps that contain natural ingredients., After the skins have gone through the tannage process, they can be considered leather. Hang the leather out to dry. Hang the leather over rods in a cool, semi-moist area. You can use a fan to help speed up the drying process, but leather should dry slowly so be patient.   If the leather is not drying evenly, use some damp rags to remoisten the areas that are drying faster.  A machine called a staker can soften the leather by stretching it and lubricating it with natural oils. This process ensures the leather stays pliable.   You can also hang the hide up from your ceiling and stretch the hide as much as you can in all different directions. You can use ropes and hooks to keep the hide taut.  Once a hide is about 80% dry, apply the oil to the surface on the skin side.Coat the entire surface evenly. Repeat several times through the drying process.  The hide is soft and pliable, but depending on your purpose you may want to smoke the hide to force the tannin into the fibers. Stitch the hide to form a bag and suspend the opening above a small smoky fire for several hours.   Different kinds of wood can even add a natural color to your leather. Aspen or cottonwood can create a golden leather.Try different woods available in your area to see what different colors and looks you can create.  The leather can be buffed or polished. You might choose to treat the leather with a coat of acrylic or polyurethane to make patent leather. You can also emboss leather to create permanent shapes or designs in the fabric if desired. Finally, cut the leather based on the end user's specifications.	Remove the skin from the flesh of an animal.Skin the animal by setting it on it's back, on an incline when possible. Pull the flesh off the hide. Salt the skin. Soak the skin in water. Remove the hair from the skin. Give the skin a final lime bath. Decide on a tanning process. Load the leathers into a large drum. Add the tanning agent to the drum. Add any dyes to the container. Rinse the leather. Dry the leather. Soften the leather. Apply a leather softening oil. Smoke the hide. Apply a finish.

Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40 °F (4 °C) in order to stimulate growth.The northern states in the US as well as Canada are good places to grow rhubarb. Check your growing zone to find out if you can grow rhubarb in the climate where you live.Rhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US. Rhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75 °F (24 °C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant.; , Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.   If you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started.  Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb.You may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot.  Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants. Till your gardening bed to a depth of several feet and mix in plenty of compost, rotted manure or other organic matter to enrich the soil. This step is essential, since rhubarb needs plenty of nutrients to grow well.   You can also consider building a raised bed to plant your rhubarb and other vegetables. This way you can control the soil drainage and weed population more easily. Don't treat the area with herbicides or pesticides; rhubarb should only be planted in clean soil.Don't use chemical fertilizer to treat the soil during the first year of growth; only organic material should be used until the second or third year., Rhubarb plants can grow to become quite large, so it's important to give them plenty of space. Dig the holes in rows.  Place the roots in the holes and gently fill them in with compost-rich soil. Water the roots after planting.  Use hay and cow manure to keep weeds from growing and continue to nourish the rhubarb plants. Leaf mulch or ramial wood chips also make good mulches.  Your rhubarb bed should stay moist and well-drained throughout the heat of the summer. Water every time the soil begins to look dry.  Seed stalks keep the rest of the rhubarb plant from growing tall and strong, since they use up the plant's energy., Rhubarb isn't prone to getting many pests, but you may notice a beetle called the rhubarb curculio on the stalks. This beetle is light gray and about half an inch long. Pick off the beetles one at a time. Don't use pesticide to kill them, as this may damage your rhubarb plants., After the first year has passed, use a light application of high-nitrogen fertilizer to encourage the rhubarb to come back healthy. Do this after the ground has started to thaw.  Rhubarb needs a year to get fully established, so you'll need to wait until the second year before harvesting any stalks.  They should be 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) long.Continue harvesting throughout the summer - the season should last 8 to 10 weeks. Harvest rhubarb in late May or June by cutting the stems off with a sharp knife at soil level. It is best to harvest several times, removing a few stems from each plant each time. Harvesting the crop slowly allows the remaining stems to draw on the energy of the plant.   Always leave at least two stalks per plant so that it can store up energy for next year. This will ensure that you have a harvest next year.Harvesting season is over when the stalks start growing up thin. #*Some rhubarb plants will keep coming back for up to 20 years once established.  If you aren't going to use it immediately, store it in an airtight food storage bag in the refrigerator. It will keep this way for up to a week. You may also cut the rhubarb stalks into chunks and freeze them in a freezer-safe container for several months.  Cherry red rhubarb stalks are usually cooked in dessert dishes, since they lend a tangy, bright flavor to pies and tarts. Enjoy your garden-grown rhubarb in one of these recipes:    Rhubarb pie. This classic rhubarb dish won't disappoint. The rhubarb is cooked with sugar and strawberries for a delicious filling.  Rhubarb crumble. This is another rhubarb dessert that's quicker to make than pie, but no less satisfying.  Rhubarb cream. The flavor of rhubarb is mixed with honey and cream to make a delightful topping for any dessert.  Rhubarb ice cream. Nothing could be more delicious than ice cream made with fresh garden produce.	Determine whether you're in the right growing zone. Get rhubarb crowns to plant in the spring. Choose a planting site. Prepare the soil for planting. Dig 4–5 inch (10.2–12.7 cm) holes 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) apart. Plant the roots 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the ground. Place a layer of mulch over your rhubarb bed in the spring and fall. Keep the rhubarb watered during the summer. Remove seed stalks before they get too big. Pick off rhubarb curculio. Fertilize rhubarb every spring. Wait until the second year. Harvest stalks when they are mature. Store rhubarb in the refrigerator. Use rhubarb in a recipe.
If the motor has any of the following issues on the outside, they may be problems that can shorten the life of the motor because of previous overloading, wrong application, or both. Look for:   Broken mounting holes or feet Darkened paint in the middle of the motor (indicating excessive heat) Evidence of dirt and other foreign matter having been pulled into the motor windings through openings in the housing; , The nameplate is a metal or other durable tag or label that is riveted or otherwise affixed to the outside of motor housing called the '"stator" or "frame". Important information about the motor is on the label; without it, it will be difficult to determine its suitability to a task. Typical information found on most motors include (but not limited to):   Manufacturer's Name — the name of the company the made the motor Model and Serial Number — information that identifies your particular motor RPM — the number of revolutions the rotor makes in one minute Horsepower — how much work it can perform Wiring diagram — how to connect for different voltages, speeds and direction of rotation Voltage — voltage and phase requirements Current — amperage requirements Frame Style — physical dimensions and mounting pattern Type — describes if frame is open, drip proof, total enclosed fan cooled, etc.  Many electric motor failures are caused by bearing failures. The bearings allow the shaft or rotor assembly to turn freely and smoothly in the frame. Bearings are located at both ends of the motor which are sometimes called "bell housings" or "end bells".   There are several types of bearings used. Two popular types are brass sleeve bearings and steel ball bearings. Many have fittings for lubrication while others are permanently lubricated or "maintenance free".  To perform a cursory check of the bearings, place the motor on a solid surface and place one hand on the top of the motor, spin the shaft/rotor with the other hand. Closely watch, feel, and listen for any indication of rubbing, scraping, or unevenness of the spinning rotor. The rotor should spin quietly, freely and evenly.  A small amount of movement in and out (most household fractional horsepower types should be less than 1/8" or so) is permitted, but the closer to "none" the better. A motor that has bearing-related issues when run will be loud, overheat the bearings, and potentially fail catastrophically.  Most household appliance motors with a shorted winding will not run and will probably open the fuse or trip the circuit breaker instantly (600 volt systems are "ungrounded," so a 600 volt motor with a shorted winding may run and not trip a fuse or circuit breaker).  With an ohmmeter set to the Resistance or Ohms test setting, place test probes into the appropriate jacks, usually the "Common" and "Ohms" jacks. (Check the meter's operation manual if necessary) Choose the highest scale (R X 1000 or similar) and zero the meter by touching both probes against each other. Adjust the needle to 0 if possible. Locate a ground screw (often a green, hex head type) or any metal part of the frame (scrape away paint if needed to make good contact with metal) and press a test probe to this spot and the other test probe to each of the motor leads, one at a time. Ideally, the meter should barely move off the highest resistance indication. Make sure your hands are not touching the metal probe tips, as doing so will cause the reading to be inaccurate.   It may move a fair amount, but the meter should always indicate a resistance value in the millions of ohms (or "megohms"). Occasionally, values as low as several hundred thousand ohms (500,000 or so), *may* be acceptable, but a higher number is more desirable. Many digital meters do not offer the ability to zero, so skip the "zeroing" information above if yours is a digital meter.  Many simple "across the line" single-phase and 3-phase motors (used in household appliances and industry respectively) can be checked simply by changing the range of the ohm meter to the lowest offered (R X 1), zeroing the meter again, and measuring the resistance between the leads of the motor. In this case, consult the wiring diagram of the motor to be sure that the meter is measuring across each winding.   Expect to see a very low value of resistance in ohms. Low, single digit resistance values are expected. Make sure your hands are not touching the metal probe tips, as doing so will cause the reading to be inaccurate. Values greater than this indicate a potential problem and values significantly greater than this indicate the winding has failed opened. A motor with high resistance will not run - or not run with speed control (as is the case when a 3-phase motor winding opens while running).  Most capacitors are protected from damage by a metal cover on the exterior of the motor. The cover must be removed to access the capacitor for inspection and testing. A visual inspection might indicate oil leaking from the container, bulges in the container, or any holes in the container, burnt smell or smoke residue — all potential problems.   Electrically checking a capacitor can be done with the ohm meter. Placing the test probes on the capacitor terminals, the resistance should start low, and gradually increase as the small voltage supplied by the meter's battery gradually charges the capacitor. If it stays shorted or does not rise, there is probably an issue with the capacitor and may need to be replaced. The capacitor will have to be allowed 10 or more minutes to discharge before attempting this test again.  Some motors have centrifugal switches used to switch the start / run capacitor (or other windings) "in" and "out" of the circuit at a specific RPM. Check the switch contacts are not welded closed or are contaminated with dirt and grease that could prevent a good connection. Use a screwdriver to see if the switch mechanism and any spring can be operated freely.  A "TEFC" type motor is a "Totally Enclosed, Fan Cooled" type. The fan blades are behind metal guard on the back of the motor. Make sure it is securely fastened to the frame and is not clogged with dirt and other debris. The openings in the rear metal guard need to have full and free air movement; otherwise, the motor will overheat and eventually fail.  Check that drip-proof motors are exposed to directed water spray or moisture, and that open motors aren't exposed to any water or moisture at all.   Drip-proof motors can be installed in damp or wet locations, so long as they are installed in such a way that water (and other liquids) can not enter due to gravity and must not be subjected to a stream of water (or other liquids) directed at or in it. Open motors are, as the name implies, completely open. The ends of the motor have rather large openings and the windings in the stator windings are plainly visible. These motors should not have these openings blocked or restricted and should not be installed in wet, dirty or dusty areas. TEFC motors on the other hand, can be used in all the previously mentioned areas but must not be submerged unless designed specifically for the purpose.	Check the outside of the motor. Check the nameplate on the motor. Begin to check the bearings of the motor. Perform a check of the bearings. Next, push and pull the shaft in and out of the frame. Check the windings for short circuiting to the frame. Use an ohmmeter to check resistance value. Check that the windings are not open or blown. Check the start or run capacitor used for starting or running some motors, if equipped. Check the rear bell housing of the motor. Check the fan. Choose the right motor for the conditions in which it will be run.

You can use parafilm, a stretchable, self-clinging tape that should appear barely discernible rather than "wrapped" when attached.; , Hold the parafilm in the other hand. If wrapping on a stem of an artificial flower, begin just under the base of the flower, where the wire has been inserted.   Wind the tape first around the wire or the flower base, to create the first clinging spot. Wind once again around the same spot for firmness.  Twist the wire with your holding fingers, to help turn the wire and aid the addition of the parafilm.   Use a "stretch and pull down" action with the tape hand. Wind around once, slightly overlapping the last wind each time. You'll get the feel for it after a few tries.  At the end, wrap around twice and beneath the end, then snip off. To finish, run your fingers down the length to smooth out the tape. Done!  ,	Understand what look you're after. Hold the wire in one hand, between your thumb and index finger. Keep winding all the way down the length of the wire. Keep going until you reach the end. Finished.
There are a wide variety of virtual pianos online. Browse the internet and find a few. Make sure to spend some time messing around with a few of them so you can find one that you like and are comfortable with.   The advantage of online virtual instrument applications is that there is no need to download or install any additional software programs. To find virtual piano applications, search the Internet for "virtual piano keyboard" or "play piano online."; , The first thing you need to do is experiment a little with the virtual piano you’ve chosen. Feel free to play it a little, hit random keys, or otherwise just mess around. Remember that:   The virtual piano keys on the screen usually correspond to the keys on your computer keyboard. See if the app has a guide to your keyboard so you can find out which of your keyboard keys trigger the piano keys. If you have a touch screen, you’ll be able to just touch the screen to play. If you want, use your mouse to touch the piano and to play some notes., After experimenting a little, you should take the time to really get to know your keyboard and the specific online piano application. By doing this, you’ll be able to discover features and gain more familiarity with the app.   Notice that the keyboard is broken up into two colors, black and white. Identifying and using the black and white keys will form the basis of playing an online piano., Identifying the groups of keys will help you learn how to play the piano and eventually play whole songs. Remember that:   Black keys in groups of two are C sharp and D sharp (or D flat and E flat). The three white keys around groups of two black keys are C, D, and E. Black keys in groups of three are F sharp, G sharp, and A sharp (or G flat, A flat, and B flat). White keys around groups of three black keys are F, G, A, B, and C., Different keys are associated with different notes and make different sounds. Knowing which keys make which sounds will help you play and compose music.   Touch the white keys. The white keys represent different notes in an octave. Use the black keys. The black keys represent half steps between the notes played by white keys., After you’ve familiarized yourself with your black and white keys, you should begin playing them together. By playing them together, you’ll get a hang of the sounds the online piano creates. You’ll begin to grow more comfortable with the online piano over time.

Many people choose to donate their totaled vehicle rather than trying to sell it or claim insurance for it. Not only do you contribute to a worthy cause, but in many places, you also receive a tax deduction for your donation. Just be sure that the charity qualifies for a tax refund: in the U.S., for example, donations to certain non-profits cannot be counted toward any tax benefits.Some charities which accept car donations are the Make-A-Wish foundation, Kars4kids, and Vehicles For Veterans.If you’re not sure if the charity you’re considering has ‘exempt-status,’ contact your federal tax governing body to ascertain whether or not it qualifies.  Once you’ve decided where you want to donate your car, you can follow a simple process to hand it over to the charity. Call and arrange a pick-up time and location, or fill out a form on the charity’s website that designates an appointment.   If your car still runs, see if you can take the car to a drop-off location for the charity. This will maximize the proceeds your charity earns from your salvage vehicle, as otherwise they’ll have to pay for the towing service., In order to claim a tax deduction for your donation, you’ll need to figure out what the fair market value of your car is. Use the Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.com to come up with a figure. Just be sure to accurately reflect the condition, model, and mileage of your vehicle at the time of donation, as fibbing on this question will earn you a penalty if you get audited.Just because you’ve arrived at a fair market value for your car, you can’t deduct this figure yet. You can only do so if or when the charity sells your car for its fair market value and notifies you of this sale.  Once the charity takes your car away, you’ll need to wait until they send you the proper documentation. This written acknowledgement from the charity states whether or not the charity sold the vehicle, what improvements—if any—were made, and for how much the vehicle was sold.   If you don’t receive notification prior to the tax deadline, you can file for an extension. Alternatively, you can file your taxes without the car donation and then amend the return once you receive notification.  In the U.S., you can claim fair market value or $500 for your donated car, whichever figure is less. This is a good option if you want to use a standard 1040EZ, or if your car’s fair market value is fairly low in any case.   The charity should send you a tax receipt in the mail to help you when filling out your tax return., If you want to claim more than $500 for your donated car, you’ll need to file an itemized tax return rather than using a 1040EZ. While you will get a higher tax deduction for the car itself, though, you might ultimately get less than the standard income deduction that you’d receive if you filed the 1040EZ.For example, if you’re in the 20% tax bracket and you itemize your car donation for $2,000, you’ll get a benefit of $200. But, if you don’t have a bunch of other itemized donations to add on top of that $200, you’ll end up saving well below the standard income deduction. This guideline holds loosely for residents of the U.S., but you should check for local and federal policies no matter where you live.  Once you receive a tax receipt or bill of sale from the charity, you can fill out your tax return using this documentation. In the U.S., you’ll need to fill out Section A of IRS Form 8283 and attach it to your return, along with the written acknowledgement you received in the mail.If your car is worth more than $5,000, you’ll need to fill out Section B of IRS Form 8283, as well as get an independent appraisal of the car to verify its worth. Attach this appraisal to your return, as well as any other pictures or records which attest to its value, such as receipts for new tires or pictures of other upgrades.  Non-cash donations are one of the biggest causes for tax agency investigations, so be prepared for an audit! This is especially important if you itemized your return and claimed more than $500 for the donation. Keep copies of any documents the charity gives you, appraisals, tax receipts, and written acknowledgments from the charity.Remember that any discrepancy between what you claimed for the car and what it was actually worth or sold for will result in a penalty for you, the donor, rather than the charity.  Depending on where you live, you might need to send the relevant government agency a report of sale or other documentation. In Alaska and Hawaii, for example, you need to fill out a transfer form attached to the bottom of your vehicle title. You list the new owner as the charity and write ‘donation’ in the purchase price field.In many places, you’ll also need to remove the license plates and return them to the motor vehicle agency. In other places, such as Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Minnesota, you can leave the plates on the car.	Identify the charity to which you want to donate. Call or sign up online for a pick-up. Determine the fair market value of your car. Wait for the charity to send you a written acknowledgement of your donation. Claim a deduction of up to $500 on your 1040EZ. Itemize your tax return if you want to maximize your deduction. Attach the appropriate forms to your tax return. Save all your paperwork in case of an audit. Follow up with the motor vehicle agency.
Instead of relying on drain cleaner products, which are often corrosive and can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems,you can use household items you likely already have, such as rags, baking soda, vinegar, lemon, and boiling water.; , Take ¼ cup of baking soda, 1 cup of white vinegar, and 1 large pot of water to boil.Have a rag or sink stopper handy.  Make sure that most of the baking soda falls directly into the drain rather than around it in the sink.  You may hear a fizzing noise or see bubbles come up due to the chemical reaction. This is completely normal and should mean that the chemicals are eating away at the blockage in your sink.  Doing so will stop the bubbles from rising up and will keep the chemical reaction concentrated on the clog.  Allow the baking soda and vinegar reaction to fully work their magic here! While waiting, you should heat up the pot of water to boiling point.  This step will push down the baking soda, vinegar, and blockage. Watch as you pour in the water to see if the sink is draining any faster. If it is, but still not at its normal speed, there may still be a bit of a blockage. Try repeating the process once more if this is the case.   Prior to pouring in the boiling water, you can also squeeze in the juice of a lemon, particularly if you notice an unpleasant odor coming from the sink.Bathroom sinks are often clogged by bits of hair which can eventually rot and smell bad. This extra step will neutralize the odor and also further help break down the blockage.	Gather your materials. Measure out your ingredients. Pour the baking soda into the drain. Pour in the cup of vinegar. Plug the drain with a rag or sink stopper. Wait fifteen minutes. Pour in the pot of boiling water.
Go through your wallet, drawers, car and anywhere else that change tends to pile up to find pennies in need of cleaning. This process will work best on coins that are heavily tarnished or have a lot of stuck-on grime. The combination of vinegar and salt will cut through dirt and buildup effortlessly.Vinegar is most effective for cleaning copper. Other coins are molded from different metals, so the solution may not work as well on them. If you don’t have any vinegar on hand, a 1:1 ratio of water to acetone will produce the same effect.; , Select a dish with an opening wide enough to allow you to reach in and grab the coins. A bowl will work best, but you could also use a coffee mug or small Tupperware container. Fill the dish with enough liquid to totally submerge several pennies at once.For best results, use a pure, potent type of vinegar, such as distilled white vinegar. Make sure you select a container that isn’t made of metal. The chemical reaction created by mixing salt and vinegar can also react with other types of metals, potentially causing rust, discoloration or mild corrosion., The exact amount of salt you add is not important—just grab a little bit with two fingers and sprinkle it in. Give the salt time to totally dissolve in the vinegar before you proceed to clean the pennies.Any variety of salt will do. It’s the chemical element that’s important, not the grains themselves. Vinegar alone is not strong enough to remove the worst buildup from old pennies., Start with 4-5 pennies at a time to avoid overcrowding the dish. There should be enough room for each of the pennies to be completely immersed. Make sure the pennies stay separated at the bottom of the container.If you’re attempting to clean a large amount of pennies, you may need to empty the dish and mix up some fresh solution periodically.  The vinegar and salt duo will act fast, so there’s no need to leave them in for too long. As the pennies soak, you should be able to notice the dark colored tarnish and other gunk melting away from the copper before your very eyes.Shake the pennies at the bottom of the dish as they soak to release even more buildup. Especially dirty coins can be left to soak for up to five minutes., Remove the pennies from the solution one at a time and place them in the palm of your hand. Rub the pad of your finger over both faces of the penny to polish it. A little bit of friction will help buff away any remaining grime that the solution didn’t dissolve on its own.Go over the entire surface of the coin using smooth, circular motions. You can also lightly scour the pennies using a toothbrush or cotton swab for a more thorough cleaning., Hold the pennies under the faucet for a few seconds, or swish them through a separate dish that’s filled with water. This will help flush away any loose dirt or vinegar coating the surface of the coin. When you’re done, the pennies should shine they like’re fresh out of the mint!Once you’ve rinsed the pennies, set them aside on a layer of paper towels to dry. You may not be able to erase every last trace of discoloration on very old pennies. Eventually, other substances can set up in the metal, making them more or less permanent.  After a few minutes, the same reaction that dissolves stuck-on grime can begin to eat away at the copper. This may cause the pennies to give off an odd metallic residue, staining your hands or the container they’re in. In most cases, 30 seconds to a minute, in conjunction with some manual polishing, should be enough to do the trick.This can be especially damaging for pennies that already have a significant amount of scratching and wear.  A good rinsing is needed to flush the acetic acid from the vinegar off the pennies. If left on the copper, this can lead to a buildup of a chemical called malachite, which will turn the pennies a bluish-green color. Since your original goal was to return the pennies to their original copper color, it’s important not to skip this step.A quick wash will also help neutralize the overpowering odor of the vinegar.  Though pennies don’t actually rust, they can corrode and develop an unsightly chemical buildup when exposed to water. To keep this from occurring, pat the pennies dry with a towel after you clean them. That way, their finish will stay brighter and more vibrant for much longer.It’s okay to let the coins air dry, as long as there’s no standing water on them.  Coins can get dirty in no time at all in places like the kitchen counter or your car’s cup holders. Consider buying a coin bank that you can keep your small currency in until you cash it in or spend it. Having a central place to stash your coins will minimize their chances of contamination and prevent you from losing them.You might also use a small drawstring bag or jar, or carry it with you in a change purse. Placing your coins in a lidded container will defend them from deterioration-causing germs and moisture.	Gather together the pennies you want to clean. Pour a few ounces of vinegar into a shallow dish. Stir in a pinch of salt. Drop a few pennies into the vinegar solution. Let the pennies sit for 20-30 seconds. Scrub the pennies gently by hand. Rinse the pennies with clean water. Don’t soak the pennies for too long. Be sure to rinse thoroughly. Dry off the clean coins. Set aside a dedicated place for your change.
No Irish dancer is ever caught slouching. Your head should be held high and proud.; , You'll be in a position similar to ballet's closed 4th. Then, point your right toe outward. This closed position is what you should return to at all times. This open position should be taken when you point to begin the step.  They should be just a pinch further back than normal because of the position of your shoulders. Put your hands into fists, but be careful not to clench them -- you don't want to tense up.	Stand with your shoulders back and down. Cross your feet. Put your hands to your sides.
Use a microwave safe bowl.; , Alternatives are listed in the ingredients section. Keep mixing until there are no lumps present.   Lemon juice is not vital for consistency but is strongly recommended as it inhibits the growth of mold.  Microwave it for 15 seconds at a time, taking it out to stir in between. Depending on the power of your microwave, this should take somewhere between three and nine 15-second intervals.The mixture will form clumps as it cooks. Try to stir in as many of these as possible between microwaving. The mixture is ready when it is sticky and very clumpy. This will be easier to judge once you see how your first attempt ends up. It's better to make an undercooked batch than an overcooked one, since the former is easier to salvage.  This will prevent sticking. Feel free to prepare the work surface during the microwave intervals.  Immediately remove the hot dough-like mixture from the bowl and begin kneading it.   It will usually take 10 to 15 minutes for the mix to cool to room temperature.Knead the mix for this entire period.  Use plastic wrap to make an airtight seal around the cold porcelain mix. Store it in a cool, dry place for 24 hours.   You can coat the plastic wrap with lotion to prevent sticking. To make an easy airtight wrap, shape the mix into a log and roll the plastic wrap around it. Twist each end. The refrigerator is a fine place to store the mix, but any location out of direct sunlight, heat, and moisture is fine.  After a day of rest, remove the cold porcelain and see how it turned out. It should now be ready to use.   Take a piece of the cold porcelain and tear it apart gently. A well made batch will form teardrop shapes as it stretches and breaks.If the inside of the clay feels sticky, knead in additional corn starch. If the cold porcelain is brittle or dry, it was probably overcooked. You can try adding a little more oil, or make an undercooked batch and knead the two together afterward.	Mix together 1 cup (240 mL) cornstarch and 1 cup (240 mL) white glue. Mix in 2 Tbsp (30 mL) baby oil and 2 Tbsp (30 mL) lemon juice. Alternate 15-second intervals in the microwave with more stirring. Put lotion on your hands and a clean kneading surface. Knead the mixture until it cools down. Wrap the mix tightly and let rest 24 hours. Check consistency.
Edging can be used as a real feature in your garden if you use an unusual or eye-catching material. Think about using inverted bottles (blue ones work well) as an edging material. Remember they may break if knocked.  Blue slate or even glass beads or chips also work well. In a really small garden, marbles or mosaic may look wonderful.  Some vintage gardens even incorporate china plates into their borders. Short bamboo canes or even short lengths of steel piping stuck vertically in the ground make other eye-catching choices.       Painted stones, especially in white, can look very striking.  Some garden designers have also incorporated lighting into borders – check out some ideas in garden design books, magazines or online sites such as Pinterest for inspiration.  There are some attractive examples of garden designers using multiple materials to create lawn edging. Have a look on Pinterest for ideas.   In general, the combination of a loose material such as river stones or blue slate shale alongside a rigid material such as pressure-treated wood works well. To create a really natural effect, try to avoid using straight lines where possible. You might also like to confuse the eye by having your planting encroach on the edging in some areas so that it isn’t too neatly defined and the planting grows softly over it.	Think about using inverted bottles. Get creative with your edging materials. Consider using lighting in your edging. Experiment with using multiple edging materials.
To find warm-ups for singing, consult a local choir director or find a video on YouTube.; , Using a piano, begin on a note a fifth lower than a note at the top of your comfortable singing range. Slide your voice up a fifth and back down to your starting note. Move up a half step each time until you absolutely cannot sing the note at the top. If singing a certain note hurts, STOP. The last thing you want to do is hurt your voice. It is okay if your voice cracks, these should be notes you're not yet comfortable singing. After a couple of days doing this exercise, you should find that you can sing some higher notes than before.  Repeat the same exercise, but sliding downward and each time going progressively lower.  E.g. (breathe in) la (breathe out). ,, It makes it harder for the air to come out. ,,, It will damage your singing voice forever!  , This is a muscle near your stomach that helps you to sing. Place your hands on your lower back. When you breathe in to sing, you should feel your hands move back. A huge part of singing is breath control, and if you can properly control your breathing, it will be that much easier to sing notes you aren't yet comfortable with.	Warm up sufficiently before you start singing. Slide up to reach higher notes. Slide down to reach lower notes. When you are about to sing a note out of your range, take in a deep breath and let it all out at once while you are singing the note. If you have a naturally soft voice, try singing bolder to reach that note.  , If you have a naturally bold voice, try singing softer to reach that note.  , When you are going to sing a low note, do not ever put your head down lower to sing it!, When you are singing a note that is high, raise your eyebrows and open your mouth as wide as possible.  , Smiling makes your voice sound higher.  , Do scales every day to get your voice used to singing out of your range.  , Never push too much!, Breathe from your diaphragm.
If you have never been to your local library before, you may need to search online to figure out where the closest one is. You can just put in the word "library" and your town name in the search bar, and the local library branch should pop up.   There are even some websites that list all public libraries in a given country. If you want a list of all of the libraries in your state, go to one of these sites.; , You will need to bring in some form of official identification, such as a passport or drivers license.You may also need to prove your address, which is usually done by bringing in a piece of official mail (a utility bill for instance) that has your name and address on it.If you are too young to have an official piece of identification, then you will most likely need to go to the library with an adult who has this type of identification. You can get your own library card, but the adult will need to vouch for you. Some libraries want you to fill out a form online, and then go in to a branch to show your identification and pick up your card. This is why it is a good idea to check online about the application process before going into the library.  Bring your identification documents with you to the library. Be sure to check that the library is open before trying to go there. Some libraries are open at unexpected times, so double check online for hours and days open., Once at the library, find a person who works there to ask about library accounts. In many cases, you will want to go up to a desk that has a sign that says something like, "New Accounts."   If it is unclear where to go once you enter the library, feel free to ask any employee you see about getting a library card. At the very least, that employee should be able to steer you towards a person who can actually help you.  This should be a common request at the library, so the employee should understand what you are asking for. They will then walk you through the process and review the documents that you brought with you.  This process will vary drastically from library to library. Some libraries will ask you to fill out a form, while at others you will just give your identification to an employee and they will put your information straight into a computer.   Whatever information your library requires, such as your address or date of birth, provide it if the request seems reasonable and you are comfortable giving the information.  Depending on your specific library, you may get your card right away or it may be sent to you. When you get it, sign it to make it official. You now have access to all the amazing resources provided by your local library.   When you come to the library, remember to bring your library card so you can check items out.  If you're not used to borrowing books from the library, take out one at a time. Then, as you grow more comfortable and you return your books on time, you can get a few out at a time.   Most libraries have a limit on the number of items you can have out at one time. Ask your librarian how many items you can have out at your specific library., The librarians in your library are a really great resource for you. They can give you all kinds of information, such as recommending good books on your specific interests or helping you research topics you find interesting., The more you visit, the more enjoyable it can become. The library can be a wonderful space where you can learn new things and where you have free access to a wide variety of ideas from all over the world. They are a valuable resource that you can use any time they are open.Explore your local library. Peruse the stacks of books and learn where different types of books are housed. This may lead to you finding books on a topic you didn't even know you were interested in.	Figure out where your local library is located. Determine what type of identification you will need to bring to get a card. Visit your local library branch. Find an employee to talk to. Ask to apply for a library card.

Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot. Work up 12 chain stitches, then join the first and last chains together with a slip stitch to form a foundation ring.   Consult the "Tips" section if you need information on making slip knots, chain stitches, or slip stitches.  Chain stitch three times, then work 21 double crochets into the center of your foundation ring, completing your first round.   This first chain-three counts as one double crochet when you count your stitches. The same applies to all other initial chain-three sets made in later rounds. Including the first chain-three set, you should have 22 stitches in this round. If you do not know how to double crochet, check the “Tips” section for instructions.  Chain three, then double crochet once into the stitch at the base of your chain-three. Chain three again, skip one stitch, then double crochet twice into the stitch after that; repeat this step nine times, until you reach the end of the round.   At the end of the round, make three more chain stitches. Join the last chain of this set to the top of your beginning chain-three set with a slip stitch. Note that there should be 11 chain-three loops at the end of this step. This step also completes your second round.  Chain three, then work one double crochet into the next double crochet stitch of your previous round. Afterward, chain four, skip the next chain-three space, and double crochet once into each of the double crochet stitches after that; repeat this set of actions nine times, or until you near the end of the round.   After the last set of stitches, chain four again. Join the last chain stitch with the top of your starting chain-three using a slip stitch. This completes the round.  Chain three, then double crochet once into the next double crochet of your previous round. After that, chain five, skip the next chain-four space, and double crochet once into each of the next two double crochet stitches; repeat this set of stitches nine times.   Work five chain stitches, then join the last chain with the top of the first chain-three set of the round using a slip stitch. This completes the fourth round.  Work eight chain stitches from your hook, then single crochet once into the next double crochet of the previous round. Single crochet seven times into the next chain-five space, single crochet once into the next double crochet, chain seven stitches, and single crochet into the next double crochet; repeat this procedure a total of nine times.   Make seven single crochets into the final chain-five space. Join the last stitch to the first chain of the beginning chain-eight using a slip stitch. This completes the round.  Cut the yarn or thread, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to make a knot and tie off the lace.   Weave any remaining excess into the stitches of the lace to hide it from sight.	Crochet a foundation ring. Double crochet into the ring for your first round. Stitch and skip across your second round. Work up your third round in a similar manner. Double crochet and skip across the fourth round, as well. Single crochet the fifth and final round. Fasten off your work.
It's the best time to plant switchgrass, since it gives the roots time to get established before the temperature gets too hot. Plant as soon as the soil is workable but before the last frost. The soil temperature should be over 60 degrees when you plant.You may need to adjust the planting time to your growing region. If you live in a place where the soil is never far below 60 degrees, planting in fall or winter is fine. If you live in a place with harsh, cold winters you may need to wait until late spring to plant your switchgrass. Soil is workable with temperature over 60 degrees.  Planting seedlings instead of seeds is the easiest way to include ornamental switchgrass in your garden, since seeds are slow to germinate. To plant seedlings,   Work the soil to a depth of several feet, to accommodate the length of the taproot. Remove obstructions like rocks and other roots. Plant the seedlings 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. Lightly water the area to help the soil settle.  This is the best method for planting if you want a field of grass, rather than just a plant or two for ornamental purposes. Lightly till the soil to a depth of half an inch using a garden spade or till, then scatter the seeds over the soil. The seeds are slow to germinate.   If you’d like to try no-till planting, this seed usually does well with that method. Water the planting bed immediately after broadcasting the seeds, to help them settle. In a garden setting, thin out once the seedlings grow 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall. Leave 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between them.  After the seedlings are established, there's no need to water them. The switchgrass should get everything it needs from spring and summer rains. Once the root systems are established it will begin gaining height.   Do not fertilize switchgrass. As a native species, it doesn’t need extra fertilizer to grow healthy. Extra fertilizer can actually damage the plants. However, in very poor soil you can fertilize lightly in spring, and in very dry conditions you can water it once in awhile. Avoid treating switchgrass with pesticides or herbicides. In the case of ornamental switchgrass, no pests or weeds pose a real threat to this native species.  Over the summer it will grow quite tall, then dry out and die over the winter. In late winter, shear the switchgrass back to a few inches. The new green grass will begin sprouting as the weather warms and soon reach its adult height again.	Plant in early spring. Buy seedlings to plant. Consider broadcasting switchgrass seeds over lightly worked soil. Let the sun and rain take care of the switchgrass. Shear it back in late winter.
Even though your seedling may not need this space yet, Confederate jasmine expands rapidly, and it will need this extra room soon enough. The pot must also have several drainage holes.  Doing so prevents soil from falling through but allows water to pass out.  Use a nutrient-rich, well-draining mix, like one composed of soil, compost, and sand.  Push down on the stake until it stands against the bottom. Pack soil around it until the pole is firmly fixed in place.  Tip the seedling container onto its side and gently squeeze the plastic with one hand. With the other hand, guide or "wiggle" the jasmine out. The soil should remain intact around the roots.  Add more potting mix around it until it you bring the soil level up to where it was in its seedling container. Pack the soil around the seedling to keep it firmly in place.  Use a watering can to pour water onto the soil until the surface looks visibly damp. Pause for a minute or so after you water the soil to allow the water to settle. If the surface no longer appears damp, give the soil more water. Continue pausing and watering until the surface stays wet even after you allow the water to settle.  Stop once the top of the soil is about 2 inches (5 centimeters) below the rim of the pot.	Select a large container with a diameter between 18 and 24 inches (46 to 61 centimeters). Place coffee filters over the drainage holes. Fill 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot with a potting mix. Fix a pole, stake, or small trellis into the soil, near the side of the container. Remove the confederate jasmine from its seedling container, soil and all. Place the seedling in the pot. Saturate the soil and roots with water. Fill the pot with additional soil as the stem grows.
Be sure to leave a bit of room on either side, width wise, beyond where the bead strip will extend. This will show once you have attached the beads, which will save on wear and tear. Each strip should be a bit longer than the belt will be, since you still need to attach the buckle. These strips will be sewn on top of each other to make the belt thick enough. , It should begin right after where you want the hole, and end right before the buckle.  This will be easiest with a needle made for sewing leather, though quilting needles may work if you don't have a leather needle. ,, The usual shape is probably easiest. Make sure you have the two sides lined up well, and pinned together, before you cut.  You can either use a straight row of stitches just above where the bead strip, or wrap the stitches over and around the edge of the belt, depending on the look you want. Use contrasting thread for a different look. ,	Cut 2 strips of equal size to the width you wish you belt to be. Attach the buckle to one strip according to the directions.  , Line the bead strip up on the strip with the buckle attached. Sew along the edges of the strip with clear beading thread to attach it. Line the bottom strip up under the top one.  , Mark where you want your hole.  , How you shape the end is up to you. Sew along the edges of the two strips to attach them together.Punch a hole  , All done, you now have a beaded belt!
Bougainvillea thrives in places that are hot and relatively dry. If you want to keep bougainvillea outdoors all year long, it's best to be in hardiness zone 9 or higher. If you're in a colder, wetter zone, you can still grow bougainvillea if you plant it in a pot and bring it indoors for the winter.   Bougainvillea do best when night temperature don't drop below 60 °F (16 °C) and daytime temperatures don't exceed 100 °F (38 °C). Bougainvillea can be wintered over in the basement or another low light area.; , Bougainvillea is a sun-lover and it will grow best in a full sun position, in the open, facing due North (in the southern hemisphere) and due South (in the northern hemisphere). Bougainvillea needs at least 5 hours of full sun every day to thrive.  Bougainvillea won't do well in soil that retains too much water, so make sure the soil drains quite well. They need rich soil that is slightly acidic, with pH between 5.5 and 6.0.          Add limestone to the soil to increase the pH or sulphur to decrease the pH as necessary. If you're planting the bougainvillea in a pot, choose a soil mix with the appropriate pH level.  Dig a hole as deep as the bougainvillea plant's root ball. Add a high-phosphate fertilizer to the hole to promote root growth and help the flowers bloom. Lift the bougainvillea plant from its container and wet the root ball into the hole. Lightly pat the soil around the base of the plant.   If you want the bougainvillea to climb a trellis or wall, be sure to plant it near the structure. As it grows, you'll need to "train" it to climb the structure by wrapping it gently around the base. If you're planting the bougainvillea in a container, make sure to choose one with plenty of drainage holes, since bougainvillea hate to have "wet feet."	Decide whether to plant in the ground or in a pot. Find a sunny spot in your yard. Choose a place with rich, well-drained soil. Plant the bougainvillea.
Although you can harvest tarragon throughout its growing season, the best time to harvest is in the late summer.This is when the plant’s aroma and flavor are at their fullest. At this point, you should pick a large quantity and preserve some leaves for later use.Do not cut off the entire stock. Just remove the fresh lighter green leaves. Be sure not to harvest more than one-third of the leaves from your plant. Harvesting too many leaves may weaken or kill it.  After you have harvested the leaves, tie the tarragon into loose bundles and hang them out to dry in a warm, arid, airy place. There needs to be enough air circulation to ensure that the leaves properly dry. It is also important that the leaves dry quickly. Otherwise, they may mold and get discolored, which will ruin them.If stored in a cool, dark cupboard, your dried tarragon should last one to three years. You can also dry tarragon in a vegetable dehydrator or in an oven on its lowest heat setting.  Once you have harvested your tarragon, rinse the leaves and chop them up. Then, place the diced herbs on a tray in the freezer. Once they are completely frozen, place tarragon in freezer bags and seal. After they are thawed out, the herbs can be used as a seasoning.Once frozen, your tarragon should keep its flavor for several months. Do not use thawed tarragon as a garnish. The frozen leaves will still hold their flavor, but the texture will be dry and crunchy.	Gather your tarragon leaves. Dry the leaves. Freeze the harvested leaves.
Set the backing and glass aside; you will not need them for this project. You can also use a back-less frame instead.   If you were able to find a framed screen meant for paper making, you can skip this section and start making the paper pulp.; , Measure the entire frame, including the outside edges. Cut a piece of window screening down to fit those measurements. If you can't find window screening, you can use another type of stiff, mesh screening.   Do not use tulle or mesh fabric. It is too soft. The mesh must be finely woven. If the holes are too big, the paper will fall through.  Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you. Place the screen on top of the frame. Secure it with nails, tacks, or stables. Trim off any excess screening.Consider wrapping duct tape around the back edges of the frame. This will prevent the screen's sharp edges from accidentally scratching you.  This will help soak up any excess water. Make sure it's one you don't mind possibly ruining. Sometimes, paper can leak out dyes.  Make sure that the screen side (the back part) of the frame is facing down. You want to front of the frame to form a rim around your screen.  Choose plain, non-glossy paper, such as printer paper, construction paper, newsprint, and paper napkins.Tear the paper into ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) scraps. How much paper you use depends on how many cards you want to make.  Place the shredded paper into a mixing bowl. Cover the paper with boiled water. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then give it a stir.If you don't have colored paper, but want to make it colored, stir in a few drops of food coloring into the water first., Pour the entire mixture, including the water, into a blender. Pulse the blender until the paper turns into a pulp. Pour out any excess water.   If you don't own a blender, you can use a food processor instead. Don't over-blend the paper. You want there to be a few chunks., Pour the pulp back into the mixing bowl. Stir a few spoonfuls of your favorite type of seed. Choose seeds that are small and flat, such as: forget-me-not, poppy, or herbs.Other great seed choices to consider include carrots, radishes, and wildflowers., Use your fingers to spread the paper around into a rough rectangular shape. If you wish to make shaped cards, such as hearts, place a cookie cutter on the screen first, then fill it with about 1 tablespoon of the pulp., If you used cookie cutters, make sure that you smooth the pulp until it fills the entire bottom of the cookie cutter.How thick you make the paper is up to you. Keep in mind that the thicker it is, the longer it will take to dry.  If you used a cookie cutter, wrap a towel around your finger first, then gently press the pulp inside the cookie cutter. Once you have most of the water drained, remove the cookie cutter.   If the towel under the screen becomes too soggy, replace it with a fresh one. If the baking dish becomes filled with water, dump the water out, and replace the towel. If you plan on making more shaped cards, now is the time to do so. Leave some space between each "card."  , Take the screen out of the baking dish; leave the towel behind. Set it down on a wire cooling rack, a couple of blocks, or a clothes drying rack. Make sure that air can flow freely under the screen., Make sure that air can flow under the rack.  If the underside is still damp, flip the paper over, and let it finish drying. Your paper is now ready to turn into beautiful cards.  This will make the base for your card. Choose a color that works well with you paper. You can also use a blank card, with nothing written or printed on it.  The seeded paper you just made will eventually go on the front of your card. If you make a rectangular sheet of paper, you can cut it down into smaller shapes using a pair of scissors. If you made shaped paper using a cookie cutter, or if the paper is smaller than your card, leave it as it is.   Save the scraps and plant them in you garden!  , Do not get carried away; you want the paper to be easily removable so that the recipient can pull it off and use it. A few drops of glue are all that you need. You can also outline the seeded paper with a glue stick instead; glue sticks are much easier to remove than regular glue.  These cards look best if they are left simple, but you can add some designs, if you wish. For example, you could draw designs or write messages onto the seeded paper or cardstock using a pen. You can also stamp a design onto the seeded paper instead using a rubber stamp and ink.  Cut down a sheet of thin paper, such as printer paper, so that it is a little smaller than you card. Place a strip of double-sided tape along the top, narrow edge. Open your card, and set the sheet down on the right side. Make sure that it is centered, then set the card aside.   If you don't have double-sided tape, you can use a glue stick instead. This not absolutely necessary, but it will give your card a fancier touch. This would be a good idea if your cardstock is a bright color.  Be sure to include planting instructions for your card.Listed below are general instructions. Keep in mind that you may need to include additional instructions based on the type of seed you used:Pull the seeded paper off of the card and tear it into smaller pieces. Plant the scraps under ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) of soil. Water the soil generously. Allow the excess water to drain. Keep the paper moist until the seeds sprout. Once the seeds sprout, water them only as needed.	Remove the glass and back from a picture frame. Cut a piece of window screen down to fit the frame. Secure the screen to the back of your frame. Place an old towel into a shallow pan or tray. Set the frame on top of the towel. Tear your paper into small pieces. Soak the paper in boiled water for 10 to 15 minutes. Blend the paper until it turns into a pulp. Stir in the seeds. Pour the paper pulp over the screen. Use your fingers to smooth the paper out. Press the pulp with a towel or sponge to remove excess moisture. Transfer the screen to a well-ventilated area. Allow the paper to air dry for 24 hours.You can help speed up the process by putting the screen near a heat source, such as a heater or sunny window. Carefully peel the paper off of the screen. Fold a sheet of cardstock in half widthwise. Cut or trim the handmade seeded paper down. Glue the seeded paper to the front of your card. Consider decorating the front of your card further. Consider adding a sheet of plain paper inside the card to write a message on. Write your message inside the card.
You can also make your backpack out of cotton or linen, but it may not be as durable. To make things easier later on, consider labeling the pieces with some dressmaker's chalk. Here are the pieces you need to cut:Body: two 44 by 50-centimeter (17.32 by 19.69-inch) rectangles Base: one 17 by 36-centimeter (6.7 by 14.18-inch) rectangle Flap: two 24 by 24-centimeter (9.45 by 9.45-inch) squares Shoulder straps: two 10 by 66-centimeter (3.94 by 25.99-inch) strips Handle strap: one 10 by 24-centimeter (3.94 by 9.45-inch) strip  , Pin the two flap pieces together, with the right sides facing in. Use a glass and a pen to draw the curves first, then cut them out with a pair of scissors., Sew along both of the side edges and the curved, bottom edge. Leave the top, straight edge open, so that you can turn the flap inside out.  Cut little notches into the curved edges. Be careful not to cut into the stitching. This will help reduce bunching and bulk when you turn the flap inside-out.  After you turn the flap inside out, use something thin and slender, like a pair of scissors, a chopstick, or a knitting needle, to push out the curves. Press the edges of the flap down with an iron using a heat setting suitable for the fabric. When you are done, topstitch all the way around the flap, about 6 millimeters (0.24 inches) from the edge.You can use a matching thread color, or a contrasting one.  For a fancier touch, pin some bias tape all the way around the edges, then top stitch it down. You can topstitch the top, raw edge this time around, if you want to.  Turn the strips so that the wrong sides are facing you. Fold and press each of the long edges by 1 centimeter (0.4 inch). Do this for both of the shoulder straps and the handle strap.Leave the narrow edges alone., Fold each of the strips in half, lengthwise. The folded edges should now be on the inside, and the right-side of the fabric should now be on the outside. Pin the edges in place, then topstitch along them, about 6 millimeters (0.24 inch) away from the edge. Do this for both of the shoulder strap pieces and the handle strap., Pin the two body pieces together, with the right sides facing each other. Starting from the top-left corner, stitch down 5 centimeters (1.97 inches) along the long edge. Leave a 3-centimeter (1.19-inch) long gap, then continue sewing the rest of the way down to the bottom corner. Repeat for the right side.Use a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance. Do not sew along the bottom edge of the bag.  An easy way to do this is to turn the body piece inside out, and turn it so that one of the seams is on the ironing board. Run the iron through the tube, pressing the seam allowances open and flat. Repeat this for the other seam allowance, then turn the back inside out again so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you., Fold and press the top edge of the bag down by 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) first. Then, fold it down by 4 centimeters (1.58 inches), and press it again.Make sure that you are folding evenly all the way around the top edge of the bag., Sew as close to the bottom edge as you can—about 6 millimeters (0.24 inch). seam allowance. Use a color that matches your fabric; for a more interesting design, use a contrasting color. When you are done, turn the back inside out, so that all of the seams are on the inside, and the right side of the fabric is facing you., Make sure that the bag is turned inside-out first, so that the right side of the fabric is facing you. Then:  Pin the shoulder straps 13 centimeters (5.12 inches) apart, just below the casing. The top edges should be facing top of the bag, and the bottom edges should be facing the bottom of the bag. Pin the ends of the handle strap between the shoulder straps. The ends of the handle should be facing the top of the bag, and the loop of the handle should be facing the bottom of the bag.  Position the flap so that the top, raw edge is just below the casing, and aligned with the raw edges of the straps. The raw edge should facing the top of the bag, and the curved edge should be facing the bottom of the bag., Use a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance both times., Make sure that you are only pinning them to the back of the bag. Do not pin them through both layers of fabric, or you won't be able to attach the base., Fold the base into fourths. Use a glass to trace a curve on top of the loose (not folded) corner. Cut along the line that you drew, then unfold the base. You'll get a rounded rectangle., Turn the bag inside-out so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you. Pin the base to the bottom of the bag. The long edges of the base should be at the front/back of the bag. The short edges of the base should be at the sides of the bag. Stitch the base in place using a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance., Attach a safety pin to one of the 1-meter (1.1-yard) long cords. Starting from the front-left hole, pull the cord all the way through the front and back casing, until it comes out the back-left hole. Repeat this step with the other cord, but for the other side; start at the front-right side, and finish at the back-right side.  The bag will close at the left and right sides, like a drawstring bag or pouch.  Take both of the cords on the left side of the bag, and knot the ends together. Repeat with the two cords on the right side of the bag., Go over your bag, and snip off any loose or excess threads. Your bag is done, and ready to use!  If you want, you can attach a snap to the flap and front of the bag. Follow the instructions that come with the snap you are using, as each one will be a little different.	Cut your pieces out of durable fabric, such as canvas. Round the corners of the flap pieces. Sew the two flap pieces together using a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance. Turn the flap right-side-out, press it flat with an iron, then topstitch the edges. Fold the edges of the shoulder and handle strips in by 1 centimeter (0.4 inch), then press them flat with an iron. Fold, press, and topstitch the shoulder and handle straps. Pin and sew the body pieces together, leaving a 3-centimeter (1.19-inch) gap on each side for the cording. Press the seam allowances open. Fold the top edge of the bag down twice to make the casing. Topstitch along the bottom edge of the casing, then turn the bag inside out. Pin the shoulder straps and the handle strap to the top of the bag. Pin the flap on top of the shoulder and handle straps. Stitch the flap in place, then fold flap upwards, and topstitch it again. Pin the ends of the shoulder straps to the bottom of the bag, 18 centimeters (7.09 inches) apart. Cut the corners of the base piece so that you get a rounded rectangle. Turn the back inside-out again, then pin the base to the bottom, and sew it in place. Thread the cords through the casing. Knot the ends of the cords together. Snip off any loose threads.
Work first 2 double stitch, 1 purl, repeat 9 times, join the stitch into a circle.; , This should consist of 3 double, 5 purl, divided each by 2 double stitches, 4 double.  Repeat 8 times more, only each following circle must be fastened on to a purl of the preceding circle after 3 double stitches. Having completed each circle, the thread must be drawn through the purl of the first circle, which forms the centre of the rosette. , For the tatted border, make at short distances 1 loop with 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double. After having worked a sufficient number of such loops, wind another thread round the thread between the loops, turning always 1 loop on the right side and 1 on the left.  Make for each of these a foundation chain of 12 stitches, crochet back over this chain 2 double in the last stitch but one, 1 double in the next stitch, 1 treble in each of the following 7 chain, 2 treble in the next stitch, 2 treble, 1 long treble, and 2 treble in the next following stitch of the foundation chain.  Then 3 double in the point of the leaf thus formed.  Always work 2 double in each stitch of the preceding row, and 3 in the long treble stitch. In working this last round, the circles must be joined to the leaves by taking up the purl stitch of the circle before casting off the corresponding double stitch of the leaf.  This joins the 2 rows of circles and leaves with a row of chain stitches, on which a row of double is worked.  Make a row of chain stitches, joining leaves and circles together. Then work 3 rows of treble, work 3 more rows over the tatted border:    First row: entirely in chain stitches. After every fourth stitch take up the purl of the loops on one side.  Second row: 1 treble in the middle stitch of the 3 chain, 2 treble, divided by 3 chain.  Third row: 1 treble, 1 chain, miss 1 under the last. In the last row the leaves and circles must be fastened on the border, as seen in illustration.	Begin each of the rosettes or circles in the centre. Work at a small distance a smaller ring. Draw the cotton through the purl of the first circle. Knot the beginning and the end of the thread together.  , Create the border. Begin the crochet part with the leaves. Work on the other side of the chain the same pattern, only the reverse way. Edge the whole leaf with a round of double stitches. Work the stem. Create the border which forms the upper edge.
Cut flowers may look great in a vase in your kitchen but inevitably, bacteria in the water and on the surface of the flowers will clog up the stems. You will need to re-cut the stems to remove the clogged portions of the stem and prevent the flowers from wilting and dying. Use garden shears, pruners, or a sharp knife to make a clean cut at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure the cuts are clean and smooth.Cut about 1 inch of the stems, making sure that are the flowers are relatively even in length, as this will ensure they all perk up at the same time.; , Do this as soon as the stems have been cut to prevent air bubbles from becoming trapped in the stems. The air bubbles can block the flow of water up the stems and lead to wilted, dying flowers.Though some florists advocate for the use of cold water or warm water, lukewarm water will help to revive the flowers just as well. Warm water can bring moisture to the flowers faster, but may shock the flowers and lead to wilting. The exceptions to this rule are bulbs like tulips and hyacinths. These flowers prefer cold water.  Leaves that sit in the water or fall into the water can foul up the water as they rot and deteriorate. Only remove leaves that sit below the water line in the vase of water as higher leaves can help to pump water to the stems.You should also remove any other debris that is sitting in the water, such as fallen petals or bugs. This debris can introduce bacteria into the water that can cause the flowers to wilt.  The cooler and darker the environment around your flowers, the longer they will live. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight. Look for a spot in your home that is cool in temperature and does not get a lot of light.The exception to this rule is sunflowers, which often need more light than other cut flowers. You should also keep the flowers away from ripening fruit, such as bananas. Ripening fruit give off a gas called ethylene, which can significantly shorten the lifespan of your flowers., Keep your flowers looking fresh by replacing the flower water with fresh water every three days. The rule is, if you wouldn’t drink the vase water yourself, it probably isn’t clean enough for your flowers.If there seems to be a lot of gunk and debris in the flower vase, you may want to quickly rinse out the flower vase before replacing the water and putting the flowers back in the vase. A clean vase will prevent bacteria from infecting your flowers.	Cut one inch off the stems at an angle. Place the cut stems in fresh, lukewarm water. Remove any leaves below the water line. Keep the flowers in a cool, dark spot. Replace the flower water every three days.
Before you can begin determining the price you want, you need to figure out what you can reasonably afford. Figure out how much you're willing to spend given your current income and expenses.If you intend to take out a loan, or make payments on the car over time, figure out reasonable month-to-month payments. Look into your current income as well as your current expenses. How much money could you afford to putting towards payments on a used car or on a loan? How much would a car cost, total, with these loan payments in mind? Weigh in other costs as well. In addition to payments on the car itself, you'll have to think about cost of registration, taxes, title, and insurance. This will tack on about $1,500 to $3,000 to the total costs. You may also want to invest in a warranty plan through the dealer, which will add some costs as well. You'll also have regular costs associated with the car, like repairs, gas, parking, oil changes, and maintenance.; , Once you've weighed in what you can reasonably afford, create a target price for yourself. It can help to consult online price guides. Such guides will give you a range of prices for used cars, helping you determine what a reasonable price range is for your needs. Online guides typically include the manufacturer's price for a variety of types of cars, as well as the typical selling price for the car.When looking for cars, avoid cars that are on the high end of your chosen price range. During negotiation, you may end up paying slightly higher., You can fund the purchase of a used car by selling your old car. Figure out about how much you can get for your current car before you begin looking for a new one.Not having a car to trade in will not affect your ability to get a good deal on a used car. In fact, many experts recommend that you treat the sale of your current car and purchase of a new one as separate transactions. This will help you get the most for your money.   There are many online outlets that allow you to gauge your car's value, such as Kelly's Blue Book or NADA Guides. You'll have to enter a variety of information into such sites, such as your car's year, make, and current condition. Be honest about your car's condition. The more honest you are, the more accurate of an estimate you'll receive. Keep in mind you may make more money selling your car privately, especially if it's in good conditions. However, this can take a lot of time. If you're looking to sell fast, it's a good idea to shop your car around to several dealerships in the area and take the best offer. You should also look online at car listings sites like Cars.com or eBay Motors to get a sense of what kind of offer to hope for. Make sure to look for your car's specific model, year, and features to get the closest approximation of what a good offer would be.  Once you have a sense of what kind of budget is reasonable for you, figure out the type of car you want. This will help you find the right seller, and get a better sense of what you can expect to pay. Consider things like size, mileage, and safety when thinking about the car you want.You can use websites like Kelly's Blue Book to look at a variety of types of cars. In addition to the car's build, pay attention to things like the year. Cars from a certain year may have special features that better suit your needs. You should also pay attention to marks of quality regarding your chosen car type. Assess whether or not the vehicle is in good shape by getting a vehicle history report (as described in the part of the article titled "researching the car"). This information will be helpful to you during the buying process, as you'll be able to better tell if you're getting a good deal on a car. Getting a vehicle history report is a crucial step in determining whether or not the car you want is in good condition. However, before doing that you should also give the car a visual inspection for damage or obvious signs of poor maintenance. For example, look for chipped or stained paint, cracked or over-worn tires, body damage, corroded battery leads, damage to the engine, strong odors, signs of water damage, rust, and proper engine fluid levels. Any of these can be signs of previous accidents or poor maintenance. You should also run the climate control systems in the car and give it a test drive. If you find any major flaws with the car like signs of water damage or oil leaks, move on to another vehicle.  Once you have a sense of what you want, begin looking for an outlet. Look for a dealer that offers the type of car you want, at prices affordable for you.You can use an online search tool, where you can narrow down your search by entering information like type of car and your price range. You can also browse the local yellow pages. You can visit a few dealerships, checking the typical prices for their cars. Read reviews before settling on a dealership. You want to make sure any company you work with has a good reputation. Websites like Yelp will provide a variety of reviews. Remember, one or two bad reviews among many solid reviews may be a fluke. However, an onslaught of negative reviews is probably a bad sign.  In addition to dealers, you can also purchase used cars from individuals. This method comes with a bit more risk, but is also where you can get a really great deal. Browse car listings websites, the newspaper, and look around town for used cars for sale. If you can find a car owner looking to make a quick sale, you can usually talk them down further than you could a dealer.   When purchasing from an individual, you have to be cautious. Make sure to ask for a vehicle history report that includes its accident history and maintenance. You should also take the vehicle for a test drive before buying. When paying for the new car, your best option is to use cash. This will be the most secure method for both you and the seller.  The vehicle identification number (VIN) is a small number usually found on the lower lefthand side of a car's front wind shield. Before purchasing a used car, you want to make sure you examine the VIN. If it looks like it has been tampered with, the car may have been stolen. Checking the VIN is a good way to weed out scams., Once you've settled on a dealership and obtained the VIN for the vehicle, make sure you assess a car's condition. You should obtain a history report for the car to make sure it was in good condition prior to purchase.Ask the dealer for the car's vehicle identification number (VIN). For a small fee, you can run a car's VIN through a website, such as vehiclehistory.com or CARFAX, for a report on a car's history. You do not want to purchase a car that has had multiple maintenance issues in the past. You should also request the dealer provide you with a vehicle history report. A solid dealer will not hesitate to provide the report. Look the report over for any major red flags. You do not want to buy a car with a history of breaking down, or one that's gone through multiple owners.  You should always take a driving test before purchasing a used car. You want to make sure the car drives smoothly and that you like the feel of the vehicle. You do not want to purchase a car you are uncomfortable driving.Make sure you take a long driving test. A few minutes is not long enough to assess whether a car is a good fit for you. Pay attention to seat comfort. Do you feel comfortable in this car? Does the seat work for you? Also, think about how the car drives. Do you feel comfortable handling the steering wheel? Remember, you'll be driving this car for awhile. You want to make sure you're comfortable in it. You should also check to make sure the car works. Check things like the CD jack, the interior lights, the stereo, and other aspects of the car's interior.  If you're interested in the car after driving it, you should have it inspected. You can take the car to your regular mechanic and have him or her look it over to make sure it's in good condition. Unfortunately, not every dealership will allow a pre-purchase inspection. However, if you're insistent on wanting the inspection conducted, a dealer may allow it if he or she believes it'll increase the chances of a sale., If everything checks out, you'll want to make an offer on the car. Before doing so, do so more research. Once again, use sites like Kelly's Blue Book and AutoTempest to figure out the average market price for the car you're considering. You can use these pricing guides during negotiation. You'll be able to tell when the dealer is requesting an unreasonably high price for the car., When you begin the negotiating process, have the seller start. If the salesperson names the first price, you can work down from there. The opening price is what will define the negotiation, and you do not want to give the seller the chance to push your price range up.Start off the negotiation by asking, "What are you selling the car for?" Once the seller names the price, you'll be able to bargain down. Usually, the first price named will be a couple of thousand dollars below the advertised price.  You want to make sure, during negotiations, that the salesperson knows you've done your homework. A salesperson will be more willing to negotiate if he knows that you're aware of the average costs of the car you're considering buying. Mention you've looked at a website like Edmund's or Kelly's Blue Book, and mention the prices listed on those sites. You're unlikely to get a price in the exact range you want, but the salesperson will be willing to go lower if they know they're working with an informed customer., Do not be hesitant to keep negotiating. A salesperson's money is often made on commission. It's in the salesperson's best interest to eventually make a sale. Keep pushing to go lower until you get a price in your range.You usually negotiate in a cubicle. Take opportunities to occasionally leave the cubicle during the negotiation process. This conveys to the salesperson that you will not be controlled, and that you're independent enough to take breaks and walk out of negotiations. Do not be afraid to let the negotiation go overnight. If you're not getting the price you want, say you'll come back tomorrow to discuss. After some time has passed, the salesperson may be willing to go lower. Salespeople want to sell as many cars as possible, so it's in their interest not to have a potential buyer walk away.  Once you've reached a price you're comfortable with, you can close the deal and walk away with your car. You'll usually pay with cash or check, and should make sure you get the car insured before driving away. Review all documents thoroughly before signing to assure you're getting the deal you want and that there are no hidden costs.It may be a good idea to take a day to review the documents. If you're unfamiliar reading legal papers, see if you can get a lawyer to review the documents for a small fee.	Figure out what you can afford. Create a target price. Determine your current car's trade-in value. Decide on a type of car to match your needs. Research local used car sales outlets. Buy a car from an individual. Check the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Get a history report on the car. Take a driving test. Have the car inspected if possible. Research the average market price for the car. Have the seller name the first price. Mention you looked at a reputable pricing guide. Negotiate until you reach the right deal. Close the sale.
All of these recipes can be modified to accommodate children with allergies.   Use a non-dairy spread instead of margarine.Use rice flour instead of conventional flour to accommodate wheat/gluten allergies or sensitivities., You can add additional ingredients to change the texture of play dough. Note that eating many of these ingredients may cause upset stomachs, and it would be best to avoid letting children ingest play dough containing these texture additives.   Add one cup of hair conditioner to make the play dough soft and silky.Add 1/4 cup of clean sand to make the play dough more moldable and easy to sculpt., Another simple modification to any of these recipes involves scenting the dough. Be aware, as with the texture modifications, that certain scent additives may cause upset stomachs and render the dough inedible.   Add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 50 ml of chocolate essence to make chocolate-scented play dough.Add 50 ml of vanilla essence to make vanilla-scented play dough.Add 1/4 cup of blackberry jam and 125 grams of crushed blackberries to make blackberry play dough.Add 50 ml of strawberry essence to make strawberry-scented play dough.Add 50 ml of peppermint essence to a red or green batch of dough to make candy cane-scented play dough.	Make play dough allergy-friendly. Change the texture. Add a scent.
Rather than buying a floral headband, making your own is quick, easy, and inexpensive. For this DIY project, you will need:1/2” thick elastic (can be found at any craft store)  An elastic headband can be used if you already own one   Fake flowers (can be found at any craft store) Hot glue gun (E6000 or super glue can also be used)Scissors; , Wrap the elastic around the top of your head. Once you find the right length, hold the spot with your fingers. Unwrap the elastic from your head and use scissors to cut the elastic at the spot marked by your fingers.         If you already have your own headband, you can skip this step. The headband can be any color you like; both dark- and light-colored headbands look nice.  Use your glue gun (or other type of glue) to dab some glue on one end of your elastic. Bring the other end of the elastic to the dab of glue, and place it on top of the glue.Press the two ends together for about 10 seconds. When the glue is dried, you have your headband.          Be sure that the elastic isn’t twisted when you connect the ends with glue. It will make the flowers twist and be uneven when you glue them on.  Pull the artificial flowers off the stems. You should easily be able to pluck them off the stems. At the bottom of the flower, there will be a small, green stem (used to hold the flowers to the longer stems). Cut off the smaller stem under the flower so the bottoms of the flowers are flat.         You can either leave the flowers whole, as they are, or pull the flowers apart to expose the different layers of petals.  If you leave the flowers as they are (whole), apply glue onto the back of the flower using the hot glue gun.Then place the flower onto the headband and hold it in place for about 10 seconds. If you pulled the flowers apart to expose the layers of petals, it may be easier to place a small dot of glue on the headband, and then stick the petal layer onto the glue.Press and hold the petal layer down for about 10 seconds. Space the flowers out as evenly as you want. Continue to add flowers to the headband until you are satisfied with the headband.          If you are using any glue other than a glue gun, consider first applying glue to the flower, then placing it on the headband.It will create less mess.  If you used a hot glue gun to attach the flowers to your headband, your headband will be completely dry after about 30 minutes. If you used E6000 or super glue, let the headband dry for at least a day so nothing falls off when you try to wear it.	Gather your supplies. Measure the length of your headband. Form your headband. Take apart the flowers. Glue the flowers to your headband. Allow the headband to dry.
Do you want to write a pop song, a country song or even a classical song? Take some time to listen to a few examples of whichever you choose to get a feel for them.   Take note of the rhythms and structure of other songs of the type you choose. Your notes will help you stay on the right track. Choose the type of song you’d like to listen to. It will keep you motivated.; , Take a few minutes to meditate about the things that are important to you. You may want to write a love song for your sweetie or a song about a historical event. Make sure your topic is something you personally connect with. Give your song an emotional core.  How do you want your audience to feel when they listen to your song? Your tone will affect the way you write the song. A song about a new love would likely be upbeat and happy, while a song about the death of a loved one would likely be slow and somber.   Elton John’s emotional tribute to Marilyn Monroe, “Candle in the Wind,” is a perfect example of a song with a powerful somber tone. Over twenty years after he wrote the song, John would play it beautifully at the funeral of Princess Diana.Bruno Mars’ “Amazing,” about the joy of being in love, is a perfect example of a song with an effective upbeat and happy tone. Think about your feelings toward the subject of your song and choose a mood that will communicate it to the audience.  Always keep your eyes and ears open for possible titles. You never know where you might find a great one. Skim newspapers. Read books. Have conversations. The perfect title could reveal itself to you in the unlikeliest of places.Another great way to find a title is to make a metaphor for your topic. If your title comes from a conversation with someone else, be sure to ask that person permission before you use it.  Play around on your piano for a while and try to find a tune that fits your mood. Try to feel the the emotion you wish to invoke while you play. If it’s a happy song, let your fingers be light and bouncy. If it’s a sad song, slow everything down and take time to let the notes resonate.   You can even hum your melody first and then try to find the corresponding keys on the piano. Keep it simple and catchy for now. You’ll build on it later.  You can download blank staff paper off the internet or buy it at almost any music store. If you prefer, you can even create your own. Make two rows of five straight lines, one on top of the other with some space in between. Then split each row into four columns to make the measures.   Be sure to use a ruler so that you get clear straight lines.  A time signature notifies you how a song will be counted. You’ll see it written like a fraction at the beginning of any piece of music. “Common” time means that the song has a signature of 4/4. The top number means that you’ll have 4 beats in a measure. The bottom number means that you’ll count each beat as a quarter note. In common time, there a few different types of notes that have varying values.A half note has the value of two quarter notes or two beats. A whole note has the value of four quarter notes or four beats. An eighth note has the value of one half of a quarter note. A dot immediately following a note increases that note by half its value. A half note would then last for three beats.  The key is basically the arrangements of sharps and flats in your song.If you have no sharps or flats in your scale, you will be in the key of C major. For every fifth you move up from C, you add a sharp (black key above a note) to your scale. If you move from the key of C to the key of G, you would add an F sharp. For every fifth you move down from C, you add a flat to your scale. So if you dropped from the key of C to the key of F, you would add a B flat. This system is called the circle of fifths.   The order in which sharps are added is F,C,G,D,A,E,B. The order in which flats are added is reversed, B,E,A,D,G,C,F. Minor keys have a darker tone and follow the same rules. The key of A minor has no sharps or flats and you can move up or down from there.  A good chord progression for your song will give it rhythm. There are few different chord progressions you can follow. One of the most popular is the Nashville progression. To use the Nashville progression, you’ll have to find your root chord, (the same as your key) your dominant chord, (the fifth chord above your root) your sub-dominant chord (the fourth chord above your root) and the six chord (this will be a minor chord).This may sound confusing but it’s actually pretty easy. If you’re in the key of C, you would count a fifth step from C to find your dominant chord. You would say “C,D,E,F,G.” G would be your dominant chord. In the key of C, C is your root chord, G is your dominant chord, F is your sub-dominant chord, and A minor is your six chord  , Your chorus will be the most recognizable part of your song. It’s the part of your song that will hook your audience in. You’ll repeat it, exactly the same way, over and over throughout your song. You want it to be as catchy as possible.   You can set your chorus apart from the rest of your song by making it louder. Make it emotionally moving. Your audience will likely connect with your chorus more than any other part of your song., Verses tell the story of the song.If your song has lyrics, your verses should relate to the chorus. Your song should have several verses and each one should come before a chorus. All your verses should have a similar tune.   You can make each verse its own story or you can continue a story through all your verses. Your last verse should be the payoff. It should reward the audience for listening to the song and end the story. For example, if your song is about falling in love, the last verse may be about when the lovers finally kiss.  Your bridge will only appear in your song once. It serves to break up the song and its tune should be very different, musically, than that of the rest of your song. A good place to put your bridge is after two cycles of your verse and chorus.Introduce a new tune or rhythm in your bridge. Try to surprise your audience with a unique bridge they never expected. .  Write down your melody on your staff paper. Remember that most of the tune of the song should be written in the treble clef (the top clef to the right of middle C on the piano) and played with your right hand. The notes in your bass clef (the bottom clef to the left of middle C on the piano) should be played with your left hand and used mostly to keep rhythm.Chords in your bass clef can be a great way to keep rhythm.   The notes on the lines in the treble clef from bottom to top are E,G,B,D,F. They can be remembered by the device “Every good boy does fine.” The notes on the spaces of the treble clef are F,A,C,E. You can remember they spell face. The notes on the lines in the bass clef are G,B,D,F,A. You can remember them with the device “Great big dogs fight animals.” The notes on spaces of the bass clef are A,C,E,G. You can remember them with the device “All cows eat grass.”  , When you’ve written all the parts of your song, arrange them in the best possible order. Decide how many times you want to repeat your melody and chorus. Choose the best place to play your bridge. Find the best flow for your song.   You can always change this later on. What sounds like the best arrangement today may not sound as good the next day.  Write an attention grabbing intro to begin your song. Make sure it fits in with your key and time signature. Keep the intro short and sweet, you want to move into the meat of your song as quickly as possible.   Sometimes intros can be longer. The keyboard solo at the beginning of “Baba O’Riley” by The Who is an example of a long intro being used very effectively to build suspense.  Play your song as many different ways as you can. Experiment with making parts of it louder and softer. You may even change parts of the song entirely the more you play it. Be creative and let yourself explore new possibilities.   Keep track of what you revise just in case you change your mind later.  After you’ve played your song a few times, decide whether or not you want to add lyrics. If you’re writing a complex, classical song, it may not need lyrics. Most pop songs however, do have lyrics. If you do decide your song needs lyrics, try to write words that are catchy and that fit into the mood of your song.   One way to write catchy lyrics is by making them rhyme. In “Imagine” John Lennon says “Imagine there’s no heaven. It’s easy if you try. No hell below us. Above us only sky.”  , Play your song over and over until you can play it comfortably without much thought. Practice your song slowly until you can play it perfectly so that your mind has time to absorb everything and your fingers build the correct muscle memory.Break the song down. Try to learn only a few measures at a time. When you have those down perfectly, move on to the next few measures. When you start to lose concentration, take a break. You’ll be wasting your time trying to play the piano if your brain is too tired to focus.  You’ll need someone to perform for. The first few times you perform you’ll want a supportive audience as everything might not go as planned. Your friends and family are unlikely to be too critical if you make a few mistakes the first few times you perform your song for them.   As you gain experience, you may want to visit open mics or find other places musicians can perform.  Share your hard work with the world. If you start to feel a little bit of performance anxiety, take deep breaths until you feel yourself relaxing. Better yet, you can channel all our nervous energy into your performance.Try to feel all the emotions you felt writing your song when performing it for an audience.  You don’t have to pander to everyone’s opinion but you should at least hear it. You may get great advice about how to make your song more interesting or tips on how to put on a more exciting performance.   Take criticism with a grain of salt. Sometimes people will be jealous of your skill and say things just to be mean. Run everyone’s advice through your own filter. Sometimes well-meaning people may give bad advice.

Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters; they are much too delicate. Use pair of heavy duty ones instead. Memory wire is hard, and it can easily dull a good pair of wire cutters., Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of round-nose pliers. Twist the wire around the top of the pliers to form a loop, then pull the pliers out. Use the plies to squeeze the loop smaller, if needed. This will hold the beads in place and prevent them from sliding off the end of the wire.  You can use different shapes, sizes, and colors of beads, or just one type for something simple. You can even use a different type of bead on each coil.   Don't cover the entire wire with beads. Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tail at the end.. Small beads, such as bicorns and seed beads work great for memory wire bracelets. Avoid using any large, chunky beads, especially towards the end, as they might slide past the loops.  Pinch the end of the wire with your round-nose pliers, and wrap the wire around it to form a loop. Pull the pliers out, and use them to pinch the loop smaller, if necessary.  Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull apart a jump ring. Slip a charm onto the jump ring, then place the ring where you want it on the bracelet. Use the needle-nose pliers to close the ring. Great places to put charms include at either end of the bracelet, or in the middle between two beads.	Measure out at least three coils of memory wire, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), and cut it using a pair of wire cutters. Use your round-nose plies to make a small loop at one end of the wire. Thread your beads onto the wire, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) tail. Fold the tail end of the wire into another loop. Consider adding a charm using a jump ring. Finished.
Mold can be visible, but it can also grow in air ducts, crawlspaces, rafters, and between walls. If you can’t see any mold, but you detect a noticeable musty earth smell, you most likely have mold growth that you can’t see.  Mildew and mold will begin developing within 24-48 hours of exposure to moisture. It will quickly continue to grow until the moisture is completely removed and the mold is exterminated., If any cables or wiring are wet or moldy, shut the power off before cleaning. Have an electrician examine the wiring before turning the power back on again.  You will want to dry out the moldy or wet area as quickly as possible to prevent the mold from spreading. The longer you leave an area wet, the more likely mold will form.   Open the windows if humidity outside is lower than inside. Use fans to remove moisture only if mold has not started growing. Fans can spread mold spores to other areas. Remove all wet items from the area, including furniture, carpets, toys, etc. Throw away any moldy carpeting. Mold will be almost impossible to remove from the carpet fibers. All other items can be cleaned and disinfected separately. Discard any contaminated food products. This means anything not sealed in a watertight container.  If the wall has been water damaged by a flood, you will need to remove all of the wet material, including insulation, wood by-products, and anything else porous.   Drywall is incredibly porous and should be replaced at the soonest sign of water damage. Remove the wallboard to a foot above the water mark. You can drain walls by removing the baseboard and drilling holes into the floor. Make sure to check the interior of the wall for any hidden mold growth.  If you are faced with a significant amount of mold growth, consider hiring professional cleaners. Mold is very hazardous when being cleaned, because disturbing the mold will cause it to release spores.   Make sure that the area you are cleaning is well-ventilated. Always wear gloves, a mask or respirator, and eye protection.  Material such as metal, solid wood, plastic, and glass should be washed first with a non-ammonia soap and hot water. Use a stiff brush on rough surfaces such as concrete.   Use a wet-dry shop vacuum to remove standing water. Disinfect all surfaces after cleaning with a 10% bleach solution. Allow the solution to stay on the surface for at least 10 minutes before rinsing with clean water or drying.  Upholstered furniture, clothing, bedding, rugs, carpets, books, and more are all porous items. If you can’t decide whether to keep a contaminated object or not, err on the side of caution and throw it out.   Clean the material and then disinfect with a pine-oil cleaner. Let the material dry completely. Monitor the material for several days after cleaning for any fungal growth or odors. If mold returns, be sure to discard the item.  As soon as you start feeling adverse effects, stop what you are doing and consult a professional cleaning service. Signs include:   Breathing difficulties, including wheezing Sinus congestion Hacking cough Eye irritation, redness Bloody nose Rashes or hives Headaches, memory loss	Detect the mold. Act quickly after discovering water damage. Turn off the power. Dry out the area. Remove moisture from walls and ceilings. Size up the mold growth. Clean hard surfaces. Clean porous materials. Stop cleaning if you start exhibiting symptoms of mold exposure.
Base the number of sheets on the square footage of planting beds in your yard/garden.; , You want a few strips of foil for every few feet of mulch in your garden bed.  If you haven’t already laid the mulch, pour mulch into a wheelbarrow and then add foil. Use a hoe or gardening tool to mix the foil into the mulch.   Scatter the mulch in the garden bed. Mingle the foil into the mulch, evenly scattering pieces throughout the garden bed.  Use a garden hoe to integrate foil into the previously laid mulch, scattering the foil thoroughly.	Tear several sheets of aluminum foil. Rip the sheets into ½” to 1” long sheets. Mix foil strips with mulch. Add foil to mulch if the mulch has already been laid.
Compared to a larger hole, a split seam is fairly easy to deal with. This means: where two pieces of fabric were joined by stitching, the thread is broken or missing and the seam is now open, creating a "hole." In most cases, you can simply sew the seam back together.This can be inside a pocket, causing all your change to drop through. It may also appear in a sleeve seam, causing your elbow to stick out.  Expose the seam. You may wish to gently iron the garment on the appropriate heat setting for the fabric, and then pin the seams carefully back together.  Sew by hand (needle and thread) or machine along the original seam line with nice, small stitches for strength. Overlap the intact part of the original seam, and make sure to knot the thread well. Carefully clip any hanging threads to finish the job.Sometimes, you will need to deal with top-stitching rather than a seam: as in an applique or a patch pocket. In this case, you will want to exactly match the thread to the original, since it will be highly visible. Try to match the stitch length in making the repair.	Identify a split seam. Turn the garment inside out. Sew along the seam line.
When left exposed to air (either indoors or outdoors), wrought iron will rust readily. If there is any rust present on your piece, you should remove it instead of painting over it. This is best done with a stiff wire brush, although it can be done more efficiently with a sandblaster if you have the required space to use one. Scrub the entire piece with the brush until all visible rust is gone. You may want to do this in a garage where you can easily sweep up the metal and paint flakes afterwards.   If the wrought iron is already painted, you will get the best results if you scrub away the old coat of paint with the wire brush.; , To prepare the iron for painting, go over the whole piece with medium-grit sandpaper. This provides the ideal surface for the primer and paint to adhere to.  After sanding the piece smooth, you need to apply a coat of primer. This will help prevent the formation of rust and make your paint color appear as it should. Rust inhibiting primer is a product specifically designed for use on metals containing iron, and it can be purchased at any hardware store. It is best applied with a brush in a single thin coat.  After letting the primer dry completely, sand it lightly with medium-grit sandpaper. Clean the entire piece with a tack cloth before painting to ensure that metal flakes and dust do not mix into the paint.  For painting wrought iron, use exterior-grade enamel paint. For best results, use a "direct-to-metal" (DTM) paint that contains a rust inhibiting ingredient. Using ordinary exterior paint will lead to chipping. The paint should be applied with a brush in long, smooth strokes. A second coat can be applied if desired.	Scrub away any rust from the wrought iron. Sand the wrought iron. Apply a coat of rust inhibiting primer to the wrought iron. Sand the primer. Apply paint to the wrought iron.
This will depend on what you plan to use it for. For a gift bag, you need an idea of the dimensions of the item(s) you are wrapping. For a tote bag, consider what you plan to carry in the bag; , As long as the sheet of paper is large enough for your gift and sturdy enough to hold some weight, you can use any kind of paper you want. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Use wrapping paper if you want a holiday or special event bag,. Wrapping paper comes in all occasions, including birthdays, holidays, and weddings. Use craft paper, a cut up paper bag, or newspaper if you want to be rustic or eco-friendly. Use a thicker paper, such as construction paper, scrapbook paper, or cardstock if you want a sturdier bag.  For this project, you will need paper, scissors, and either tape, glue, or a stapler. To add handles, you'll also need a hole punch, string, ribbon, or twine, and some cardstock. Also gather any extra decorations you may want to add, such as:   Ribbon Glitter Stickers or other embellishments  , If you are making a bag to fit a specific item, you need to ensure the bag will be large enough. Fold your paper in half (if you’re using wrapping paper on a roll, don’t cut it until you have measured).Lay the item in the center of the folder paper and check that the item is smaller than the paper by at least two to three inches on all sides.   Cut wrapping paper to the size you need. Trim paper slightly if it is excessively large for your item and you want a more snug fit. For newspaper bags, you can use an entire sheet of newspaper (four pages worth) to make a large bag, or you can use a half sheet (two pages) for a smaller bag.#* If you are using thin paper, such as newspaper, and want to make a more durable bag, consider gluing two sheets together to create a single, thicker sheet. Use a glue stick or spray adhesive to do this.  Lay it on a flat, hard surface. Fold it in half lengthwise and make a gentle crease at the top of the paper to mark the halfway point. Open the paper back up.  If you're making an open-topped bag with handles, create a reinforcing borderby folding down a 2 to 3 inch (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide lip lengthwise across the top of the paper. Make a crease to mark the fold and open it up again. Cut out a strip of cardstock that’s as long as your paper and as wide as your border. Glue this to the top of your paper. Fold the reinforced border back down and glue it in place.   If your paper is the same color on both sides (or has the patterns only on one side) leave the border as it is, and move on. If your paper has a design on both sides, (like scrapbook paper), flip the paper over so that the border will be on the outside.  Working with the paper lengthwise, fold both sides in to the center crease that you created. Overlap them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Hold the seam together with one hand, and crease the two side folds with your other hand. These are the sides of your bag, and the open ends are the top and bottom. Glue, tape, or staple the half-inch seam in the center together.If you are using glue, try to use a thin, lightweight glue, such as a glue stick or rubber cement. If you use white glue, apply it in a thin layer. Be sure to give the glue a few minutes to dry before moving on to the next step. If you are using tape, consider using thin, clear, double-sided tape. You can also try using glue-dots as well, provided that they are thin enough. Don't use the thick, white foam mounting tape, or your bag will look lumpy. Staplers can only reach so far. They might be better for smaller bags, or for ones with a rustic look.  Grab your gift item and measure the width to determine how wide the bag needs to be. Write this number down as your bag width. Add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to that, fold up the bottom of the bag by that measurement, and crease the fold., To start, reopen the fold you just made. Separate the two pieces of the paper that form the bottom. Start with one side, and at the side crease, push one side inward so that you can line up the side crease with the bottom crease. This side should now resemble a large triangle. Hold it in place with one hand, and use your other hand to crease the two new edges of the triangle.   Repeat on the other side. The bottom of the bag should now look like a hexagon.  Fold them just enough so they overlap by a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Glue or tape the two flaps down. Allow them to dry. This has created the bottom of your bag.   If you are using glue, try using a sturdier glue, such as white glue. Be sure to let the glue dry completely before moving on. You can use thin, clear double-sided tape, but it may not create the most durable bottom. If you do use double-sided tape, plan on using the bag for lightweight gifts.  Fold the sides of the bag over based on your bag width. Open the side and bottom folds you made so you can open the bag from the top. Gently push out the sides and bottom, and work out the four corners with your fingers. Square the bottom, gently pinching the bottom sides to create a fold. Adjust side creases so they form nice, square corners.   For a quick gift bag, insert your gift and pinch the top together. Either fold it down and tape it as is, or fold the sides in to create a triangle before folding it over and taping it shut.Your quick bag is now ready to be gifted!  , You can personalize and customize your bag using any decorations you like, such as glitter, stickers, flowers or bows, or any other ornaments. Here are a few more ideas to get you started:   If your bag is made out of solid-colored paper, you can make it look more interesting by painting on designs. You can go free-hand or use stencils. Decorate a solid-colored bag with stickers or stamps to mimic a new pattern. If your bag has an existing pattern, consider outlining parts of that pattern using matching glitter glue. Embellish your bag with rhinestones, buttons, or small paper flowers. Glue some ribbon or lace along the top edge of the bag.  Collapse the top of the bag so the sides sit flat together. Use a pen or pencil to mark the two spots where you want the handles to go (somewhere in the top reinforced border you created). Use a hole puncher to punch out holes at each marked spot, going through both sides of the bag. Cut two long pieces of string, thin rope, or ribbon, and thread them through the holes. How you tie the string off will depend on the thickness of the string:   For thin, sheer ribbon: thread both ends of the ribbon through both holes on the front of your bag. Tie both ends together into a tight knot inside the bag. Repeat this for the back of the bag with the other ribbon. For thicker ribbon/rope: thread both ends of a thin rope the holes on the front of your bag. Tie each end of the rope into a knot, separately. Repeat this for the back of the bag with the other piece of rope. You can make the handles as long or as short as you want. Ideally, you should be able to slip the handles over your forearm. To make the holes stronger, consider putting a metal grommet through each hole using a grommet setter.  Another way to finish your bag is to seal it with a ribbon. First, close the top half of your bag and flatten it. Fold a one inch (2.54 centimeters) lip toward the back of the bag, and then fold it on itself again. Punch two holes in the center of the lip that are three to four inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) apart. Next:Reopen the bag and place your gift inside. Cut a length of ribbon or twine long enough to make a bow, plus an extra few inches. Flatten out the top of the bag again and refold the lip both times. Starting from the back, run each end of a piece of ribbon through each hole so the ends come out at the front of the bag. Tie the ribbon in a bow.  For a bag that’s more ornamental, you can create an accordion top and seal it with a bow. First, place your gift in the bag. Collapse the top of the bag so the sides fold inward and the front and back come together. Then:   Fold the top of the bag down ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). On the opposite side, fold the top down another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Continue folding the bag down on alternating sides until you've done this five to seven times. Fan open the folds so they look like an accordion. Pinch down the center, wrap a ribbon around the bag, and tie a bow in the center of the accordion folds to keep them in place., Instead of making a new bag out of paper, you can also jazz up old paper shopping bags to use for gifts. Refold the bag and lay it flat.  Close the bag so that it lays flat. Turn an iron on to the lowest heat setting. Run the iron over the bag. Keep the iron moving and don’t linger on any spots to avoid burning the bag. Iron out any wrinkles.  How you decorate your bag is entirely up to you. You can make it as fancy or as plain as you like. If your bag has an existing pattern or color scheme, however, try to match that pattern or color scheme as best you can. For example, if you have a delicate white and silver bag, some silver ribbon or delicate lace might look better than clunky red and yellow buttons. Here are some ideas to get you started:   If your bag is solid-colored paper, consider drawing or painting on it. Decorate a plain bag with stickers or stamps. If you keep the shapes consistent, it could look like a pattern. If your bag already has a design on it, consider outlining some of the designs with matching glitter glue. You can even glue on rhinestones for added flair. Consider gluing a ribbon or lace along the top edge of the bag. Embellish a bag with small buttons or rhinestones. Buttons are great for adding that homemade touch to bags made out of solid-colored paper.  Once you have finished decorating the body of the bag, take a look at the handles. Do they need replacing? Does the original ribbon or rope still match the bag? If not, then consider doing any of the following:   Take out the old handles and replace them with new ones. The new ones don't have to be same as the old ones, but you might want to make the new ribbon or rope match the bag. To add handles to a bag that doesn't have any: fold the top 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the bag down inside and glue it in place. Punch two holes on each side and add handles as before. Seal the bag with a sticker or adhesive gift bow. Cut out the handles (if any) and put the gift inside the bag. Fold the top over twice, by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Hold the folded top down with a stick or gift bow that matches the bag's design. Seal the bag with a ribbon. Cut out the handles (if any) and put the gift inside the bag. Fold the top over twice, by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Punch two holes in the folded top, several inches apart. Starting from the back of the bag, thread both ends of a ribbon through both holes. Tie both ends of the ribbon into a bow at the front of the bag.	Determine what size bag you need. Choose your paper. Gather your tools. Measure your paper. Lay out your paper. Make a border. Make a basic bag shape. Size the bag bottom. Create the bag bottom. Fold the top and bottom edges of the hexagon. Shape your bag. Decorate your bag. Consider adding handles. Consider closing the bag with a ribbon instead. Create an accordion top.

Your seat belt won't work as effectively if your seat is reclining back. Look for a lever on the side of your seat. This is usually on the side facing the side door. Pull it up until your seat is as close to a 90-degree angle as possible., The farther you're sitting from the dashboard, the safer you'll be in a collision. Move the handle under your seat, usually right in the middle, to move the seat forward or backward. If you're driving, make sure you can see well out of all windows and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the steering wheel.If you're vertically challenged, purchase an accessory specially designed to adjust your height in a vehicle. Pillows, books, and other quick fixes can slide and actually cause you to crash. Contact your local AAA club or auto insurance provider for assistance., Place your hips and back firmly against the seat back. You shouldn't have any room between the backs of your shoulders and the seat. This is to make sure your seat belt fits snugly and keeps you in place during a crash. If you slouch, you're putting yourself at risk for serious injuries like strangulation., The headrest is designed to keep your head from snapping back in a crash. Position it so that it's level with the tops of your ears and as close to your head as possible. Don't literally rest your head on the headrest while driving or as a passenger., Don't slip it behind your back or under your arm.If you're pregnant, make sure the strap runs between your breasts and clear of your baby bump.You can skip this step if you're in an older car whose seat belt only goes across the lap.  Avoid placing it over your stomach. Make sure the belt fits snugly. If you're pregnant, adjust this belt below your baby bump to avoid fetal injury.A word of warning to expectant moms: Avoid positioning devices like the “Preggi Pillow” or harnesses with shoulder straps only. Crash tests have shown them to be even more harmful to you and your baby., Slide the metal end of the buckle into the latching device. You should hear a click. Make sure the belt is secure by tugging on it. If the belt doesn't come unlatched, the seat belt is secure.	Place your seat in the upright position. Move the seat away from the dashboard. Sit up straight. Adjust the headrest. Wear the shoulder strap across your upper chest. Adjust the lower strap across your hips. Click the seat belt latch into place.
Most ovens don’t stay at a low enough temperature to dehydrate food, but check to see if it can stay at a temperature of 135ºF (57ºC). If it does, arrange the tomatoes on a baking tray and dehydrate them according to this recipe.  Leave the seeds inside if you want to rehydrate them as whole tomatoes or snack on the dehydrated tomatoes. Scoop them out with a teaspoon if you prefer tomatoes without seeds.  Ensure there is one-half inch (1.3cm) between each tomato half so that air can flow through.  Allow them to dehydrate for 18 to 24 hours.  Fill to the top. You can also grind them in a coffee grinder to make tomato powder.	Purchase a dehydrator. Slice tomatoes in half from top to tip. Arrange them on your dehydrator tray with the cut side up. Set them to 135ºF (57ºC). Cool them and place them in airtight containers, such as canning jars. Rehydrate them in stock, water or wine before they go into your next sauce.
An X-cuff is aptly named for the series of ‘X’ shapes that appear in the completed cuff. Because of its width, though, it requires a bit more string and beads than a regular cuff. It is also particularly attractive if you use an assortment of colors for your beads. Regardless, grab a spool of elastic string, pony beads of your choice, and a pair of scissors.  Wrap your string around your wrist to estimate the length for the cuff, and then tie a knot on the end to secure it (leaving a tail). Add on beads in a color pattern of your choice, pulling them taut to the knot on the end. When you’ve beaded an entire row long enough to wrap around your wrist, tie the two ends together and pull the long end of the tail through the bead next to the knot.  To bead the second row, you’ll be adding a series of beads to the string and then sliding the string through the first row of beads to weave them together. Slide 3 beads onto the long string, and then pull the string through the adjacent bead in the first row. Add another 3 beads, and tuck the string through the next bead in the first row. Continue this process until you’ve worked all the way around the bracelet, and then pull the string tight to secure it.  The third row of beading is the same as the second, except that you will weave the string through the center bead (the middle bead in each set of 3 beads) from the second row. Slide the string through the row of beads in the second row until it comes out of the first ‘center’ bead. Then, add three beads, and tuck the end through the next ‘center’ bead in the second row. Continue this process all the way around until you’ve completed the third row, and pull the string tight.  Repeat the process for the third row. Pull the string through the nearest ‘center’ bead in the third row, and then add a set of three beads. Pull the tail end through the next ‘center’ bead, and then add another three beads. Continue this process all the way around the bracelet until you’ve completed the fourth row  , With four rows of beads completed, you’ve probably noticed that the cuff is a bit uneven looking - the first row is straight across, but the fourth row is wavy. This is because you’ve only completed one half of the bracelet, and need to go back to the beginning to complete the mirror half on the other side of the bracelet. Carefully weave your string through your bracelet until you reach the starting point of your first row (where the knot is tied).   If you run out of string during this step, you can add more and trim the ends short so that the knot doesn’t stand out.  Working away from the center on the opposite side of the bracelet, repeat the aforementioned steps for rows 1-4 of beads. You should end up with a total of 7 rows of beads, forming two large rows of stacking ‘X’ shapes.  When you’ve completed the two halves of the bracelet, you’re ready to tie it off! Knot the end of the string multiple times so that the beads cannot slide off of it. Then, trim the excess off both this string and the other tail end (still somewhere in the center). With that, you’re done!	Get your materials ready. Bead your first row. Bead the second row. Add the third row. Add the fourth row. Work your way back to the beginning. Complete the mirrored half of the bracelet. Finish your bracelet.
In paved areas water must be allowed to percolate downwards, therefore no mortared joints.,,, Three things you should be doing: reducing the amount of plants (native and introduced) with berries as this is a major source of food for them; stop artificial feeding; and plant dense and spiky shrubs to provide safe nesting and hiding spots for smaller birds which the Currawongs prey on.  Mine are growing in very dry situations and only get a burst of mid day sun the rest of the day they receive dappled light. Talking to some “gardening industry” people the only maintenance appears to be lifting them every five years and dividing them up and starting again. Poa australis, this is a very attractive small grey-green grassy clump which has its flower seed heads appear above the plant in spring – summer. It is hardy in all situations and the only maintenance is again to divide them after flowering as it is very easy to do and results in many more plants.	Think of the site when you are landscaping and the existing biodiversity. Use raised wooden decks rather than concrete for areas close to the house and boardwalks rather than paths.  ,For areas away from the house try to create bird habitats, leaving dead trees if they contain potential nesting sites. Reduce the Impact of Pied Currawongs. Find some grassy type plants like:  Lomandra Tanika, this plant has attractive fine green leaves, is very hardy and only grows to 50 centimeters (19.7 in). If you install a pond you will quickly attract (stripped marsh) frogs.
Although this seems obvious, you can't be a fan of you hate their music. This doesn't mean force yourself to like every single song, it just means you should generally enjoy their music.; , Coldplay is a band formed in Lond in 1998. Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of their single Yellow, followed by their debut album, Parachutes.  Coldplay originally was more of a light rock band, but has since moved into the category of alternative and even pop. Although Coldplay has remained an enjoyable band over the years, some longtime fans may be offended if you forget Coldplay's roots.  There's:   Chris Martin, lead vocalist and pianist Johnny Buckland, lead guitarist Guy Berryman, bassist Will Champion, lead drummer and backup vocals  , Currently, there are:   Parachutes A Rush Of Blood To The Head X&Y Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends Mylo Xyloto Ghost Stories A Head Full Of Dreams  , Chris Martin is a crazy guy at the concerts. You can't get the full effect unless you're there in person.  It may be a bit difficult to remember the lyrics for all of their songs, so just remember some of the most notable songs, like Viva La Vida and Adventure Of A Lifetime.  In interviews, Chris Martin has revealed the meanings of a few of his songs, but some are ambiguous and can be interpreted many ways. ,, This is the long part. Coldplay has released many singles, but only a few live albums. Some can only be found on their official website.  These include Miracles, which was composed for the film Unbroken, the acoustic versions of their songs, remixes (such as the Seeb Adventure of a Lifetime remix), Prospekt's March, and other songs bundled with their singles.  There are a ton of underrated Coldplay songs, like Lost?, Lost!, Lost+, Lost-, Lost@, Lovers in Japan, Birds, Lhuna, Speed of Sound, Talk, and Such A Rush.

Keeping up with your car's recommended maintenance schedule can help avoid costly problems with your cooling system, drive train, suspension and other components; following the recommended schedule also helps ensure you the get the full benefit of the manufacturer's warranty.; , Especially, avoid short trips. Cold starts are hard on engines, your gas mileage, and the environment. Short trips can also significantly shorten the life of your muffler. Basically, you get condensation in the exhaust when you start a cold engine, and if you don't run the car for long enough to evaporate all of the condensation out of the system, excessive amounts of water can accumulate in your muffler, and rust a hole through it. Avoid starting a cold car just to pull it into the garage, for instance. Consider walking to the nearest store for a change. Combine short errands, and, if you have multiple vehicles, drive the one more recently driven when you go out again. Do drive a car at least every week or so, since cars that sit for longer than a week or two at a time have other problems, such as fluids gradually draining out of systems. Consult a mechanic if you will store a car for an extended period.  A good time to do so is when you fill up with gasoline/petrol. Even if your car doesn't leak fluids at the moment, one can occur at any time and you can identify it by checking the fluid levels often. You should also check the color of some of these fluids. Some of these have see-through plastic tanks that you can look through, and some have dipsticks. Antifreeze should be either pink, green, or yellow (Pink for newer cars with "Dex-Cool", green for old cars with plain Ethyl-Glycol, and green or yellow for cars that have been flushed and filled with universal antifreeze...brown antifreeze should always be flushed, it either has rust or a lot of dirt in it, probably both. Also, never mix different kinds of antifreeze; if you don't know what color antifreeze your car has, buy a universal brand. Oil will normally be slightly clear (when new) to brown. Oil that looks white and milkshake-like may be contaminated with antifreeze/coolant or very rarely, just a large amount of condensation. You should take your vehicle in for service soon if this is the case. Transmission fluid should be bright red, and should not smell burnt. If it looks or smells burnt, have your transmission fluid flushed. Letting it get too bad can damage your transmission. There's also a chance that you may have an internal transmission problem, especially if you are having problems with shifting or engaging in gears.  This will improve your gas mileage and protect your engine. The recommended mileage between oil changes is 3,000 - 5,000 miles (or 5000 - 8000 kilometres) or every 3 to 6 months, depending on the type of oil you use and your driving conditions. Doing this could make it possible for your vehicle to attain 200,000 miles (or about 320,000 kilometres). Change the oil filter at the same time; there is no sense in putting clean oil through a dirty filter, and filters are very cheap and available at any auto parts store. If you're unsure how often to change your oil, check your car's owner's manual or contact the dealer for your car's make. In general, conventional oil and harsh driving conditions (like short trips, taxi/police/delivery use, extreme weather, heavy loads) will require more frequent oil changes than fully synthetic oils and light driving conditions.  This is something you can do easily at home with few or no tools. A screwdriver may be required. You can buy a matching filter at nearly any auto parts store and your owner's manual will show you where your air filter is located. A dirty, dusty filter can slightly hamper gas mileage and make your car accelerate poorly.  Check this timetable against your owner's manual. Newer cars generally allow longer intervals between changes. Change transmission fluid & filter at least every 50,000 miles (40k to 45k is even better). Older fluids don't lubricate and cool parts as well as fresh fluid and may leave your car unprotected in severe conditions (for example, old antifreeze may not perform well in a very cold winter).  This will cause damage to your brake rotors ("discs") at least and possibly your calipers as well. Rotors and calipers are much more expensive to replace than pads. There is no such thing as "cleaning" a brake pad while it is still on a car - the friction between the pad and rotor will eradicate any outside substance almost immediately.  Changing tire position is very important and reduces uneven wear and tear on the tread, thus extending the life of the tires. The recommended rotation cycle is twice a year or every 6,000 - 7,500 miles. Rotate them diagonally - front right to rear left and front left to rear right. However, this pattern can change depending on the drivetrain of the vehicle, and the type of tire. Your vehicle manual will contain detailed rotation information. Keep in mind some tires (especially on sports cars) are directional and are meant to spin only one way. They will have a large arrow on the sidewall to indicate this.  Under-inflated tires can reduce the tire life by 15% and will slightly decrease your gas mileage, perhaps by 10%. Inflating tires is perhaps the easiest of all activities, and many stores sell tire gauges for a very small cost. Checking your tire pressure every other time you get gas will reduce tire wear and prevent these issues. Monitor your tire tread with a penny. Insert the penny into the tread with Lincoln's head down. If the top of his head is not obscured by the tread, your tires need to be replaced. Basically, if you can see all of Lincoln's head, you must replace your tires.  If you notice your car shaking while driving at high speeds (not while braking - shuddering while braking indicates warped rotors), or if your tread is wearing unevenly, then you may need an alignment. This is also key to extending the life of your tires and will keep the tread even for increased safety.  Start the car and drive off slowly and gently until the car reaches operating temperature (known as closed loop). This reduces the strain on the engine while the oil is still cold and thicker. Another option is to use electric engine space heaters, and start the drive with a warm engine. Accelerate promptly to the target speed. For most modern cars, idling a cold engine is both counterproductive and wasteful. Additionally, as you accelerate, release the gas a bit to cause the automatic transmission to upshift while you are not pressing hard on the gas. This causes less wear on the internal clutches. It is easier on the clutches for the car to shift when you ease up on the gas.  Even if you are driving a car with an automatic transmission, use your parking brake regularly, especially if you're parked on an incline. It helps keep the brakes adjusted in the rear of the car and makes them last longer. Do not use your parking brake in the wintertime because your brake will freeze and it will be stuck until it thaws out.  Without regular cleaning, you can start to notice rust on the bottom of your doors within four years. Another three to four years and the corrosion will creep to underbody components, like brake lines. It can cost thousands in rust-related repairs if you neglect to wash your car, especially near ocean/gulf shorelines where the road sand or morning dew might be salty.	Read the car's manual and schedule maintenance accordingly. Drive less. Check the fluids: You should check the level of your antifreeze, oil, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and brake fluid, very regularly. Change the oil regularly. Change the air filter. Flush these fluids every two years: power steering fluid, brake fluid, and cooling system anti-freeze. Monitor your brake pad thickness and don't let the pads wear down to metal. Rotate the tires. Keep the tires inflated. Keep the front end aligned. Get your car off to a good start every time you drive it. Use your parking brake. Wash your car: Road salt, sludge and pollution can lead to costly body work.
Use a high quality leather cleaner that does not have any oils or wax additives. Try using a leather cleaning cloth or high quality microfiber cloth rather than a cotton rag or towel. Microfiber cloths pull the soil into the cloth while lesser quality cloths just push the solid around.

If the light is permanently connected to power, shut off the breaker. Do not disassemble the unit without disconnecting power.      ; , Make sure you don't break them! You can put them off to the side.  The plate is usually screwed or clipped in, and easily removed. Make sure you save any screws or clips in a little pile for re-assembly.  The ballast is the heavy metal block with several wires coming out of it. Disconnect the wires from power connection and from the contacts at the ends of the unit. Some units you cannot unwire, so you'll have to cut the wires and use wire nuts for re-assembly. If the wires don't come off, snip them.         If you have to snip wires, take a few pictures first so you can be assured you'll re-attach everything correctly.  Caution: If the power has been on the light, the ballast will likely be very hot.  It is usually screwed into the light fixture on the sides. As always, make sure you save all screws for later. Some ballasts fit into metal grooves, also called tabs, to take some of the weight off the screws. Note how your particular ballast is installed before removing to make replacement easier.  Almost all ballasts sold today are electronic, and they can range from $12-$200, depending on your light. Use the old ballast to determine the exact wattage of your new one. Ballasts can be found at most major hardware stores. When buying, you'll need to know:   Your light's wattage The number of bulbs in the light The wiring system on your old ballast., Before you get into the wiring, securely mount the ballast to the fixture.  Be sure you've connected the color-coded wires to the proper terminals and to the power connection. Check it again. You really want to get this right the first time. If the wires clip right in, then this should be easy. For older models, you may have to do some basic wiring. To do so:          Cut wires to appropriate length Strip 1/4" of sheathing from the wires. Group the matching wires from ballast to light according to your ballast's manual Feed both ends of matching wire (one from the ballast, one from the light) into the wire nut. Twist the nut clockwise to combine the wires, making sure the nut is very tight. Give the nut a slight tug to make sure everything is secure., Fluorescent lights really only have two parts -- the tube and the ballast. This means a new ballast is really the only repair you'll need to make to fix a humming bulb.          If you have flickering or continued issues, check the sockets. A bad or loose socket may be the culprit. Finally, try replacing the light. They are cheap and easy to swap out.	Unplug the unit or flip the breaker off if it is directly plugged into the wall. Remove fluorescent tubes and set safely aside. Remove the cover plate that was hiding above the bulbs. Unhook all wires attached to the ballast. Remove the ballast. Buy a new electronic ballast suitable for the wattage of your lamp, using the one you removed as a guide. Screw the new ballast into the unit. Re-connect the wires by following the manual with your particular ballast. Replace the cover and tubes, then flip the light on to check.
Black spot has the following indicators:   Circular black spots with fringed margins on the leaves. The lower leaves tend to be infected first, after which it spreads quickly. Upper leaves often turn yellow and fall off. The plant becomes weaker and it either blooms less or not at all.  This helps to slow down any further progression of the fungus.   Clean up and safely dispose of black spot infected leaves that have fallen to the ground immediately. If left to lie below a rose, the spores of the fungi will start climbing the rose again as soon as the temperature and moisture are right in the spring.  Even without signs of black spot, this is an important part of good rose preventative maintenance. Fungicides include trifloxystrobin, Ziram, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, Thiophanate-methyl, and several others. For advice on an appropriate spray or powder for your local area, discuss directly with your local garden center.  In severe cases black spots can be seen on the stems of the roses. Be sure that these are removed as quickly as they are noticed.	Know what you're looking for. Remove and place in trash bag any infected leaves and branches as soon as you see signs of black spot. Spray roses every 7 to 14 days with a fungicide during growing months. Prune canes back to wood uninfected by black spot before the growing season.
Listen for the click or other sound it makes when it shut, several of the newer roller coasters don't have 'clicking' restraints. This means you can have the restraint closer to your lap so you don't moved as much. These restraints are still perfectly safe and they won't unlock during the ride.  It can be tempting to shut them but you can become disorientated making you feel nauseated. .  This can help you to keep calm and can reduce the possibility of vomiting. Count under your breath if it helps you to keep your breathing steady.  There is often music accompanying the ride. This may help to calm you if you concentrate on listening to the words or tune.  That's what the ride's all about anyway! When you scream going down from high drops, it helps to expel the air and helps you to breathe as well as releasing stress to help you have fun!  , Talking is a good way to distract yourself during the ride. However, if it's hard to hear, you might end up yelling rather than talking, so be considerate of other people. The best time to talk is on the lift hill, this is the part where you have to wait to drop.  This can help you to feel less scared. It's not ideal to sit here if you're looking for more thrills though. However, if you aim to not see the biggest field of view, the cart behind will allow for that.  You did it. And you know you can do it again. Overcoming fear is a constant challenge in life and it's a great thing that you're practicing this lifelong skill.	Double check your harness, bar or other restraint. Keep your eyes open!, Aim to breathe deeply. Listen for the music. Scream. Talk to your buddies. Stay at the front. Praise yourself at the end.
When choosing decorations for your staircase, you can bring everything together by choosing a specific theme. This can help give you an idea for what kind of art, photos, and other decorations to add to the wall around your staircase.   For example, maybe you used chalkboard paint on your staircase. This gives you staircase an eccentric, kid-friendly feel. You could put up your children's art work on the wall around the staircase. You could also add bright and colorful paintings to the wall, giving it a fun and zany feel. Deciding on how to decorate can be overwhelming. Choosing a theme based off other aspects of your home can help. If your staircase is just before your living room, which has a blue color scheme, you could continue the blue color scheme with your staircase. Choose paintings, photo frames, and other decorations that are in the right shade of blue.  Many people line the wall along their staircase with family photos. This can give visitors something to look at as they walk up your staircase, and provide a warm and homey feel to your house. Consider printing and framing some family photos for your staircase.   You can print out photos from a phone, digital camera, or flash disk at stores like FedEx and Walgreens. You can choose the size you want. When purchasing frames, consider a color scheme. If your staircase is decorated with blue fabric, for example, try adding blue frames to your chosen photos. Color coordinating your staircase design can really help tie things together.If you want something a little more lighthearted, consider making a collage without frames. Simply asymmetrically tape up a hodgepodge of family photos running up your wall., If you're not big into family photos, consider lining the wall leading up to your staircase with paintings and artwork. Visit a local art center or art museum, where you can pick up paintings, prints, and other bits of art for your staircase. If you're into crafts yourself, consider making something like a shadow box or a painting of your own to add to the wall along your staircase.  If your staircase has a railing, do not neglect this in the decorating process. Look at fun ways to incorporate the staircase railing.   Consider painting the railing. This can be particularly striking if you have banisters running along the railing. You can paint each banister a specific shade, or create a gradient of one shade running up the stairs.You can also add stencils to a wooden rail. If you've stenciled your stair risers, it can be fun to add similar stencils to the railing.  If you stop by a craft store, you can look for decorative items. Paper flowers, plastic fruit, or plastic twigs can be placed on shelves on top of the staircase or in a stair landing. These can be particularly helpful if you're going for a certain them. If you're trying to match floral wallpaper, for example, having paper flowers tied around the bannisters of your railing could be a nice touch.  Shadowboxes are enclosed glass cases that can store items like decorative plates, old books, figurines, and other knick-knacks. You can try stopping by your craft store, picking up a few shadowboxes, and filling them with items that match your decorating scheme.   You can make your own shadow box by purchasing a box frame and gluing a collage of items in the back. Keepsakes can be placed in a shadowbox to fit with a family staircase theme. For example, you could layer family photos, tickets from events, and brochures from family vacations in a shadow box.	Decide on a theme. Add family photos to the wall along the staircase. Choose paintings and other artwork. Find a fun way to decorate the railing. Try decorative items. Use shadow boxes.
Get a good, solid knot. , Once again, start with the ball. This is literally the tip area.    Try not to get too much resin on the suede part in between.  If you're not going on toe in your dance, you can be a little more lenient, but it's still a good idea to get a little on there for your drills. It also adds stability to your trebles/drillies/shuffles and/or rallies.  Add more if it will make you more comfortable. The last thing you want is to slip!	Put them on. Add on any buckles or elastics you may be wearing.  , With hard shoes, you have more area to cover. Roll back so that your heel piece is in the resin next. Get a little on the toe piece. Test it out to make sure it's enough.
You want a rose which has a nice bloom, but also no moisture or flaws. The moisture will cause molding and the flaws will be exaggerated in the drying process.You can use blooms which have opened a bit, but don’t use a rose which is already beginning to fall apart and lose its petals., You want to trim the stems, but not too short. Leave 6 inches or more of the stem for drying. Remove the foliage from the stems. The leaves will not dry nicely and should be removed.          Leaves also hold water and will slow the overall drying process., Bundle all of the roses you will be drying and wrap a rubber band around the stems. Leave at least 2 inches of stems beyond the rubber band. Continue wrapping the rubber band around the stem until the roses are secure.         You can arrange the roses into a nice bouquet before drying so they are already prepared to be displayed.  Find a room which you don’t use often, like a laundry room, attic or a utility closet. The space should still have good ventilation to allow the moisture to escape. Stretch a clothes line or rope between 2 points in this room and tie it securely. Make sure it is sturdy enough to hold your roses.You want to choose a dark space. The color of your roses will darken in the drying process, but exposing them to light will increase this color change, while using a dark space will reduce the alteration in the rose color.  Pull some of the rubber band used to wrap the roses together over the hook of a hanger. If you have a hanger with an extra hook under the hanging hook, you can strap the roses there. Otherwise, pull some of the rubber band over the hanging hook of the hanger.  Hook the hanger onto the line in the dark room and leave them to until they are dry. It can take several weeks before your roses are completely dry.  Once the roses are dry, they will be brittle. Remove them from the hanger and spray them with hairspray to reinforce and protect them from damage.         Use an unscented hairspray when spraying your roses. Spray the roses lightly to avoid saturating the roses you have just dried.	Choose roses with the best blooms for drying. Trim the rose stems. Tie rose stems together with a rubber band. String a clothesline in a cool, dark place. Attach your roses to a hanger. Hang the roses on the line for 2-3 weeks. Preserve the roses with hairspray.

Once the motor is started, you'll notice that the tines still aren't turning. To engage the tines, squeeze the levers under each handle to spin the tines.On a tiller with the tines in front, the forward motion is controlled by you. To prevent the tiller from moving forward when the tines are engaged, you'll have to pull back on the handles to hold the machine in place.  When you want to move forward and till the ground, raise the handles upward to tip the tines downward into the soil. As you push the tines into the ground, they will begin to churn the soil. Walk forward at a normal walking pace, keeping the tiller tipped at the same depth.   As you push the tiller forward, the tines will continue breaking up all the soil they come into contact with.  When you get to the end of your first row, push the machine forward in a curving motion to turn it around. Rather than trying to till the soil in the row directly beside you, move over by one row to till your next pass.   Backyard tillers aren't always easy to turn, and tilling every other row will make it easier to maneuver the machine., Once you’ve gone over each row and tilled the entire area once, repeat the same process, working in the opposite direction. For instance, if you tilled in horizontal passes the first time around, do vertical passes this time.On the second pass, push the tines farther into the soil to till at a deeper depth. Changing your direction and making two passes with the tiller will ensure you fully till all the soil and blend in all the organic matter.  When you’ve finished tilling the soil, release the levers under the handles to stop the tines from moving. Turn the machine off by flicking the switch on the engine.  A hand tiller is a manual, non-motorized tiller. Some hand tillers have a bladed wheel that let you push the tiller forward when it’s in the ground, but others have to be moved from one spot to another. To start, push the blades or spikes into the soil to the right tilling depth for your garden, usually between 6 and 8 inches (15 and 20 cm).   For a tiller with a bladed wheel, push the tiller forward while it’s in the ground. This will rotate the blades and till the soil. For a tiller without the wheel, twist the tiller as you pull it straight out of the ground. Move the tiller over to an adjacent patch of soil, insert the spikes and repeat.	Pull up the levers under the handles. Tip the tiller forward. Make passes on alternating rows. Go over the area again in the opposite direction. Turn the machine off. Use a hand tiller instead.
One thing that can dampen romance is the boredom of routine. This can apply to your bedroom if you have had the same setup for a long time. Try moving the bed to a different wall, facing a new direction in the room. Move dressers, chairs or any other furniture to new places as well. Giving the room a completely new look will make it feel almost like you are staying in a romantic getaway rather than your same old room.You may want to draw out potential room layouts before you start moving things to ensure that the setup you hope for is achievable. Maybe your options are limited but drawing it out can help you figure out what could be moved. If moving the entire bed is not an option, especially if space is limited, considering moving the rest of the room around so at least the arrangement is new. If you are working in a living room, you can move the couch to a new location, or maybe move two chairs close together so you can easily sit and talk. Don’t have them facing each other head on, but don’t have them completely beside each other either. Angle them toward each other while giving those sitting there the option to look slightly away, too.  If significant remodeling in the bedroom is an option, putting recessed lights in the wall is great for establishing a better mood. Overhead lights tend to be unflattering, so moving away from those for the bedroom is smart. You will most likely not be able to do this on your own, unless you have specific electrical training, so consider the cost of a contractor and whether it fits your budget.   This is also a good time to evaluate the light bulbs you are using. Even if you can’t install new lights, you can change bulbs. Go for bulbs with a soft white/or warm white light and use 60 watt or lower so best brightness. Overall, it is good to assess how your room is lit and what ways you can change it. Remodeling and adding new fixed lighting may not work, but consider adding a couple lamps if your room doesn’t already have them. For day to day routines, you can still use overhead lighting, but for times when you want to increase the romance, stick to low lit lamps. Dimmer switches are a great addition to any room because they give you the option of having full light for regular daily activities and lower mood lighting for specific romantic occasions.  This is obviously an expensive and long term option, but since the bed is the centerpiece of the room and the primary location for romance, it can really affect the mood of the room. The bed should ultimately be comfortable, but how it looks is important becuase you will see if before you feel it. Old or broken down looking beds detract from the romance of the room.A large, wooden, 4 poster bed will give the room a classically romantic look. You can add a canvas canopy which softens the look and feel of the room, as well. Hang drapes down each of the posts to enhance the look. Maybe you can’t buy an entirely new bed but you can buy a new mattress. A comfier more inviting mattress will increase the romance of the room. Even if you can’t buy a mattress, considering buying a down-filled mattress cover which adds a layer of softness to the bed. Lastly, if none of these purchases are within your budget, consider buying new sheets or a bedskirt. Higher thread count sheets are softer. You could buy some red silk sheets for special occasions. Again, the specific color of the sheets is mostly personal preference, but light reds and pinks are often considered the most romantic. For rooms besides the bedroom, considering investing in other new furniture. Your mom’s old sofa that sat in the basement for two years is probably not the most romantic piece for you living room. The poker table that doubles as a dining room table may not set the mood you hope for. If it is within your budget, new furniture can be a great way to make a room more romantic.	Change your room’s layout. Install recessed lighting. Invest in a new bed.
Chunky yarn is only one term commonly used to identify yarn types within the broader "bulky yarn" category.   Many yarn brands will label the yarn as "chunky yarn," but there are a few synonymous terms that other brands may use to describe the yarn. These terms include "craft" and "rug" yarn. A better way to identify chunky yarn is by knowing its yarn weight symbol. The symbol for chunky yarn and all other forms of bulky yarn is "5."Note that the only thicker yarn category is category 6, "super bulky." Some yarns in this category might be called "super chunky." Super chunky yarn and chunky yarn are not quite the same, so you should keep that in mind when making your yarn selection.; , The right crochet hook to use can vary by project, but when no hook size is specified, you should choose a hook size that falls within the standard recommended range.   Larger hooks tend to be best for chunky yarn. In U.S. sizes, look for a hook between K-10-1/2 and M-13. In metric sizes, look for a hook between 6.5 and 9 mm. If you end up picking a super chunky yarn, the recommended hook size is M-13 and up in U.S. sizes or 9 mm and up in metric sizes., When working with single crochet, a 4-inch (10-cm) square made with chunky yarn will typically consist of 8 to 11 stitches.   For super chunky yarns, a 4-inch (10 cm) square of single crochet would consist of 5 to 9 stitches. Gauge refers to the number of stitches needed to form a 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) square using a certain type of yarn. For simple projects, like scarves and blankets, precise gauge measurements are not as important to note. For more advanced projects, like sweaters and socks, you will need to know the gauge of your yarn to prevent the final piece from being too small or too large to fit properly.  Figure out what it is that you want to make with chunky yarn. If you're still a novice, it would be best to find an actual pattern to work from. More advanced crocheters can devise their own patterns and work from there.   You can adapt a pattern that uses another type of yarn for use with chunky yarn, but doing so can be a bit difficult. Compare the two yarn gauges and determine how many more or fewer stitches you'll need to make when switching. You'll also need to use a hook that differs in size from the one recommended in the pattern instructions.  Yarns can be made from different fibers, even yarns of a single thickness. Each fiber will have a different texture and appearance. Experiment with different fibers until you find one that you like.   As a general tip, consider the intended use of the project when picking out a fiber material. A blanket or scarf will need a softer yarn fiber than a rug or handbag would probably need. Acrylic wool is a mix of natural and synthetic fibers.It tends to be inexpensive and durable, making it ideal for projects like rugs and purses. It can also be used for sweaters and scarves but may not be soft enough for those with sensitive skin. Cotton wool is soft, durable, and natural. It is generally preferred for sweaters and scarves but may still be too rough for those with very sensitive skin, like infants and toddlers. The softest wools are cashmere, silk, mohair, lambs, and alpaca. Cashmere and silk wools are typically used for scarves, shawls, and wraps, but they are more delicate and require more care. Mohair, lambswool, and alpaca wool tend to be used for blankets and sweaters, but they also require special care.  This step applies to any yarn you shop for, and chunky yarn is no exception. You'll need to figure out which color or color you want to use for your project.   Once you figure it out, buy the full number of skeins you will need. It's better to have too many than too few. The dye can be slightly different from batch to batch, so buying the same hue by name at two different times can result in having too slightly different shades. You can avoid this problem if you buy the yarn all at once. To be on the safe side, you should also check the "lot" or "dye lot" number on the back label of each skein. Make sure that the dye lot number on each skein is the same before you buy them. Otherwise, you may still end up with different shades.To determine which color is best, ask yourself about the project. Consider picking your favorite color if the project is for yourself, or your friend's favorite color if the project is for a friend. Also ask yourself which colors would match well with the intended use of the piece. For instance, choose a color that matches your coat if you plan on making yourself a scarf or a color that matches your bedroom if you plan on making yourself a blanket.  Attach the yarn to the top of your crochet hook with a slipknot, leaving only a small tail.   If you are using chunky yarn, use a size L-11 (8 mm) hook for this project. If you decide to use super chunky yarn, use a size N-15 (10 mm) hook, instead. You will only need two skeins of yarn if you want to create a cowl. For a longer infinity scarf, you may need up to four skeins. To make a slipknot:  Cross the attached end of the yarn over the loose end in a loop. Pull the attached side through the loop, drawing up a second loop. Tighten the first loop around the second. Tighten the second loop onto the hook.  Determine how wide you want the scarf to be, then make a series of chain stitches from the loop on your hook to match that width.   For a cowl, you'll need to make a foundation chain of about 26 stitches with chunky yarn or 31 stitches with super chunky yarn. For a longer infinity scarf, the chain should have about 36 stitches with chunky yarn or 41 stitches with super chunky yarn.To make a chain stitch:  Wrap the yarn halfway around the hook from the back. Pull this yarn-over through the previous loop on the hook. This completes one chain stitch.  Count the stitches in your foundation chain, stopping once you reach the sixth one from the hook. Work one double crochet into that sixth stitch.   For this project, you should work each double crochet into the single loop at the back side of its respective stitch. Do not crochet into the front side loops. To double crochet:  Wrap the yarn once over the hook. Insert the hook into the indicated stitch. Yarn over the hook from the back of the stitch. Pull the yarn back through the stitch and to the front of the work. Wrap the yarn over the hook again. Draw this yarn-over through the first two loops on the hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook once more. Draw this yarn-over through the last two loops on the hook.  Work two chain stitches from the loop currently on your hook.  Work one more double crochet into the exact same spot you worked the previous double crochet in.   The first double crochet, the two chain stitches, and this second double crochet all combine to form one V-stitch. You'll be repeating the V-stitch all throughout the project.  Skip over two stitches in your foundation chain, then work another V-stitch into the stitch after that. Skip over another two stitches, then work another V-stitch into the stitch that follows. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the foundation chain.   For each V-stitch:  Double crochet once into the correct stitch. Chain two. Double crochet once more into the same stitch.   You should finish the row by working one double crochet into the last stitch of your foundation chain.  Flip the work over so that the hook is on your dominant side again, then work a turning chain of three chain stitches.   This turning chain brings the height of the next row up to the correct stitch height. Without the turning chain, the width of the scarf will be uneven.  Work one double crochet into the first of the chain-two spaces created in your previous row.   This is the beginning of your first V-stitch for this row. Make sure that you crochet into the first chain-two space. If there is another space before it, you should skip over it and work directly with the chain-two space. Otherwise, the final width of the piece might be uneven.  Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.  Work one more double crochet into the same space as the first double crochet of the row.   This step completes the first V-stitch of this row.  Work one V-stitch into each chain-two space created in your previous row. Continue until you reach the end of this row.   End the row by working one double crochet into the second loop of the last double crochet of the row below.  Each row should be worked in the same way as the previous row. Make as many rows as desired until you reach your ideal length.   Chain three at the end of each row. Work one V-stitch into each chain-two space of the previous row. Work one double crochet into the second loop of the last double crochet at the end of each row. A cowl will only need to be long enough to fit around your head and neck, or about 18 inches (46 cm). An infinity scarf will need to be two to three times longer, or about 48 inches (122 cm).  Fold the scarf in half crosswise, halving the length. Make sure that both edges are evenly aligned and all four corners meet.  Work one single crochet into the first stitch of the top layer and the first stitch of the bottom layer at the same time.   Repeat this process, working one single crochet into each set of stitches from both layers, until you reach the bottom corners of the scarf. This creates a neat, barely visible seam along the back of your scarf or cowl. To make a single crochet:  Insert the hook into the indicated stitch. Yarn over the hook from the back. Pull the hook back through to the front of the stitch. Wrap the yarn over the hook once more. Pull this final yarn-over through both loops on your hook.  Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the final loop on your hook. Weave any excess yarn into the back side of your scarf to hide and secure the remaining tail.   This step completes the project.	Learn how to identify chunky yarn. Choose the best hook size. Note the standard gauge range. Plan your project. Pick the best material. Find the right color. Make a slipknot. Create a foundation chain. Double crochet into the sixth stitch from the hook. Chain two. Double crochet into the same stitch. Repeat across the chain. Turn and chain three. Double crochet into the first space. Chain two. Double crochet into the same space. Repeat across the row. Repeat the row pattern until you reach your desired length. Fold the scarf in half. Stitch the ends together. Fasten off the yarn.
; , Make sure you have tied the ribbons securely. , Let your platform touch the floor, and when you plie, you should arch your foot. Do the same crossing your left leg over your right.  Relax your arms, and then roll up onto pointe. Now roll back down to flat. Focus on rolling through the demi-pointe. Don't bend your legs while doing this. Repeat a few more times.  With your right foot, go through your demi-pointe and put pressure on your foot in this position. Now roll all the way through to a propped foot. Push over. Roll through your demi-pointe into flat position. Repeat with your left foot, and repeat the entire exercise a few more times.  Roll down. Now, plie, then relieve, staying in first position.  Make sure to "massage the floor", which means you should go through your demi pointe and keep contact with the floor the entire time. Put pressure on the floor like you are giving it a massage.  Relieve and stay on pointe as you plie. Some people refer to this as "pushing over". If done properly, you will be stretching out your arch.  Relieve, and then turn a 1/4 turn so that your left hand is on the barre. You should be in a fourth position here. Plie while staying up on pointe. Your back foot's weight should be only on your big toe. You don't want the whole platform to be on the floor because then you would be slicing your foot. Your front foot's weight should also be on the big toe, but only bevel your foot as much as you can without straining. After doing this, you can go back to second positioning, turn the other way, and repeat this exercise but to the left instead of the right.  Plie, and then relieve into pase. See if you can balance. Check for a straight supporting leg, strong arms, turned- out legs, and strong, turned-out feet. Close back to fifth, bringing the pase-leg back. Close with control. Repeat with the other leg.  Take one large step back away from the barre. Now, stand in fifth position, facing the barre. Plie both legs, tendu your front leg, and then, keeping your extended leg straight, step up onto that leg. This is called a pique. You should be in a pase position. Take hold of the barre to steady yourself. See if you can let go and balance. As in the previous exercise, look for a straight supporting leg, strong arms, turned-out legs, and strong, turned-out feet. Close back to fifth, bring the pase-leg back. Close with control. Take a large step back and repeat with the other foot.	Warm up in your flat shoes. Put on your pointe shoes. Stand in a parallel position facing the barre.  , Cross your right leg over your left in a plie. Stay parallel. Go into first position. Facing your barre, roll up onto pointe in a first position without bending your knees. Do some tondues. Face your barre and stand in second position. Stand in second position and face your barre. Face the barre in fifth position. Face the barre.
Browse through design magazines or make a Pinterest board to collect your interior design ideas for the space. Find themes and/or aesthetic ideas that you are least likely to outgrow over a short period of time.; , Consider keeping the theme subtle and timeless.   For example, it might be tempting to make a kid’s bedroom princess or racecar themed while they are young, but when they get older, a theme that bold and age-specific might mean redecorating. Simpler design themes like floral, nautical, or sea-themed can hint towards gender but can grow with you with time as well., Consider the makeup of your bedroom as a whole and allow it to guide you to how you want to lay out your room.   Some themes consist of a revamp of the entire room, i.e. painting walls, removing carpet, buying new items. Keep bedroom themes surface level by just changing a bedspread or a lampshade.	Research ideas for the look and feel that you want. Select a theme that will grow with you. Decide whether to integrate the theme into the room itself or limit it to accessories.
Now that you’re prepared to make a fake faint look real, you can now make it happen. Once you’re where you want your fake fainting spell to happen, make sure the conditions are right for it to occur the way you want it to.   Are enough or the right people present? Is the event you’re trying to avoid still happening? Is the hallway too crowded? Once you know things seem right, move to the general area where you want your fake fainting spell to occur. A real fainting spell happens fairly quickly from the onset of symptoms. Make sure there aren’t dangerous objects nearby that could cause serious injury if you happen to hit them when falling. And make sure you won’t hit anyone.  When you’re ready, begin exhibiting symptoms of fainting. This should only occur for a few minutes in total. If you plan to use not as your excuse not eating breakfast, mention that you’re very hungry. If the room is crowded or stuffy, you could start complaining about feeling hot. If you’re walking, start slowing down, hold your head a little, and say you feel dizzy. You can blink or squint your eyes. Complain of nausea. Pretend to suddenly lose energy, and say you feel weak. Keep up this last symptom for 1-2 minutes.  While exhibiting your symptoms, and without drawing attention to your movements, move into the spot where it seems safest to fall. If you plan on fainting while sitting, pretend you’re too weak to stand and take a seat. You can say that you feel kind of weird and that you think you need a glass of water or some fresh air.   Maybe ask someone to open a window. If you are windowless or have no water around, just say you think you need to sit down, or go out for fresh air. Sit for a bit and get up slowly. Then stumble a bit and fall forward. Before you do that say something such as "I just...." Make sure you don't finish your sentence, unless it's short.  Make sure you fall safely. You don't want to hit your head and hurt yourself. If you are standing, buckle your knees and let them hit the ground before you attempt to drop your torso. Make sure you go fast enough without making it look as if a 5000 volt surge of lightning has rushed though you, or it will seem fake.   If you are sitting, relax and imagine you actually are fainting. Let yourself fall off the chair, as it is unlikely you would stay on there if you actually did faint. Try to land on the back side of your thigh, not your hip or tailbone. Then quickly drop your torso. Just close your eyes and let all your muscles completely weaken; just relax. Act as if you have no bones and fall to the floor in a crumpled heap. This will seem real.  Lie on the ground. Make sure you aren't stiff, and if someone attempts to lift an arm and shake it, let it completely relax and when they drop it, just let it fall. This is a common 'fake spotter' test. Unconscious people don't have control over their limbs. Someone should come over to see if you are okay, causing a diversion for whatever occasion.   Don't stay down there too long, or someone might call the Emergency Services. Unless you want that to happen, make sure you don't stay out for more than 20 seconds.  People who have fainted will often awaken having not remembered that they fainted. Say all you can remember is feeling hot and that it looked as though someone dimmed the lights in the room.  After a moment, you can attempt to stand and sort of waver a bit again, so people think you might faint again and will all rush to your aid. At this moment, if people are asking you questions, you can begin to explain your fake faint away as harmless.  Rest for about ten minutes or so to pretend to recover from your fake fainting spell. When you’re ready, excuse yourself to either go home to rest or to set an appointment to visit your doctor. Someone may offer to take you somewhere, you can either accept their generosity or explain that you can get safely to your destination on your own.	Set the stage for your fake fainting spell. Complain about having symptoms of fainting. Get in position where you’ll faint. Pretend to faint. Pretend to be unconscious for a few seconds. Open your eyes and take a deep breath. Sit up slowly and after a moment, stand, or get someone to pull you to your feet. Make a semi-haste exit.
Simply cut it off in a straight line.; , Follow the bag shape as shown in the diagram: Leave the base of the tube intact.       Cut the bag lid or top as shown by the lines within the pink area of the diagram. Cut a slight curve across the top of the base part of the bag, as shown in the diagram.       Cut off a ring from the very top part of the tube (the area just under the neck that you've already removed). This will become the bag's handle.       Use a hole punch to punch out a circle in the top part of the bag, as shown in the diagram above. The hole must be the same size as the plastic bead you're using as the button clasp.       For the smaller hole, use a small sharp object to pierce it. You may want to leave making this until the next section (Making the Button Clasp).       If needed, tidy up the base of the bag by trimming (but don't cut it open).  If the tube already has a design printed on it that you're happy with, you can skip this step. On the other hand, if you don't like the proprietary design, you can fix it using decorative tape. Stick on a basic shape or make a collage using decorative tape.       Make sure that it covers up any ugly print or imagery that you don't want to show.       Use any other decorative items to embellish as liked.  Going by the measurement of the plastic thread, make a small hole as shown in the diagram, large enough to admit the plastic thread.  To know how to make the ball, refer to the plastic ball making method outlined in How to make a reminder ring from a plastic tag thread.  Follow with the large plastic bead. Pull this tight against the small hole in the bag.  Pull the bead tightly against the small hole. Make another plastic ball to firmly attach the remaining thread in place (see method above). Trim off any excess thread.  When the lid is closed, this will turn into a handle that can be held upward.  This will fasten the handle in place and the bag is now complete!  , The ring will need to be the same size as the top of the tube. Thread the beads onto beading wire, elastic or strong plastic thread. Knot well to prevent unraveling. , There are many possibilities for using this miniature bag.  Use it as a charm. Attach to a real-size bag for a cute matching curio.       Slide over the arm of a doll. This could be something a child plays with or the doll could be placed on display.       Add to gift packaging for a cute touch.       Use on a keyring.	Remove the neck from the tube. Cut out the bag shape. Fix the external design. Find a plastic tag thread or a thin piece of plastic thread. Make a ball at one end of the plastic thread. Thread on the small glass bead, down to the plastic ball you've just formed. Thread on another glass bead on the thread on the inside of the bag (this is to protect the bag plastic from the flame). Slip the ring handle around the area where the lid joins the bag's base. Close the lid over the button. Make a ring of glass seed beads. Slip onto the bag as for the plastic band handle.  , Use the small bag.
You'll need an assortment of loom bands, a plastic C-clip or S-clip, and a little patience. This project is longer than the bracelets, so it will require more bands and more time to make.  Don't twist them. Hold your thumb and index finger so that the bands stretch a little.  Slip one end of this band through the loop at the other end to form a slipknot, and pull to tighten.  You should have a circle made of four loops. Slide two more bands through the loops. Make sure you slide these new bands through all four loops!  , Continue forming circles with your bands and sliding new bands through them. You'll see a chain start to form. Repeat this process until the necklace is as long as you want it.   You can vary the number of bands you use for each "link" in your necklace; fewer bands will form a thinner link, while more bands will form a chunkier link.  Now you have a finished necklace!	Gather your materials. Wrap two bands around your thumb and index finger. Wrap a band in a different color around the middle of the bands you're holding. Hold the loops from the first two bands together to form a circle. Repeat Step 4. Slide both ends of the necklace into the clip and secure.
Until the rye grass takes root – about three days for sodded rye grass and two weeks for seeded rye grass – water your lawn two to three times a week. Your grass should be moist but not saturated. When puddles begin to appear after you water, you can cease watering regularly and proceed only as needed., Applying a fertilizer high in nitrogen helps the rye grass grow. It’s also great if you’ve overseeded an existing lawn and will be using it later to grow vegetables., Rye grass grows very quickly, which means you’ll need to mow your lawn a few times a week. You should set your mower blade to a high setting.	Water your lawn frequently. Apply a high nitrogen fertilizer. Mow your grass frequently.
Although frowned on, the car could merge into your lane just as you are entering the roundabout, causing an accident.  In multi-lane roundabouts, which usually have three or more possible exits, the lane you choose to drive in is dictated by the kind of turn you want to make:   Occupy the left lane if you decide to turn left, make a U-turn, or go straight. Occupy the right lane if you deice to turn run or go straight. Look for signs indicating the allowed movements for each lane. These signs are usually located above or alongside the road and/or arrows painted on the road itself.  Large trucks have a larger turning radius, making them one of the more dangerous obstacles in a roundabout. Always give them ample room to turn by staying behind them a bit more than you ordinarily would with passenger vehicles.  Never change lanes while in a multi-lane roundabout.  A roundabout is like an intersection, through which traffic is continuously flowing. Stopping in the middle of a roundabout will cause congestion and increase the likelihood of an accident.  If you are cycling through a roundabout, you have two options:   Enter the roundabout as if you were a vehicle. Remain centered in your lane to be most visible and avoid being cut off by other vehicles. If you are uncomfortable riding your bicycle through the roundabout, exit the roadway and use the crosswalks.  If you wish to cross the roundabout as a pedestrian, follow these steps:   Look to your left and cross when there is a safe gap in traffic. Stop when you reach the splitter island. Look to your right and cross when there is a safe gap in traffic.	Remember to yield to both lanes of traffic in a multi-lane roundabout.If you know you'll be turning right, and hence staying in the rightmost lane, but you see an oncoming car in the left lane, wait for it to pass before entering the roundabout. Choose which lane to enter based on which direction you want to exit. Never drive next to, or attempt to pass, a large vehicle or truck on a multi-lane roundabout. Stay in your lane at all times. Never, ever stop in the middle of a roundabout. Navigate the roundabout as a cyclist. Navigate the roundabout as a pedestrian.
When you jack up a portion of the car, the weight of that portion will be centralized into the relatively small space beneath the jack. Because of this, it is essential that you jack your car up on a surface that can support that kind of pressure such as concrete or pavement. It is extremely unsafe to jack a car up on an angle, so it is also very important that you choose a level space.Never, under any circumstances, jack a car up on angled ground. Jacking a car up on a surface that isn’t strong enough can cause the jack to topple over or sink.; , People often find themselves jacking up their car while replacing a flat tire on the road. Whether you’re using an emergency jack or a trolley jack, it’s important to ensure you have enough room to work without putting yourself or others at risk. Make sure you have at least enough room to stand with an outstretched arm toward the jack without coming into contact with a wall or being in the street.You should be able to sit behind your jack without being in the lane of the road. If you do not have sufficient space, find a different area to jack your car up.  Wheel chocks can be purchased, but you can also use a number of things if you don’t have ready access to one. A wheel chock is usually shaped like a small ramp and is placed beneath a tire on the opposite end of the vehicle of the side you are jacking up. Always place the wheel chock on the outside end of the wheel to prevent the vehicle from rolling or shifting as you jack the other side up.One wheel chock will usually suffice, but for added safety, feel free to chock the other wheel opposite the end you’re jacking up as well. If you don’t not want to purchase a wheel chock, you can use anything that will safely prevent the wheel from rolling, such as a large rock or block of wood. Plastic wheel chocks can be purchased at most auto parts stores.  If your car is equipped with an automatic transmission, it should be in park before you jack it up. Putting your car in park prevents the wheels from turning. Remember, however, your car may still shift when in park, so it’s important to utilize wheel chocks in conjunction with placing the vehicle in park.Remember that putting the car in park will lock its drive wheels in place, so a front wheel drive car’s front wheels won’t turn in park, and vice versa for a rear wheel drive vehicle. If your car is equipped with a manual transmission, try putting the car in first gear to prevent it from rolling.  Depending on your vehicle, the parking brake may be a handle in the center console of your car or a pedal on your left side when sitting in the driver’s seat. Pull up on the handle or press down on the pedal to engage the parking brake and prevent your vehicle from rolling while it’s being jacked up.If you are unsure where your parking brake is or how to use it, refer to your car’s owner’s manual for help. The parking brake will lock the rear wheels in place and is of particular importance when jacking up the front of the car.	Find a firm, even space to jack up the car. Ensure you have room to work safely. Insert a wheel chock. Ensure the car is in park. Engage the parking brake.
Dwarf ornamental peppers work best for indoor growing, since many of the large varieties may not have adequate room for their roots to develop in indoor containers.; , Clays like terra cotta can actually draw moisture out of the soil, especially in the warm, bright conditions required for growing chili peppers. These peppers need a lot of moisture to grow and may dehydrate in a clay pot.  While chili peppers thrive on vast amounts of water, a drainage hole prevents too much excess water from gathering and drowning or rotting the roots.  Many containers, especially if previously used, contain hidden bacteria and insect eggs that can sabotage new plant life. Wash your container out with hot water and soap to eliminate most threats.  Garden soil often contains bacteria that can damage your pepper seeds, preventing germination or hindering growth. A multi-purpose compost mix purchased from a local gardening store should do the trick, but the higher quality soil you use, the better your odds are of successfully growing your plants.   Improve the quality of your soil further by mixing in some vermiculite.	Select your chili pepper variety. Opt for a plastic pot over a clay container. Choose a pot with a drainage hole. Sterilize the pot before use. Purchase potting mix.
You don't have to buy expensive paper to create a stencil--you may already have what you need in your kitchen, home office or craft room.   Freezer paper. Freezer paper, also known as grease-proof paper, is available at your local grocery store; it's stocked right next to the tinfoil, plastic wrap and wax paper. Unlike wax paper, which was a waxy finish on both sides, freezer paper has a waxy finish on one side only.  Freezer paper is a good choice if you plan to stencil on fabric (T-shirt, onesie, tote bag). Draw your design on the unwaxed side. After the stencil is cut out, place it waxy-side down on your fabric. Use an iron to gently heat the paper, and it will stick to the fabric's surface, making it easy to then apply the paint.   Tracing paper. Start with tracing paper if you plan to trace the outline of your stencil from an existing design you've found in a book or downloaded from the internet. Tracing paper is thin enough that it's easy to see through it and accurately copy your design. Letter stock. Computer paper and other medium-weight paper can be used to create a stencil. A big plus of this material is that you're likely to already have it on hand. Heavy paper. Cardstock and cardboard make for a sturdier stencil that holds up well with multiple uses. Because this paper is so thick, it's a little more difficult to cut. Be sure your blade is very sharp when working with these papers so that your cuts are clean. Carbon paper. If you've created your stencil on tracing paper but want to transfer it to a sturdier paper, you can use carbon paper to transfer the design.  Place the sturdy paper onto your table. Layer a sheet of carbon paper on top of it. Be sure the matte side of the carbon paper is facing up and the side with the carbon is facing down. Lay your tracing paper design on top of the carbon paper. Retrace the design going over every line and detail. Apply firm pressure as you work to ensure that your design transfers clearly and completely. Remove the tracing paper and the sheet of carbon paper. The design will now be "printed" on your sturdy paper.  It's a good idea to make your stencil as strong as possible so that it stands up well for your project and allows you the option of reusing it in the future.  Cover the stencil in contact paper. Clear contact paper is readily available in the housewares department of your local hardware or discount store.       Place your stencil flat on a nonporous surface. You don't want to accidentally remove the finish from a table by having it come into contact with the sticky paper. Cut a piece of contact paper the size of your stencil, remove the backing and stick it to the stencil. Trim away any excess.   Use packing tape. Place your stencil design-side down on a nonporous surface. Run strips of packing tape over the stencil. Overlap each strip with the next until the entire surface is covered. Run the tape past the edges of the paper and trim the excess        , If you're drawing, you may want to start by working in pencil. Once you have the design how you want it, retrace your pencil lines with a fine to medium point permanent marker. If you're tracing a design, you can use a marker to begin with.   If you've created multiple lines while making your initial pencil drawing, be clear on what the final outline should be before going over it in ink.  Because of its delicate nature, cutting paper requires a sharp blade and significant patience. Trying to move too quickly can result in rips and tears that will mean redrawing your stencil and starting again.   Secure your stencil in place. Use masking tape to secure the edges of your paper stencil firmly in place on your cutting surface. You could also use small bits of poster gum to get the paper to stick to the work surfaced. To make sure you have contact between the paper and the surface, use only a small amount of the gum and thoroughly flatten it out. Use a sharp, new blade in your cutting knife and remove the areas of your stencil where you plan to apply paint or ink. Do not cut out your bridges--those borders that separate one section of your stencil image from the other. If your stencil is particularly large or your using heavier paper, you may have to replace your blade mid-project; do so as soon as the blade seems dull to prevent it from dragging and tearing your paper. When making long cuts, hold hold your knife at a lower angle and further away from your blade. As you move around your stencil, turn the paper not your hand. To create sharp edges, cut away from corners not into them. Use tweezers and a sharp knife to remove the cut stencil pieces. When you've finished, peel up the tape by its edges. If you can't remove it from the paper stencil without it ripping, simply fold it over onto the back. If you used poster gum, work from one corner and remove the gum from the back of your stencil.  If you notice that one of your cuts did not go all the way through, immediately put the plastic back on, re-secure it to the surface and go over the intact area with your blade.	Choose your material. Reinforce your stencil. Draw or trace your stencil design. Cut out the stencil.
Ask them to get some for you if they don't have any in stock.   If you know someone with the plant, take pieces of it. They can be detached easily and simply potted to grow new ones.; , It tolerates good light or slight shade. It also needs a mild climate.   If wished, grow in the pots (containers) of tall plants to act as cover over the compost given to the that plant. It is happy growing with other plants.  If it gets too soaked, it risks rotting and getting mouldy.  It needs little help as it is fairly vigorous. It won't do well if you place it into too humid an environment or where the ventilation is poor. Do not over-feed it.	Find the plant at your local nursery or garden centre. Position the plant in a cool and airy spot. Keep the plant moist but not over watered. Don't worry too much about the care needs of this plant.
Obtaining the exact amount of money owed on your car loan will allow you to make financial plans regarding paying off the loan. If you do online banking, this information can be found under your account summary. Alternately, you can review your mailed monthly statement.; , You can request this from your financial institution in person or by logging in to your personal account on your lender's website. Speak directly with a loan adviser or review the terms and conditions of your loan to determine if penalties apply for paying the car loan off quickly.   Some banks or financial institutions may charge you fees or penalties for paying off the car loan sooner than the original life of the loan, especially if you cause them to lose money in interest. These are typically called "prepayment penalties."  , You can find online loan payoff calculators at Bankrate.com or MortgageLoan.com where you can plug in your loan's interest rate, monthly payment and payoff amount. Then you will be able to compare how much you can save by paying the car off in one lump sum, making payments twice a month, or increasing the amount of your monthly payments.If there are penalties for paying off your car loan early, compare the savings you calculated with the amount of the penalties. Then you will know if you will save money by paying off your loan early.  Your loan adviser may be able to educate you on the most beneficial way for you to pay off your car loan faster, especially if penalties apply. For example, ask your lender if they can decrease the balance of your car loan if you can pay the remaining balance in one lump sum.In some cases, lenders may lower the remaining balance of your car loan substantially if you can pay off the remaining balance with just one payment.  Some lenders may only charge you a fixed monthly interest, which can allow you to apply additional payments toward the principal amount. However, other lenders may charge you interest on every payment you make. Ask your lender if you can make additional payments toward the principal amount of the loan without having to pay interest. If so, you can plan to make small, additional payments toward the loan each month and pay less in interest over the life of the loan.   An example of the difference between the kinds of interest you pay is: if you have a $100 payment due every month with $4 interest that means you pay $104 per month. What you need to find out is if that $4 is a fixed amount per month, which would mean no matter how much you might pay on the principal ($100, $200, $300) you still pay just $4 monthly interest. If, however, they charge interest on every payment, you would end up paying 4% interest on whatever you are putting down on the principal -- $8 if you chose to pay $200 instead of $100, for example. Even if you have to pay interest on each payment, it is usually worth your while to make extra principal payments to pay your loan off faster.  Use a check or pay online to make an extra payment per month, that is separate from your regular car loan payment. Write “Principal Only” on the check so that the lender will not count it toward your loan payment for the next month.If you are paying online, pay the extra principal amount before you are billed for the next month.  Instead of making one monthly payment, split it in half and make payments every two weeks. This typically works out to twice per month, but by the end of the year you will have made two more biweekly payments (one full payment) because most months are longer than an exact 4 weeks. In other words, make 26 half payments per year (every other week for 52 weeks) that will equal 13 full payments, rather than the 12 you would've otherwise paid. This means that the total amount you owe will go down faster, saving you interest on the loan., Extra income such as tax refunds, bonuses from your job, or cash gifts from birthdays or holidays could be applied to your car loan, resulting in a faster payoff. You will be paying more in interest on your car loan than you would earn in a savings or money market account., If you have the time outside your normal work hours, consider starting a side business in order to generate additional money to pay down your car loan. Examples of side businesses are:   Rent out a room in your home. This could be for a student or someone staying in your town temporarily for a job. You can advertise this on your local craigslist.com. Mow lawns and/or shovel snow. Run errands for elderly people or busy professionals. Buy china, artwork, tools, jewelry, books, etc. for low prices at estate sales and flea markets and then sell them on eBay. Offer at-home party sales. Check out Tupperware, Pampered Chef, Longaberger baskets, Silpada jewelry, Mary Kay cosmetics, Cabi clothing and The Happy Gardener. If you organize a sales team you’ll be able to reap a percent of their profits as well.  If you have paid off one of your credit cards, for example, continue to pay that former monthly amount toward your car loan. Then you won't be tempted to spend it on other things.  Make a list of your monthly income and expenses, including expenses that occur only once or twice a year. Then you will be able to see if you have extra cash at the end of the month to pay down your car loan. If you don't have extra cash, look for areas where you can cut expenses.Eliminate expenses you do not need such as cable television channels or a landline telephone. The money you apply to costs such as these can be applied toward your car loan instead. Seek lower rates on mandatory expenses and bills such as auto insurance, internet bills, or cell phone bills by consulting with each of your service providers for bundled or promotional rates. You can get auto insurance quotes online to compare to your current policy. Lower your food expenses by cooking or preparing meals at home rather than eating out in restaurants. In most cases, a specific meal will cost significantly more if you purchase it from a restaurant than if you buy the meal or ingredients from a grocery store.  Banks will often have much better deals than car dealerships, so look at the loans offered at your bank. Talk to a bank employee about how the loans work, how much interest and what kind they charge, and if there are prepayment penalties. If you choose to take out a car loan with your bank, make sure to take the information about the bank and the loan to the car dealership so that they have the information.  Now that you've learned how to pay off a car loan faster, you know how detrimental it is if there are prepayment penalties. There are many choices of where to take out a car loan, so next time make sure you choose a financial institution that does not require prepayment penalties.  The fastest way to pay off a loan is to not take one out in the first place. If you were paying $300 a month for your car loan and the loan is now paid off, continue to put this amount in a savings or money market account. Then when you are ready to buy your next car you can pay in cash for a large down payment or the entire amount.  If you have started to make and follow a budget while cutting expenses, keep up these good habits. Put any money you save into a money market account to earn interest. Or if you don't plan on buying a new car for 3-5 years, you could invest this money in a certificate of deposit (CD). Then you will be able to make a large down payment or not have to take out a loan for your next car.	Determine the exact payoff amount of your car loan. Obtain a copy of your bank or loan agreement. Calculate savings as a result of making extra payments. Consult with your financial institution for loan payoff recommendations. Determine if you can make additional payments to the principal balance only. Make a separate payment for principal. Make biweekly payments. Apply extra earnings or cash gifts to your car loan. Earn extra income. Use the snowball technique. Establish a budget and minimize extra expenses. Ask about car loans at your bank. Don't take out a car loan with prepayment penalties. Continue paying yourself the monthly car payment. Continue to budget and cut expenses.
Some leaks can be repaired, but leaks on the shoulder or sidewall of the tire should never be repaired. If you have a puncture in the tread area that is less than 1/4" in diameter then a repair may be your best option. If you are unsure of whether to replace or repair the tire consult a professional., Some people prefer to fix leaks on their own. To do this you can patch your tire, or for smaller leaks you can use a tire sealant such as Fix-A-Flat for a temporary fix.  If you aren't able to fix the leak yourself you should take it to a professional tire shop. If it is a slow leak it may be safe for you to pump the tire up and drive to the shop. Otherwise, it may be necessary to have your car towed to the tire shop.	Determine the severity of the leak. Fix the leak yourself. Take your vehicle to a professional.
Since retailers have to pay a fee to credit card companies when consumers charge a purchase, some will offer a discount to customers who pay cash. Check to see if the store you're in has a policy posted about this. If it doesn't, ask to speak to a manager about a cash discount.; , Credit cards are a common method of payment for appliance purchases. If you plan to pay the balance off when the bill comes, choose a card with a rewards program. If you plan to pay over time, use the card that offers the lowest interest rate available to you.  Asking for gift cards to a store that sells refrigerators for gift-giving occasions is an effective way to save up for an appliance purchase. If your credit card has a rewards program, you might also find that you can cash in your points for gift cards to a variety of retailers, including several that sell refrigerators. Some airline frequent flier points also can be cashed in for retail gift cards.  Although layaway programs are less common than they used to be, there are still appliance retailers that offer them. Layaway programs typically allow you to pay a down payment, then make payments on a fixed schedule (usually every week or 2). Once the item has been paid for, you're free to take it home. Be sure to read the rules carefully to ensure you understand what fees are involved in your layaway purchase.  Some retailers (especially independent stores) are willing to barter for goods or services. If you have a skill or a product that might be of use to the owner of an appliance store, offer an exchange for the refrigerator, or a discount or upgrade on your purchase. Perhaps you can write an employee handbook, fix a computer or design a new logo for the store. Be sure to research the tax implications of your trade before you finalize the deal.

Make sure that there's no car behind you before you try to parallel park. If there is a car behind you, wait for it to pass or pull into a driveway or side-street ahead, and then approach the spot again.  This will let other cars know that you're parking.  Shift your transmission down so that you approach the spot at no more than 2–3 mph (3.2–4.8 km/h). If you're driving an automatic car, just lightly press the brake, and if you're driving a manual car, shift down to a lower gear and lightly press the brake.  It should be at least a foot apart from the car. If it's too close, then you may hit the car when you start moving backward. , Continue to check your mirrors and blind spots to make sure that the coast is still clear. Turn around before you begin to move backwards. , If you're driving an automatic car, that's all you need to do. If you're driving a manual car, then you should slowly let go of the clutch as you press the gas. If you're parking on a hill, then you can keep pressing the clutch and just slowly move your foot off the brake. , Continue to back up until you're fully in the space. You may not get it on your first try. You can move back and steer your wheel away from the curb, then move forward again while steering your wheel toward the curb, and repeat this process until you've got it right.  Shift it into First Gear if you're driving a manual car, and shift the car into Park if you're driving Pull forward until you're evenly positioned between the car in front of you and the car behind you.  Keep your foot on the brake as you turn your wheels in the right direction. If you're pulling into a flat spot, just straighten your wheels. If you've parked uphill, you can turn your wheels away from the curb, and if you've parked downhill, you can turn your wheels toward the curb. This will keep your car from rolling away if your brakes are disengaged.  Pull forward until you're evenly positioned between the car in front of you and the car behind you.	Check your rear-view mirrors. Turn on your signal. Slow down your car. Pull your car so that it's parallel with the car in front of the open space. Shift into Reverse (R).  , Back up. Turn your wheel toward the curb.  , Lightly press the gas. Move the car backward until it's halfway in the parking space.  , Steer your wheel away from the curb. Park the car. Turn your wheels in the right direction. Shift into First Gear. Pull up your parking brake.
Over time, components of your suspension can wear out. While visually inspecting components can often let you know if they’ve become compromised, the easiest way to determine if you are having a suspension issue is by paying attention to how the ride in your vehicle feels. If it has become progressively rougher, it is likely because the suspension is no longer absorbing the bumps the way it is supposed to.If you begin to feel more bumps and shakes as you drive, there may be an issue with your suspension. Sometimes a rougher ride will come coupled with audible squeaks as the suspension struggles to manage bumps in the road.; , If you begin to feel as though the vehicle is working against you as you turn, it is likely the result of a failing suspension component. Different parts of your suspension can affect the steering response, angle of the tires, and the center of balance of the vehicle. Each of these elements can make your vehicle cumbersome or difficult to turn. A bad tie rod end will make steering response sluggish. If you’re an audible creek while turning the wheel, it may be the result of a bad lower ball joint. Conversely, if you hear knocking as the weight transfers in the vehicle during a turn, it may be caused by a bad sway bar end link.Pay attention to how the vehicle reacts as you turn and compare it to your previous experiences in the vehicle to assess if there is an issue. Listen carefully to see if components of your suspension are squeaking under pressure. Every vehicle behaves a little differently while turning, so previous experiences with the vehicle can make assessing issues much easier.  Your tires should wear fairly evenly across the width of the tread. If you rotate your tires regularly, they should be worn close to evenly throughout. If you happen to notice the inside or outside of the tire is wearing at a faster rate than the rest, it could be an issue with the camber of your wheels and tires. Camber is the term used to describe the angle the wheel sits in relation to the vehicle and road.A vehicle with negative camber will wear the inside of the tires more quickly. A vehicle with positive camber will wear the outsides of the tires more quickly. Camber is determined by your suspension components and wheel alignment.  If you are having issues with your front struts or shocks, your suspension may struggle to keep the vehicle level under hard braking. Stop quickly in a safe area and pay attention to the front of your car. If the nose of the vehicle dives or drops as you slow down, it may be as result of bad shocks or struts. If you can hear an audible clunk from the front of the vehicle as you brake, there is either an issue with your control arm or sub frame bushing.Your suspension should be able to support the weight of your vehicle and keep it fairly level during most situations. The front corner of your vehicle may also drop as you turn in the same direction. This is caused by the same failure.  With the vehicle parked, walk around it and visually assess how level it seems to be sitting. If one side of the car rests higher than the other, there are likely worn out or broken suspension components to blame.It is not uncommon for the front of the vehicle to ride slightly lower than the rear in many vehicles such as pickup trucks, but the vehicle should otherwise be level.  Your vehicle should have no difficulty withstanding bumps in the road at low speeds. If you go over a bump and feel your vehicle sway back and forth or bounce after passing the bump, your suspension is struggling to support the weight of the vehicle.Your vehicle should be able to go over a bump and quickly regain composure at low speeds. If your vehicle sways back and forth after going over a bump, there is likely an issue with your suspension.	Pay attention if your ride begins to feel rougher. Take note if your vehicle pulls or squeaks during turns. Inspect the tread wear on your tires. Try braking abruptly to see if the nose dives as you stop. Look to see if the vehicle sits level. Pay attention to swaying and bouncing at low speeds.
Plaster of Paris can be purchased from many craft stores. Mix 1 cup of plaster compound with ½ cup water.This should provide enough plaster for several eggs. Stir the mixture until it has a smooth and creamy texture, like a thin milkshake.   Do not pour excess plaster of Paris down the drain, as it can harden and clog pipes.; , Make sure to insert the end of the funnel far enough into a balloon so that it won’t fall out or spill the plaster.   Alternatively, you could fill a clean squeeze bottle with plaster of Paris so that you can squirt it into the balloon.  Fill the balloon until it is nice and round. Be careful not to fill the balloon so much that it can burst.  Close the end of the balloon with a tight not and/or tie it closed with a piece of string.  This ensures that you do not have a dinosaur egg that is flat on one side. The setting process may take up to several hours (follow the plaster of Paris package instructions for details).  Carefully cut or peel the rest of the balloon off. Smooth out any rough spots with sandpaper.  Then, you can decorate them with paint, glitter, etc. Have fun and use your imagination!	Mix the plaster. Insert a funnel into the end of a balloon.Regular latex balloons and an ordinary kitchen funnel will work just fine. Put the plaster inside the balloon.Carefully spoon the plaster of Paris mixture into the funnel so that it pours into the balloon (or use a squeeze bottle to fill it). Tie the balloon.Remove the funnel, taking care not to spill the plaster out of the balloon. Float the balloon.Place the tied-up balloon in a bucket of water while the plaster of Paris sets. Cut away the balloon.Dry the balloon and cut the end off. Decorate your eggs.Let the plaster of Paris eggs dry for about 24 hours.
If your pattern requires darts, which are usually used in fitted bodice patterns, (sometimes both front and back) it is essential for the darts to be done accurately. As tedious as ironing open seams can be, it is a total requirement for the bodice, so turn that iron on and have it ready. Darts should be done FIRST. No cheating on using the markers, whether using a roller and colored transfer paper or using tailor pencils or chalk, it is really important to mark the beginning, middle and end of where the dart is located. Remember, one quarter inch can make the difference in whether a bodice fits or not. Use accurate fold and mark. Measure both darts to verify they are the same length. Slow as you go sewing is used for darts, I prefer not to back stitch, but leaving the threads long on the top and bottom of darts. Once sewed and measured (tried on) for accuracy I then tie the ends into a knot and clip. Iron the dart as indicated (usually to the outside.) When the front and back have been connected by shoulder seams, try it on with the bra you plan on wearing with the garment. By doing this it will be evident that the darts are correct, then when you sew the side seams, you will be comfortable with the fit. If you don't like where the darts are fitting, this is where you can make the adjustments, re-do the darts.  Again, it is SO IMPORTANT that the darts match. Whatever adjustments you made to your garment, you should make to the lining in the same way. When the lining is fit to the main garment, it should become as one with the main material., When working with facings for necklines as well as armholes, it is essential to use the method of basting to "fit" the material of the facing to the main bodice. By doing this, it will reduce the puckering that can occur with facings. When "turning under raw edge" use the slow sew method unless using a serger to make the raw edge hemmed. Hemming a curved edge when turning under 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) requires making slight folds as you go along to make sure the facing is not puckering or ruffled so that it lays flat on the inside of the bodice. Make sure to iron facing before attaching to main garment. Marking the facings to fit the neckline is as important as making good darts, so don't ignore the circle or triangle markings. Match the facings to the bodice at indicated markings and use a good seam length to insure a tight connection. Iron the seams open first, then iron to the entire facing to the inside of the garment. An old 'trick' was to sew the seam to the facing side to insure the seam stayed down. This can still be done with fabric that holds up to the extra seam. Don't use this with fabrics that can't hold up to the extra seams. (some chiffons, silks and light weave cottons) Facings as well as linings should not be noticeable at all. Again, "try-on" the front and back once the shoulders are sewed together to determine just how fitted you want the sides as well as underarms., This procedure is great if you do not have a machine that has removable plate for a small armhole circle. This is easiest for sleeves that have very gathered sleeves at the top. Gather the sleeves using double seam gathering method and pull threads evenly to ensure gathers are fit between markings. Sew the top of the sleeve to the armhole at the top. Finish the bottom of the sleeve first, hem and then starting as the bottom of the sleeve, slowly start sewing up to the armhole then continue with a slight U turn of the machine to sew down the side-seam of the bodice. You can go back and sew the U again to fortify the seam. This particular way of sewing sleeves and side-seams in one continuing motion can save time and help in making a well fit sleeve and underarm. (Really important for comfort.), Hemming is extremely important especially if the blouse is to be worn outside of the lower garment. Make it look finished! If you are making a jersey top and you are using serger for edges, then use that for finishing. If using a fancier pattern and material, then hem it proper!!, This is really the last place you want any puckering, whether in the front or in the back. Take care to make sure that any gathering required of the top of the skirt or pant is done with the same care as the sleeve gathering. Gathers at the waist need to be done very evenly so that it is not bulky!! Make sure to 'try-on' prior to sewing top to bottom to verify the waist is actually on your waistline! (especially if you did NOT fit pattern to your own measurements prior to starting project) You have worked so hard to make sure your Bodice part of the project is perfect, so take the time to make sure the attachment to the bottom is done with the same care. Follow instructions to finish your project., If you are comfortable, confident and you feel pretty, you look pretty!	One of the most important items in the construction of a bodice is the fit and location of required darts. At this point, many patterns will require that if there is a lining, you would repeat the same thing for the lining. If a lining is not used but a facing is used for neck and arms, this is where you will be working on those pieces. Most blouses call for side seams then sleeves, but sleeves can be fit into armholes prior to sewing side seams. Now if this is the end of your blouse, all that is left is the finish work of hem, buttons, hook and eye or whatever is called for. If you are attaching your bodice to a lower portion (skirt or pant) of the pattern this is where you will make sure that the waistline is as perfect as you can get it. Other than jewels, nothing makes a girl feel prettier than a nice fitting garment.
For any pesticide use, the label will tell you:   Specific purpose of the herbicide. Level of toxicity, with "caution" being the least toxic and "danger" the most toxic. Pesticide safety information. Protective clothing and equipment needed for weed killer application. Instructions for pesticide use, storage and disposal.; ,   Do not wash protective clothing used to apply herbicides with other laundry.  This may include dusters, sprayers or granular applicators.   Check for leaking connections or nozzles. You can also choose ready-to-use herbicides, such as sprays or aerosols to apply herbicides.    Mix only the amount that is needed. You should not store mixed herbicides. Calibrate equipment before weed killer application.    Much of the danger of pesticide use comes from breezy days that cause particle drift. Never apply herbicides when it's windy and stop if the wind picks up. Mornings and evenings are usually better times of day for weed killer application.    Spray so you don't have to walk or step in application areas. Follow specific label directions for application. Use all of mixed herbicide.    Rinse spray equipment and flush hoses and nozzles. Wash yourself, clothing and protective equipment. Remove clothing before washing face, hands and body.    Avoid having to dispose of any pesticide by buying only what you need. If you must dispose of herbicides, contact a waste collection program. Rinse empty herbicide containers before wrapping in newspapers and sending to a sanitary landfill.  General procedures include:   Rinsing skin immediately if herbicide gets on it. Moving to fresh air if an herbicide has been inhaled. Have the container with you if you must seek medical help or contact a poison control center.	Read the label carefully before you apply herbicides. Wear protective clothing and equipment mentioned on the label, such as goggles, gloves, etc. Make certain you have the correct equipment for weed killer application. Mix herbicide for pesticide use according to the label, using the exact proportions. Choose the best day and time of day for pesticide safety in weed killer application. Apply herbicides in a continuous manner with little overlap. Clean up after weed killer application. Store herbicides in original containers in a locked cabinet away from temperature extremes and away from children and pets. Know what first aid procedures are required by reading the "Statement of Practical Treatment" on the pesticide label ahead of time.
Keep them in a drawer, sack or small container throughout the year, so that you will have enough to mark your plants when spring arrives.   If you do not drink wine, then you can buy wine corks at a home brew/fermentation supply store.; , Gather enough wine corks for all of your herb plants. Keep a few extra corks on hand, in case you make a mistake.  Other colors of marker will not show up as boldly on a cork. Ask someone with good or elaborate handwriting to write on your corks, if you do not like your own handwriting.   You may want to write the name of the herb on both sides of the cork to make it easy to see from both sides.  Place the cork on top of a surface instead of holding it in your hand while you drill. Drill approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep into the center of the bottom of the cork.   Make sure you drill from the bottom of the word toward the top. This will allow the writing to be read from left to right when it is in the garden.  Push it into the cork firmly, until it feels very secure.  You want to insert them securely into the soil, but they do not need to reach the bottom.	Collect corks from wine bottles as you drink them. Create a list of all your herb plants. Take a fine-point black permanent marker and write the name of each herb on a cork. Find a small bit, approximately the size of a barbecue skewer, to put on a handheld drill. Place a wooden barbecue skewer into each wine cork. Cut the barbecue skewers to a shorter length, if they are too long.
Each style has a different feel. For instance, the quick beats of tap dancing are very different from the long graceful moves of ballet dancing or the edgy movements of hiphop. Perhaps you could try ballroom dancing with a partner or even Irish dancing., Try watching different videos to understand the basics of different styles of dance. Maybe you don't have strong enough knees for tap dancing. Maybe you don't like how your feet need to bend in ballet dancing. See what draws you in.  These books describe the basics of dancing, so they give you an idea of what you have ahead of you.   Try checking out magazines from the library. It's a free way to explore your options. Dive into the history of dances. It may inspire you to choose one.  Go see a live show in your local community. It doesn't have to be an expensive. Maybe your local college has a dance school. However, watching in person provides a different experience than watching a video. It sweeps you up in the performance.If you watch someone dance, you'll get a better feel for dancing. You'll see some great moves and get ideas from the pros. If you can't afford a live performance, try checking out movies with dancing, such as musicals. Pay attention to the dancers to see what they are doing. Are they focused? What is their technique like? Do their emotions complement the music? If you notice what inspires you in their movement, it may help you decide what you want to do.  Many communities offer introductory dance classes. They can introduce you to variety of types at once. Check out your parks and recreation department or library.   If your community doesn't offer them, check out your local community colleges. Classes at community colleges are cheap.  If you have good posture and can stretch your legs and point your toes, try classical ballet, not hip hop. When you research dances, make sure you know the body placements. See which ones you think you can do well. Always bear in mind, though, that you are learning. You can and will develop greater flexibility.  While you can always branch out later, start with one type of dance first. Focus on learning that type of dancing before you move on to anything else.  You need space to practice. Choose somewhere with a solid floor where you can make some noise.  Many songs have dance remixes, but you can move to almost anything that has a steady beat.  Some people have trouble hearing the beat. If that's you, try listening to the music at the beginning of a song. Ask someone who knows music to help you count the beats, tapping your foot in time. Once you get the hang of it, you can do it on your own., Once you feel the beat, try moving your body to it. You can worry about technique later. At this point in time, you just want to learn to move your body in time to the beat.You may want to start out by moving just your arms, then adding leg movements (or vice versa). It's easier to focus on one part. Really listen to the beat to be on time with the moves.  Of course you want to immediately be an awesome dancer. However, dancing takes time to learn. If you try too much too soon, you could hurt yourself.  Starting at the beginning will help you avoid frustration. It will improve your technique for more complicated moves. Use online tutorials or books to help you learn the basics.   For ballet, try the basic positions. For instance, begin in first position. First position is where your heels are together, but each foot points straight out to the side. It may take awhile to achieve this turnout, but use your hips to help you get into this position. Your arms should curve out from your shoulders in an arch., Dance clubs are a great place to try out certain types of dance moves, such as hip hop, country, or swing dancing.  You may have taken a dance class to choose a genre, but now you should take one focused on the type of dance (or dances) you love. Once again, look for community classes or try your local community college. Pick a beginner class, since you're still learning.  Watching professionals helps create a map in your brain. Essentially, by watching their movements, you are better able to make the movement yourself because your brain has already gone through the motions.You can take in a local performance, as above. Also, pay close attention to your instructor as she shows you how to make the movements.  If you get friends to take the class together with you, you can spend time outside of class practicing together. That way, you can also provide feedback for each other. You can work on improving together., The only way to train your body is to practice on a regular basis. It will help your body develop muscle memory, so you can dance without having to think through the motions., Take a video of yourself, and watch it to see how you are moving. You can also try posting it on dancing sites to ask for tips from other dancers., Practicing in front of a mirror will let you see what you're doing wrong in real time, so that you're not practicing a move that's wrong., Check for local theater companies, and try out for one. You can also see if your community has any local dance groups you could join.   One way to find these types of groups is to check event listings in your newspaper. You can see who's performing to find local groups.  These foods pack a punch when it comes to nutrients. Your body needs those vitamins and minerals to function properly, so eat your greens every day., If you're dancing constantly, you should get about half of your calories from carbohydrates. The other 50 percent should be split, with about 35 percent going to fat and 15 percent going to protein.The carbohydrates fuel your muscles for dancing, giving you energy. Protein helps rebuild your muscles. In intense dance sessions, your muscles are stressed and the fibers break, which protein helps fix., Avoid white sugar, white bread, and white rice. Instead, choose whole grains and fruits for your carbohydrates., You need to replenish the fluids that your body is losing. In addition, being dehydrated can slow you down.Aim for 8 glasses of water a day that are 8 ounces each. In an intense dance session, you should drink about 4 glasses of water per hour. to help make up for fluid loss., Try fish or chicken as your protein, as they are lower in saturated fat than red meats. You can also enjoy proteins from plants, such as nuts and beans., To help develop your body, try other exercises to increase your muscles and stamina.   For instance, swimming is a great all-body workout that can improve your flexibility. It also takes the stress off your joints. The backstroke is especially good if you need to loosen your upper body.To develop your leg muscles, try cycling. It's also a great way to increase your overall endurance. Make sure you sit up straight when riding because otherwise you can shorten muscles near the hips.For flexibility and strength, take a yoga class. Yoga can help lengthen your muscles, as well as strengthen your core., Lifting weights helps you to develop your muscles. You'll be able to stay in certain dance positions for longer, or move in ways you didn't think you could. You can do standard weightlifting such as bicep curls or leg squats, but only do sets of three with six or eight repetitions with a slightly heavier weight than you would normally use. More weight (but not as many repetitions) will help strengthen your body without adding too much weight in muscles to your body.For a bicep curl, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your palm should be facing inwards towards your body. Lift both arms slightly so that your palms are facing upwards. Alternate lifting each arm to your shoulder.For squats, stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Hold dumbbells in front of your body. Bend your knees at the same time, lowering yourself down, and then return to standing. Repeat the exercise.	Know what styles to explore. Watch dance videos online. Look at dance magazines and books. Watch professionals. Join a community dance class. Know your limitations. Choose your favorite type of dance. Find an open space to practice. Use music with a good beat. Learn to hear the beat. Don't be afraid to move. Dance at your own pace. Learn the basics first. Go dancing at a club. Join a local dance class. Watch professionals. Practice with friends. Set aside time specifically for practice. See how you're doing. Practice in front of a mirror. Go out in the community. Eat your vegetables and fruits. Know the proportions. Avoid simple carbohydrates. Hydrate your body. Choose lean proteins. Try cross-training or TRX. Lift weights.
It's okay if not everything matches perfectly or if you mix prints.; , Pay attention at orientation and ask current students there for any tips.  Regular twin size sheets or full sheets will not fit!  , Because you have so little space in your dorm, your bed is also your couch, your office... and your dinner table. Getting bedding with dark colors or prints makes it easier to camouflage any spills or stains.  A sheet set includes pillowcases, a flat sheet, and a fitted sheet. You aren't going to want to do laundry very often but your sheets do need to be changed, so don't wait until Thanksgiving break to come home and ask Mom to wash your sheets. Two sets is probably the minimum: that way, you can have one set on your bed and one clean set.  Because your college has to outfit so many dorms, you can guarantee that your mattress won't be the most comfortable one you've ever slept on.  If you're going to University of Las Vegas, you might not need a heavy comforter all year round. On the other hand, if you're going to University of Maine, you might want a comforter as well as a few lighter blankets.  It goes over your comforter and usually closes with a zipper or Velcro. When it needs to be washed, just pull the cover off and throw it in the machine.  During the warmer months, you can store your comforter (and winter clothes!) under your bed. Or, you can bring your winter stuff home when you come to visit. Always leave a fleece throw or two in your dorm, in case the air conditioning is cranked up one day.  They might have a comforter folded up in a closet somewhere. You might not want to bring the bedding from your bed at home to school with you; that way when you come home, you'll still have something to sleep in.  If you want, you can try to coordinate.	Remember that college is the first (and probably last) time you will live essentially on your own before entering "the adult work world.", Read any dorm guidelines that your school sends you. The most important rule of buying bedding for your dorm is getting twin extra-long sheets. Don't get white bedding. Buy more than one set of sheets. Buy a mattress pad. Take the climate of your school into account. Instead of trying to figure out how to put a comforter in the washing machine, consider a duvet cover. Invest in under-bed storage. Ask your parents if they have any spare bedding things lying around. If it's important to you, get in touch with your roommate(s) before buying bedding.
Do you just want a costume to wear around town, for fun, or do you want to wear it to an Anime Convention or other big event? If it's your first time cosplaying you may want to choose a character with a simpler outfit. However, if you do not mind strange stares and/or possible harassment, then feel free to go all out. For the latter, any costume will work, although unique costumes are more likely to stand out.; , Consider your budget and time allowance. If you're short on time, making your costume from scratch may not be the best idea. Keep in mind that makeup and getting the perfect hairdo (regardless if it's your own hair or a wig) also takes time.  For example, if your character is wearing a jacket and pants; what color are they? Which kind of fabric should you use? Are the clothes baggy or tight?  , Study your character's hair, eye color, and shape of face. Shall you use a wig or not? How should you style your hair? What kind of make up would be fitting and make your face look more like the character? Do you need colored lenses? It would be a good idea to read a little about how to change the shape of your face with make up. Don't forget props.  It gives you a good view on how the character really looks. Write up your measurements on the sketch and try to figure out what the costumes measurements should be. If the character has any props, a weapon or just a bag for example, sketch them up too.  The more difficult and detailed the costume is, the more time you'll need to make it. Give yourself more time than you think you need and be really realistic. Also, give yourself a little extra time to fix any eventual mistakes. It's better to have it done early than to have an unfinished costume. Decide in what order you should make everything you need.  It will take time to make it good, so be patient and try different methods and products.  Do you look like the character/person? If no, try to figure out why and consider making some changes. It's a good idea to ask a friend or someone else you trust if you look like the character and what you could change. Tell them to be honest, that's why you're asking.  If you want, you could practice poses the character does a lot. You could also study the way the character walk and/or move, and try to imitate it. It's completely optional.  Whether you're walking around town, at a party, or a convention, make sure you're having fun with it!  , If you don't have fun, you're not cosplaying the right way!	Decide who you want to cosplay. Decide how you want to go about getting your costume. If you have decided a character/person to cosplay and choose to make the costume yourself; it's a good start to make a list of what you have to make, how you shall make it and what you need to buy in order to make it. No matter if you buy the costume, you probably have hair, make up and maybe even lenses to buy and fix. It helps to sketch up your character from different angles. Decide how much time (and money) you should spend on making the costume. Practice on the make up, putting in and taking out the lenses and fixing your hair (or the wig). When everything is done, put everything on and look in the mirror. Be confident cosplaying. Make your grand debut!, Have fun with it!
The right amount will depend on the sort of display you want to create. Large arrangements require 8 to 12 tulips, but smaller arrangements may only need three to six. You can also display single tulips.   It may also help to know which vase or container you plan to use before purchasing your tulips. Ideally, the tulip stems should fit snugly inside the mouth of the container without being squeezed together.; , Tulips come in a fairly wide range of colors, and your arrangement can include one or more of these colors.   For home decor purposes, most people prefer to choose colors that coordinate well with the colors of the room. You can use tulips to draw out an accent color already in the room or to add contrast to the colors of that room. For instance, red tulips might look nice in a bedroom with red throw pillows and neutral walls. On the other hand, bright orange tulips can add a pleasant splash of complementary contrast to a room decorated in nothing but shades of blue. Another option is to choose the color based on meaning. In the language of flowers, each tulip color carries a slightly different meaning.Red tulips are a declaration of love and mean "please believe me." Yellow tulips once signified hopeless love but now state, "there's sunshine in your smile." White tulips can symbolize forgiveness, heaven, novelty, and purity. Cream tulips say, "I will love you forever." Purple tulips symbolize wealth and royalty. Pink tulips symbolize deep affection. Orange tulips stand for energy, desire, and passion. Variegated tulips state, "you have beautiful eyes."    , Your tulip arrangement will last longer if you start with tulips that still have closed buds with only a hint of color showing—just enough to let you see what color you're actually purchasing.   Tulips that have already begun opening can still create a nice display for a day or two, but since they're further along in their lifecycle, these tulips will not last as long in an arrangement.  The cut should be made diagonally so that the stems can draw up more water.   As stems dry, they gradually close up, restricting their ability to draw in water. Making a fresh cut re-opens the stem and makes it easier for the tulip to drink. You can lay the tulips flat as you do this, but cutting the stems under still or running water is recommended to prevent air from entering the fresh cut and blocking the water channels inside the stem.  At minimum, you should remove the bottom leaf of each stem. You can remove more leaves, as desired, to change the appearance of the arrangement.   When creating medium to large arrangements, you'll usually want to remove all but the top leaf from each stem. The single leaf provides just enough volume and greenery to make the arrangement look full, but too many leaves can distract from the appearance of the tulip blossoms. Any leaves you leave behind should be inspected for dirt. Brush or wash away any hidden debris trapped along the inside of the leaves. To remove the leaves, simply pull each leaf back and gently peel it off the stem.  Before arranging your tulips, it can be a good idea to train the stems so that they stand strong and upright.Roll the bouquet of tulips in a snug newspaper or wax paper cone. The paper should rise above the tops of the tulips, but roughly one-third of the lower stems should be left uncovered. Place the wrapped bouquet in a clean container of cool water. The water should be deep enough to cover the exposed stems. Let the tulips remain in this position for one or two hours. Afterward, remove them from the paper cone and arrange as desired. Note that you can also do this periodically throughout the lifespan of the tulips once they start drooping inside their arrangement.  Tulips can look great in wide range of containers. You can use a traditional vase or experiment with a recycled option.Keep the size in mind when selecting a container. Large arrangements do best in containers that are tall and wide, while smaller arrangements are best when constrained in short or narrow containers. Consider using a crystal, metal, or opaque ceramic vase. If you'd like something more rustic, reuse a container once meant for something else. A few good options include large mason jars, tin cans, pitchers, plastic tumblers, and teapots.  Clean your chosen container with hot water and soap, then rinse it well to remove any residue.   Bacteria can significantly shorten the lifespan of cut tulips, so it's crucial to start with a clean container if you want your tulips to live past a few days.  Roughly three-quarters of the container should be filled with mildly cool to lukewarm water.   The stems draw lukewarm water up more readily than ice cold water, so if you want to keep the tulips healthy, room temperature water is your best option.  For the vast majority of tulip arrangements, you should trim the stems so that roughly two-thirds of the stem height remains constrained by the vase.This height makes use of the natural arc of the stem. For large arrangements, you'll want the tulips to hit about 5 inches (12.7 cm) above the rim of the container. For medium and small arrangements, you'll need to keep about 4 inches (10 cm) above the rim. As before, trim the stems under running water with a clean, sharp knife.    You can situate the stems so that they are standing straight up, or you can crisscross them in the basin of the container to create an interlocking web that will hold the stems in place. The former will keep the tulips upright while the latter will cause the tulips to tilt outward.  Use the remaining tulips to fill in the space at the center of the container. Space them apart as evenly as possible.   If the outer tulips are angled, the inner ones should be placed at a slight angle, too. Likewise, if the outer tulips are straight and upright, the inner ones should also be upright.  If you placed the stems in an upright position, grab the portion just above the mouth of the container with both hands and rotate the top of the stems slightly to one side.Doing this will cause the tulips to fan out gently without bending the stems. The effect will be less dramatic than stems placed at a crisscross, though, which means there will also be less stress on the stems themselves.  Single tulip displays can work well in a range of containers, too, but the containers either be very narrow or very short.   A single bud vase would work well as a more traditional option, or you can look for a tall, narrow cylinder vase that extends above the height of the entire tulip. Make sure that the vase is skinny enough for the tulip to fit snugly; otherwise, the flower will flop around inside. Glass bottles with narrow mouths can be a good option if you want to go the recycled, rustic route. Teacups, baby food jars, and tiny tin cans are a few other options.  Use hot, soapy water to thoroughly clean out any dirt and debris from your chosen container. Rinse it with clean, running water when done to remove any soap residue.   Bacteria in the vase or water will cause the tulips to die significantly faster than they would in a clean vase.  Fill the container with enough water to cover anywhere from one-half to three-quarters of the tulip stem.   The height of your chosen container will somewhat determine how full you can make it.  Tall, skinny containers should be filled to cover roughly three-quarters of the tulip stem. A short, wide container may not extend that far along the height of the stem, but you should try to keep at least half of the stem submerged to avoid dehydrating the tulip.   Use lukewarm water since tulips are able to draw it up more easily than ice cold water.  The exact stem height you'll need for your single tulip display will depend on the type of container used.   When using a tall, narrow container meant to enclose the entire tulip, a longer stem will look nicer than a shorter step. The idea is to keep the tulip under the rim of the container without having too much empty glass above it. For standard, narrow bud vases, keep two-thirds to three-quarters of the stem constrained by the vase. If using a wide, short container, the depth of the container should be no less than half the height of the tulip stem.  Place the tulip inside the container and adjust as needed.   Tulips will always droop a little, but this drooping should be minimal if you are using a tall, narrow container. When using a wide, short container, position the tulip so that the stem crosses diagonally from the bottom of one side to the top of the opposite side. The soft stem will droop some, but that is usually part of the appeal in this type of display.  There is some debate regarding how helpful floral preservatives are when arranging cut tulips. While some argue that tulips do not need powdered plant food, there is no evidence to suggest that this preservative will hurt the flowers, so you can add it as a precaution if desired.   Floral preservative can be purchased at nearly any floral shop. Some may even come with your tulips when you buy them. Sprinkle the preservative in the water and let it dissolve before arranging your tulips. Add more preservative each time you change the water.  This includes direct sunlight, radiators, stoves, lamps, and television sets.   Heat can cause the tulips to run through their lifespan at a more rapid pace. As a result, your arrangement will not last as long as it otherwise could.  Tulips are heavy drinkers, so you should check the water level twice a day and add fresh water at least once a day.   To improve the health of your tulips, it is wise to completely change the water every three or four days. Changing the water as soon as it starts to look cloudy minimizes the amount of bacteria in the water, thereby increasing the overall lifespan of your flowers.  Each time you change the water, you should also trim the bottom 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the stem using a sharp, clean knife.   Regularly trimming more off the bottom of the stem removes decayed stem that could otherwise block the rest of the healthy, active water uptake channels. As a result, the stems can draw water up more easily and for a longer period of time. Keep the stems submerged under water while cutting them.	Determine how many tulips to purchase. Choose an ideal color. Take tulips that are still closed. Trim the stems under running water.Use a sharp, clean knife to cut the bottom 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of each stem. Remove most of the leaves. Straighten them out. Choose a container. Clean the container. Fill with lukewarm water. Trim the tulips for height, if necessary. Line the border.Place two-thirds to three-quarters of your tulips around the perimeter of the container. Fill in the center. Give the arrangement a twist. Pick a container. Clean it thoroughly. Fill the container with water. Trim the stems down further, if necessary. Sit the tulip inside. Consider adding plant food. Place the tulips away from sources of significant heat. Refill the water. Trim every few days.
Character clowns are simply clowns that look like exaggerated versions of people, stereotypes, or emotions. For example, the classic "sad clown" look is a type of character clown. You could also be a perplexed clown, an angry clown, a doctor clown, or a sexy clown - you get the picture.  Spread a thin layer of white base makeup on your face. Use the makeup sponge to evenly distribute the white base makeup to all areas of your face, covering your eyebrows as well. Most clowns will stop the application of the base makeup at their hairline, slightly below the jaw line and right in front of the earlobes.   Even out inconsistencies in the base makeup. Take a closer look at your base makeup and retouch any areas that have more or less makeup on them by patting them with the makeup sponge. Remember to set your base makeup using theatrical face powder and a powder puff.  Based on the character you have chosen to become, apply different colors of makeup and makeup designs to areas of your face you want to highlight.   If you're going to be a sad clown, choose a color to outline a frown around your mouth and down to your chin. Sad clowns often have black paint on the bottom half of their face, around the mouth, to indicate that they are unshaven. If you want to be a perplexed clown, draw a thick, cocked eyebrow on your forehead, and a regular eyebrow on the other side. To be a sexy clown, draw exaggerated black eyelashes above and blow your eyes, and use red to make large, luscious lips.  Patting the powder puff on each different colored area will ensure the colors won't run together.  Double check your clown makeup to make sure the lines are sharp and the colors aren't bleeding into the surrounding makeup.	Choose a character. Make your face into a canvas. Create exaggerated features. Set your makeup each time you add a color. Smooth or fill in any inconsistencies.
; ,, A glissando is indicated by a squiggly line traveling downwards or upwards diagonally. See what note the fall starts on and what it ends on. How long is the starting note?  , Start out slowly and eventually speed up. If you are not as experienced, a simple scale in whatever key the piece is will work, but you should still start and end on the same notes.  Start on the first note of the glissando and play a chromatic scale down to the last note. The glissando should last as long as the first note is notated. So, if the first note is a half note, the glissando would last two beats. Then play the last note of the glissando for as long as the music indicates.  You should attack the first note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. You should arrive at and release the second note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. That means you don't have a lot of time to dwell on all the notes in between. It's more important to keep the notes at either end in time, than to clearly hit every note on the chromatic scale in between.	Warm up as you normally would. Work on your scales, especially chromatic scales.  , Examine the music. Play a chromatic scale from the first note of the glissando to the last note. Play the glissando. Keep in rhythm.
The VIN number will consist of a 17-digit alpha-numeric code engraved on a badge on the upper left side of the dash. It will be visible from either inside the car or from outside the car through the windshield. The VIN can also be found on the driver's side doorjamb sticker.   Determine the World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI). This consists of the first 3 characters of the VIN. Character 1 denotes the manufacturer. Character 2 denotes the country of manufacture. Character 3 denotes the division of the company that manufactured the car. Identify the Vehicle Descriptor Section (VDS). The VDS consists of characters 4 through 9 of the VIN. It defines the model, body type, restraint system, transmission type, and engine type of the car. Character 9 is a "check" digit generated using a formula developed by the Department of Transportation to determine invalid VIN numbers. Determine the Vehicle Identifier Section (VIS). This consists of characters 10 through 17 of the VIN. Character 10 indicates the model year. Character 11 indicates the plant of manufacture. Characters 12 through 17 give the production sequence number. This is the number assigned to the car on the assembly line.; , Access the definitions for these codes from the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Each manufacturer defines the meanings of the characters in the VIN number and submits this definition to the NHTSA for approval.  Make sure that it substantially is the vehicle type determined by the World Manufacturer Identifier and the Vehicle Descriptor Section.  Provide the VIN to 1 of several car history retrieval services available on the Internet. For a fee, which will vary from provider to provider, you can get a detailed report about the history of the vehicle.   Review VIN report details. The report may include information about multiple owners, major accidents, mileage rollback, frame damage, flood damage, branded a lemon, last reported mileage, recall information and warranty information.	Obtain the VIN number for the car. Obtain the code definitions. Inspect the car visually. Obtain the history of the vehicle.
You will need to use a special kind of yarn to make a ruffle scarf. This yarn is called sashay yarn and it looks like a long strip of mesh when you unfurl it. Choose a sashay yarn in the color of your choice.  You can use another type of yarn that is designed to create ruffles as well. For example, you could try using a ribbon yarn or a chiffon yarn., You will also need to use a crochet hook that is appropriate for your sashay yarn. Check the yarn label to see what size hook is recommended.  A size J-10 (6mm) or K-10 (6.5mm) hook should work well for this project., Sashay yarn can be a little tricky to work with because of all of the loops. Placing stitch markers to indicate where you started working and where each of your rows begins and ends can help to make working with this yarn a little easier.	Use sashay yarn. Choose an appropriate hook size. Use stitch markers.
Plain, 4-hole or 2-hole buttons would work best for this method. You can still use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, however. Whichever style of button you use, make sure that it is the same size, or a little bit bigger, than your earring posts.; , For a cute look, pass some embroidery thread through the holes. If you are using a 4-hole button, pass the thread through the holes to create an X-shape. If you are using a 2-hole button, simply pass the thread through the holes once or twice. When you are done, tie the thread off in the back of the button, and snip off any excess.   If you are using coat-style buttons, cut the loop off with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters. Use a piece of sandpaper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges., It might be a good idea to do this on a piece of wax paper in case any glue leaks out through the holes. If you added thread to the buttons, however, you won't have to worry as much about this.  The best type of glue to use for this would be super glue, industrial-strength glue, or some type of epoxy glue. Avoid putting too much on, however, or it may leak through the button holes!If you do not have pierced ears, you can use clip-on earring backings instead.  Try to make the post as centered as possible. If you are using a 4-hole button, use the holes as guides., Depending on the type of glue you are using, this may take a few minutes to a few hours. If you don't wait long enough, the earring may fall apart. Refer to the label on your bottle or tube of glue for specific drying times.  Once the glue has dried, your earrings are ready to wear. Be gentle when taking them out, however, or they may break apart.	Get a pair of matching buttons. Prep the buttons, if desired. Set the buttons face down. Place a bead of glue onto the back of an earring post. Gently place the post onto the back of the button. Wait for the glue to dry. Wear your earrings.
A lei can be made from any kind of fresh flowers — plumeria, roses, daisies and carnations are all popular choices — but you can choose any blooms, leaves or ferns from your garden.          You'll find it easier to make a lei from medium-sized flowers with sturdy stems and durable petals. Flowers with delicate petals that fall off or bruise easily are not a good choice. To make one, single-strand 40" lei you will need approximately 50 blossoms. Try to pick each flower at the base of its stem to make sure the stamen remains intact.; , Leave about 1/4 - 1/2 inch left.  Cut a piece of thread, cotton string or fishing line 100" in length. Doubled over, this allows for a 40-inch lei with 5 inches at each end for tying together when you are finished.  Take a large needle and thread the length of string through the eye, until it is doubled over. Tie the two ends of the string together to form a knot — this will act as a stopper for the threaded flowers.          Make sure to leave 4 or 5 inches of string hanging below the knot — this will be necessary to tie the lei once it's finished, In Hawaii, they use a 12'' to 18'' steel lei needle to string the flowers — so if you can get your hands on one of these, that's great. Otherwise, any large needle will do., Take your first flower and pass the needle straight through the center of the face of the flower, all the way through to the back. Gently push the flower down along the string.          Alternatively, you can pass the needle up through the stem and out through the center of the flower. Which method you choose will depend on the type of flower you're working with. Be very gentle when pushing the flower down the string — if you push too forcefully you could damage the flower or even rip it off.  Continue to string the remaining blooms in the same fashion, passing the needle through the face or stem of each flower. You can have all of the flowers facing the same direction, or alternate for added texture.          Some lei-makers prefer to slide blossoms to the end in groups of five or so, which accelerates the process but can cause wear and tear on the flowers if you're not careful. If you're working with different colored flowers, it's a good idea to separate them out into different bundles — this will allow you to work more quickly and avoid mixing up the order of the colors. Continue adding flowers until the lei is approximately 40" in length. Hold it up around your neck in front of a mirror to ensure that you're happy with the number and placement of the flowers.  When you've finished stringing all of the flowers, adjust the placement of the first and last flowers so they're nested together, and then tie the ends of the string in a square knot.          Leave the hanging ends of your knot in place until just before you present the lei – this way you can hold it by these strings and avoid touching the flowers. Cut off the excess string and, if you like, add some curling ribbon for extra adornment. Now your lei is ready to be presented to its recipient! A lei can be worn more than once. Store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator between uses to keep it fresh. Mist lightly with water to keep it hydrated.	Collect some fresh flowers. Cut off the stems of each flower. Cut your string. Thread the needle. String the first flower. String the remaining flowers. Finish the lei.
You can use a simple 1 liter plastic bottle to make a variety of greenhouses. These are ideal for growing a single, short, shallow-rooted plant. Examples would include an orchid, a small fern, or a cactus. Look for bottles in a variety of shapes, as this can give you more customization options.   To make a complex soda bottle greenhouse, begin with two bottles. One should be slightly wider than the other if possible. Carefully cut the top off of the thinner bottle, just past the point where it curves to form the tube section. Cut as straight and clean as possible. Use hot glue to attach the opening of the bottle top you just cut to the bottom of the remainder of the bottle. This will form a vase-like base for your mini greenhouse. Smooth any rough edges so that it sits evenly on a table. Next, make the lid for the greenhouse by cutting the top off of the wider bottle, maybe a centimeter below where the top curves into the tube section. The top of this bottle then becomes a lid for the thinner bottle to which you glued the base. If using this style, be sure to put the proper growing materials at the bottom of your greenhouse. This style does not have drainage and will have to be treated more like a terrarium. A simpler method would be to cut the bottom from a 1 liter bottle and simply push the upper portion into the dirt or over a small pot but this will not look as nice as the method described above.; , You can use a 1 gallon bottle in much the same way as the 1 liter bottle. It will, however, need to be reasonably tube-like in shape (if going over a pot or making a vase structure). This bottle can accommodate up to three small plants of the same varieties used with the 1 liter jars.   You can also use this bottle to create a base which drains, by puncturing the bottom and cutting 1” vertical lines into the bottom edge of the lid. Be sure to leave at least 1” of jar above the desired dirt line when cutting for the lid. This will keep the dirt from falling out when the bottle is opened.  If you want to grow very small plants, you can use a lidded mason jar to create a small terrarium. Mason jars come in a variety of sizes and should be chosen appropriate to the size of the plant you intend to grow. Simply fill it with growing materials appropriate to a terrarium and you will have a beautiful tiny greenhouse.  You can use a fish tank to make either a mini greenhouse or a terrarium. Either a square or rectangular tank can be used or you can use a fishbowl. It will depend on the size and number of the plants you intend to grow.   A small plant in a bed can simply be covered with an upside-down, wide opening fishbowl. A right-side up fishbowl can be used like a terrarium, either covered with plastic or left open at the top. A large tank can be treated as a terrarium with no drainage, holes can be drilled in the bottom to provide drainage, or (if it has a glass bottom) it can be flipped upside-down to form a greenhouse. If left right-side up, a lid will need to be created from plastic wrap or using the wood-frame method described below.	Use a 1 liter soda bottle. Use a 1 gallon soda bottle. Use a mason jar. Use a fish tank.
It is important to use materials that will ensure that your sticker can survive the outdoor environment. Acrylic varnish as a base, followed by a gloss varnish to cover the acrylic varnish is ideal. Look for acrylic varnish with UV protection. The gloss varnish forms a rubbery coating that stops the rain from causing the color to run. Workable fixative can be used as substitute for the acrylic varnish. These varnishes will not hurt the adhesive on the other side of the paper either.; , Acrylic inks come in a wide array of colors and metallic inks too. You just need brushes but the inks will go a long way. You can also get away with being less precise as they will not typically cover the black outline you laid down.  There are a lot of markers out there but many of them will not stand the test of time. A good marker has to be oil-based marker, meaning don't use a Sharpie. A few companies that make good markers are:   Marvy Uchida Deco color. These are the best for fills and and outlines because they can cover almost anything but be wary of the fumes. These will last outside without being treated for a while. Sharpie oil paint. This is good for fills and outlines and has less odor than Deco. These will last outside without being treated for a while. Sharpie poster paint. These are good for outlines and sometimes for fills. These will not last outside without being treated for a while. Elmers paint markers. These are better for outlines, especially the black. These will last outside without being treated for a while. Sakura. The metallic inks are the best. The color inks last when treated.  Use a pencil to draw out the initial design. By using a pencil first, you can correct or redraw what you do not like. You can order the paper from many sources online; cheap matte finish paper is ideal as it will be getting treated anyway. Do not use an ink jet because the ink will not survive the weather. Only laser printers and copy machines will produce a black that lasts because the ink is melted on to the paper. , There are two possible ways - print out a design using a laser printer or just draw it out. When a lot of black is involved, it's easier to use the laser printer ink from the computer. You could also draw it out and take it to the copy shop to make copies on sheets of sticker paper as well.  Touch up lines after you have finished coloring it.  It is best to use the inks for this because they end up being cheaper than the markers when covering larger areas. They also lack the fumes of the markers, so are more pleasant to work with. When treated properly, the colors will last for quite a long time outside.  After painting in the design, add any decoration with paint markers. You can also do this step after spraying with workable fixative if you want to add a layer of color.  Although this step is not completely essential, it does ensure that the inks won't bleed when the gloss varnish is applied. Use either acrylic varnish or workable fixative. Work on this outside because of the fumes. It is recommended to do this direct onto an old board or a piece of cardboard so that the spray does not end up everywhere.  Once you have applied the gloss varnish, the inks will be sealed in and weather-protected. This step is vital to outdoor endurance. There are not fumes with gloss varnish, so this step can be done indoors.  If you don't do this, your brush will turn hard and become unusable. Artist's pink soap is good to use but any type of soap will work.  Use an Exacto knife to cut out the design. It is up to you whether or not you leave a border of white space or not. Scissors could be used in place of the knife.  They are now ready to stick outdoors. Make sure that the surface on which you apply your sticker is very clean and smooth. You might need to wipe it with paper towels etc. Latex based spray adhesive (e.g., 3M Photo Adhesive (Orange Label)) is a good choice for affixing your stickers. It is inexpensive, widely available, relatively easy to remove and will not damage most non-porous surfaces.	Obtain the proper materials. Choose suitable inks. Select the markers. Take a full blank sheet of paper. Draw over the pencil lines with a permanent maker.  , Find the method that works best for you. Outline all the drawings on the page. Fill in the design. Decorate the design. Fix the inks on the paper. Seal the inks in. Wash your brush immediately after using the gloss varnish. Cut the design out. Apply your stickers.

Once you notice that your roof has been damaged, you'll need to make sure that the cause was hail. If you experience a serious storm, suspect that it hailed and potentially damaged your roof.  Inspect your roof after a storm. Look for other indicators around your property for signs of hail.If you’re renting, contact your landlord if you suspect hail damage.  You don't need to get a ladder and photograph your roof up close. Take pictures of your house and roof after a storm. Document the hail itself if it's available on the ground., Use a reputable roofing company to inspect your roof for a quote. Be careful choosing a roofing contractor. There are many unauthorized companies that can lead to fraud. Only deal with a "factory-certified" roofing contractor., Make sure you are around so you can tell them that no repairs are to be done. Reinforce that they are only there for an inspection. Request the contractor to outline with chalk any damaged areas.Listen for any noises of the roofer trying imitate hail damage onto your roof. Don’t sign anything.  Locate your homeowner's insurance policy. Organize all the facts and documents gathered about the specifics of the damage. You'll be assigned a claim number by your insurance company. Each insurance company handles the aftermath differently. Be sure your insurance will cover all damages before hiring a contractor.	Confirm the damage was hail. Document what you can. Schedule an inspection. Be home when they inspect. File your claim.
Make sure there is no power going to the sewing machine before beginning to thread it. If you leave the power in, you risk hurting yourself or damaging the machine during the threading process.; , Turn the hand wheel toward you to slowly raise the needle.  Grasp the small handle on the side of the machine to raise the presser foot so that the thread can pass through the threading points on the machine.  Some machines have a vertical spool pin, and others have a horizontal spool pin. Either way, secure the thread to the spool pin.  Lead it through the lower slot on the underside of the thread guide first, then pass it through the upper slot. Lead the thread around to the right and pull it through.  Pass the thread to the right and under the guide, so that you insert it from the bottom over the top. Carefully snap the thread into place.  Guide it into the threading channel and let it slip onto the tension discs.  Pass the thread under the hook and into the eye, where it will stay in place.  It's a small hook that holds the thread tension. Some machines have more than one guide above the needle to serve this purpose.  Lead the thread from front to back.	Turn the machine off. Raise the needle to its highest position. Lift the presser foot. Place a spool of thread on the spool pin. Pass the thread through the first thread guide. Pass the thread through the second thread guide. Pass the thread around the tension mechanism. Thread the take-up lever eye. Thread the guide just above the needle. Thread the needle.
If you need an even arc over several heat of tubing as opposed to one bend, then a tube roller is going to produce much better results. You can find a tube roller at most hardware stores, and they’re actually going to be cheaper than pneumatic bending devices.   As with tube benders, your tube roller may come with a set of dies, so you can fit the exact size of tube you need to roll without the risk of flattening it.  A tube roller works by placing increased force on a piece of tubing, then rolling it back and forth over the force to create an even bend. Begin by placing the tube into the roller with the appropriately sized die holding it in place.With a tube roller, you will start at one end rather than in the middle.  Most tube rollers will have a hex head bit, so you can use a regular wrench to increase the force in the vice., For basic tube roller models, the device will simply have a large wheel attached that your turn to feed the tube through and under the applied force.Turning the wheel will require a bit of strength, especially as you increase the force on the tube in later passes.  Once you have passed the tube from one end to the other down the roller, you should increase the force in the vice by tightening the rod by approximately another quarter of a turn., The wheel on the roller allows you to turn either direction, so with more pressure on the tube, you’ll roller it back through in the opposite direction., Continue tightening the roller by a quarter turn after each pass through the device and rolling it again. After several passes, you’ll notice the nice, even arc forming on the tube. Continue rolling until you have the angle you need.   If you have a template for the exact angle you need, you can hold it again the angle in the tube after each pass until you’ve achieved your desired result.	Purchase a tube roller. Place the tubing into the roller. Crank the vice on the roller until it’s tight. Manually roll the piece through the roller. Increase the force on the tube. Roll the tube back in the opposite direction. Repeat until you reach the desired angle.
This is an important requirement as it ensures that you will be able to get the maximum visibility when moving over the application of the motif.; , If it doesn't matter that it shows, or if it forms part of the design to have the thread showing, be sure to select thread that matches the motif. If you want the stitches to be invisible, however, use clear monofilament thread on top and a thread that matches the background fabric in the bobbin:   For lighter shades (whites, creams, beige, etc.), use clear monofilament thread. For darker shades (blues, greens, blacks, etc.), use smoke-coloured monofilament thread.  The stitching is dependent on your design and wishes. Here are some hints:   Naive style: use zigzag stitch set narrow and open Neat satin stitch: use zigzag stitch set close Blind hem stitch: use this set with a very reduced length and width. If you want to use this stitch but your machine doesn't have it, resort to using the narrow open zigzag stitch style instead.  The same goes for when you complete the stitching, to finish off.  If you haven't done this before, try a test piece first, using a scrap rather than a motif. Do this until you feel comfortable with the method of application. Once you feel ready, go for it!	Use an open-toe appliqué foot. Consider whether you want the thread to show or not on the motif itself. Select and set the appropriate stitching type on your machine. Start by back-stitching initial threads to keep them secured to the fabric. Stitch on the motif.
With so many cars with anti-lock brakes (ABS), people just slam on the brakes in any situation. This can be a good option, but it is not always the best. Braking (even with ABS) can cause reduced handling capabilities and actually place you in more danger. Turning while on the brakes can cause the vehicle to neither turn as well as it could without the brakes or cause the vehicle to slowdown less than it could have without turning (read some of the maneuvers for further explanation).  In 90% of corners, racers (of any race type) use their brakes before they get to the corner, make the corner, then use the gas. Each section of the corner (or the straights before and after the corner) has its own purpose and separation of brakes and turning gives the best traction for the vehicle to make a desired corner.  There is also a technique called "Trail Braking," which is essentially braking while cornering. It is best executed by entering a corner quickly, and braking hard before turning. Continue braking until you have slowed down enough. Trail Braking transfers weight from rear to front, thus pushing the front tires into the ground and giving the car more steering bite. This should only be done with experience, because it can easily backfire.  Depress your brake pedal, do not slam it to the ground. This is a method called squeezing your brakes, and is essential to get the best braking potential from your vehicle. You bring your vehicle's tires just to the point of breaking traction. While some people say pumping your brakes is a good way to stop, especially on low traction surfaces, it is only a reliable way to stop in an emergency.   This can be easily practiced in an empty parking lot. Roll down your windows and start at one end of the lot. Accelerate to a safe speed (30–40 mph (48–64 km/h) should be good) and slam your brakes as hard and you can. You should hear a good deal of squealing (if you do not, you may have ABS, you may not have disc brakes, or your brakes may need replacing). Now go back the other direction and this time quickly depresses your brakes until you get the squealing again. Go back and forth until you are able to apply your brakes while only hearing a whisper of squealing (this is called the optimal squeeze point – OSP). What is the whisper of squealing I speak of? This is the point where your tire's rubber is being twisted and contorted to a point that only parts of your tires are actually skidding; this is the absolute limit of your tire's traction, and the quickest way to stop. You can measure this by setting up markers as to when to start braking and when you stop the car, and you can visually see the difference between your tires locked up and not. Extra practice: Purposely lock up your brakes. Now practice reducing pressure on the pedal until it stops locking up, then apply pressure to the OSP again). Take note: each surface and speed will have different OSP's. This is why you should practice while it is dry, then while it is raining, and then when it is snowy (if available). Get yourself adequately adapted to different traction levels so nothing will surprise you.  In almost all cases, just depressing your brake pedal smoothly (albeit quickly) to the floor is often best. You will likely feel the pedal either vibrate (dependent ABS) or feel like it gives out altogether (independent ABS). Either way it is a sign of the ABS working. Of course, if the pedal feels like it gave out, and you aren't stopping, your brakes probably gave out, in which case you should just kiss it goodbye (or read the wikiHow article, How to Stop a Car with No Brakes).	Braking is a lost skill. Race car drivers, who are always on the edge with their vehicles, have learned the needed skill of separating braking from turning. Using your brakes (if you do not have ABS) should be done smoothly. Using your brakes (if you have ABS) is much simpler. For more information on braking, read How to Brake and Stop a Car in the Shortest Distance.
A composition's tonality states the key and whether it is Major or Minor.At an early stage of composition, a key could be as simple as making an arbitrary choice, but it will have the biggest impact on the sound of your composition. If you finish your work later on and want to try it out in different keys, you should do so, but be forewarned that it takes a fair amount of work to transpose a composition note by note into another key.  Every possible combination has been tried and studied at this point. With that, theory can suggest the most appropriate chords. The most famous of these is the I-IV-V-vi progression (the lower case denotes a Minor chord). The Roman numerals indicate how many keys above the root the given chord is. These four chords have been proven to go together very well.   Try using a chord map to get you started.Although this might sound too mathematical at the start, the truth is that it'll come without thinking to you once you get the basics of theory down pat.  Although melodies need to be properly felt out in order to be memorable and effective, using a scale will narrow down the notes you're conventionally supposed to use.   Make sure the scale you're using is in accordance with the chords and key you've chosen. The standard scale is a C Major scale. This scale is often used for vocal warm-ups before a performance.  Changing all of the keys even a 16th of a step can result in a strange new experience of the piano. Be advised that messing around with a piano should only be done if you are an expert. Otherwise, you'll probably just end up sabotaging your piano for regular use.  Notation is the technical language of music. If you're a serious composer, it's essential that you have at least some knowledge of notation and how to get your ideas down accurately on paper. Although it takes a little bit of time to get used to, there are fortunately lots of free online resources to help get you up to par with your notation reading and writing. If you're completely new to notation, you should try sight-reading a few basic songs on the piano until you're more used to it.   There are digital notation programs that may prove easier to work with than pen and paper.	Decide upon a tonality. Explore chord progressions leading from the root chord.The piano keyboard has been explored to death. Develop melodies from a chosen scale.Scales are useful tools in the creation of melody. Experiment with tuning.Some avant-garde composers in the 20th century would open up the piano itself and change the tuning of the strings, but prior to the adoption of equal temperament for keyboard instruments in the 18th century, there were numerous tunings in use. Record your work via notation.
Whether it's a used one online or a new frame from a bike shop you can swap out your frame for something a little more conducive to the speeds of the road like a carbon or aluminum frame that brings durability and lightweight.   You’ll want something light but the size of the frame is most often based on your height and weight. The weight to shoot for the entire bike itself is under 20 lbs and the frames can help make up a lot of weight. You’ll want to consult someone from your local bike shop if you have any concern about your weight and the durability of a frame.  Your bikes tires and frame are connected using a fork. Buy one made of carbon to give you that lightweight a road bike needs.  Road tires are pretty narrow and are not built to withstand the bumps and rough terrain of mountain bikes. You’ll want a road touring or racing tire. There should be a number on the tires to indicate the size. You’ll want something that is a 700 width and should read something like 700x23. The first number is outer diameter of the tire in millimeters and the second number is the actual width of tire itself in millimeters. Most road bikes use inflatable tubes and the tube can be replaced if your bike requires it in the future.	Pick the frame. Buy a lightweight fork. Pick road bike tires.
Describe it in as much detail as possible. Avoid being too brief with the description. For example, saying "large pure black tom with amber eyes" is too simplistic. Instead, describe your warrior cat as: "Pure black tom with dark amber eyes, the exact shade of fire. His glossy fur is long, and he sheds frequently. His tail is shorter than average and seems twice as thick due to his long, flowing fur. He is stocky and thick compared to his height, though he is taller than the average tom."   Choose only natural fur and eye colors, no purple, pink, green, yellow, or straight orange, red and blues on cats. If you want to have a 'blue' cat, make sure they are a dark silver or pale gray, maybe even a blue-gray like Bluestar, and red cats should be either orange, ginger, red-brown, or even a mixture of browns and ginger. Orange fur is usually a lighter ginger colors. The cat's eyes should either be blue, gray, yellow, amber, green, you could also look up natural eye colors for cats to see what possibilities there are.; , When describing your cat you need to include the name (see next step), fur color, gender, eye color, clan, personality, and any kits or mates. For example:   Rosestar: Cream colored she-cat with blue-green eyes. Very stubborn but loyal. No kits or mate. Silverthorn: Silver gray she-cat with amber eyes. Mysterious and loyal. Has a kit called Yewkit. Nobody knows her mate. Lightningtail: golden-yellow tom with a white stripe across its body, a zig-zagged tail, and gold eyes. Brave and very kind. Mate is Icepool. No kits. Owlpaw: brown and white tom with green eyes. Clever and brave. No kits or mate.  Think through the cat's likely life story when coming up with a name. Imagine your (male) cat as a kit, his eyes still closed. You are his mother and you must name him. For example, "Nightkit. He is large and dark, like the night sky, and the moon is occasionally orange, and its eyes would look like moons in the night sky." Then, zoom to his warrior ceremony. He is a young cat, Nightpaw. Take into consideration his pelt color, length, his eye color, his personality, size, and everything about him. Nightnose wouldn't make sense because there is nothing special about his nose or sense of smell. But Nighttail, Nightfur, Nightheart, and Nightshadow are good ideas. Nighttail because of his bushy tail. Nightfur because of his fuzzy pelt. Nightshadow because he is very dark black. And Nightheart because he is brave and tough, but kind-hearted.   Warrior cat names must be based on nature and must be things that cats know about or come into contact with. Thus, names like 'Dragonfang' and 'Princesspaw' or 'Marshmallow Nose' are not allowed because these aren't things cats are familiar with. Common pet names are not allowed unless the cat is a former kittypet. Warrior cat names come in two parts. The first part stays constant throughout life, and the second part changes based on rank. Cats younger than six moons (months) have the suffix 'kit'. Cats older than that are apprentices and have 'paw'. After they become warriors, they get a warrior name. If they happen to become leader after that, the suffix changes to 'star'. For example: Amberkit, Amberpaw, Amber gaze, Amberstar.  It doesn't have to be too detailed if you draw it. Just get your point across!	Develop the cat's appearance. Break down the description components. Make up a name for your cat based on what you know about the cat. Find or draw a picture of your cat.
Many people choose to listen to music or talk radio while driving, but in order to ensure you minimize distractions, don’t try to change the station or show until you are stationary.Making changes to what you are listening to can distract you from what’s going on in front of you. Changing the station or show while stopped will permit you to focus your attention on the road, instead of the radio.  If you need to use your phone while driving, always utilize a hands-free device that allows you to communicate without having to control your phone with your hands, which can draw your attention from the road.Remember to keep your focus on driving when using hands-free devices. Never look at your phone to connect a hands free device while you’re driving.  In order to ensure you are not visibly distracted, keep your cell phones, lap tops and tablets safely stored within the vehicle as you drive. The best way to ensure you cannot be distracted by your cell phone while you’re driving, however, is simply to turn it off. While your phone is off, phone calls will be sent to voicemail and text messages will be saved until you can access them.   It is illegal to use your phone for text messaging or other similar tasks while driving in most places. If the phone call is important, they should leave a message you can return upon pulling over.	Choose your music or radio station while stopped. Use caution when using voice activated systems. Turn off or stow your cell phone.
Start by running the dryer for 10 minutes. This will soften the lipstick and make it easier to remove. You can alternatively use a hairdryer to heat up the specific spot which is being affected. This may be easier and more efficient to do.  With the drum hot, wipe the lipstick with a soft, dry cloth. Switch which part of the cloth you wipe with frequently, to keep from spreading the lipstick any more.   You can also try using a makeup wipe to remove the lipstick.  Unplug the dryer and then soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Use this to wipe off the remaining lipstick. When you've removed as much of it as you can, rinse with a wet rag or paper towels.  With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any product which might still remain.	Warm the dryer. Wipe off as much as you can. Clean out the remaining product with rubbing alcohol. Run a cycle with old towels.
; , Crepe myrtle needs full sun to thrive, so the location you choose should receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day on average.  These trees grow best in loose, well-drained soil. Clear a spot that is about 3 feet by 3 feet (1 yard by 1 yard). Loosen the soil in that spot by chopping it up with a rake or shovel.  If you have heavy soil, you may need to mix a little peat moss or garden sand into the soil to improve its drainage properties. You can also mix in compost or a slow-release fertilizer, but if you do, you should make sure to mix the additive thoroughly to the entire plant bed. Uneven pockets of nutrients in the soil can cause the roots to develop poorly.  Crepe myrtle thrive in soil that is neutral to slightly acidic, about 6.0 to 7.3. If you need to decrease the pH, mix in additional organic matter like compost or manure. If you need to increase the pH, mix in agricultural lime.  The hole should be twice as wide as the root ball, but it should be about the same depth as the nursery pot holding the plant. Avoid planting the root ball any deeper than that since the soil around the root ball needs to stay oxygenated. For best results, the root ball should be about level with the soil.  Lightly pack the soil around the base of the tree. The soil should be heavy and packed enough to help hold the young tree in place, but it should still be fairly loose to allow the roots room to grow.	Plant the crepe myrtle during a dormant season.Early spring is generally considered best, but you can also plant the tree during fall or winter, as long as you live in a region where the winters are mild and the ground does not freeze. Choose a sunny location. Till the soil. Amend the soil. Test the pH of the soil. Dig a large hole and place the root ball inside. Fill the hole in with soil.
Similar to making a single-strand piece of kandi, wrap your string around your wrist to get an estimated length. Then, unravel your string so that you have a significant amount more, about three feet in excess (3 feet makes about 8 rows).  Choose a pattern of beads that you want; this could be very simple and geometric or a complete image. Many websites offer patterns you can use to produce an image on your cuff. Place enough beads on the string to completely encircle your wrist.  You'll end up with one short end and one very long end of elastic. You will continue adding rows of beads onto the long end.  To do this, continue past the stopping point of the first row in a circular pattern one row above. In the second row, string your thread every-other bead through a bead below it in the first row. This means your beads will be staggered between rows, not lined up vertically.  Follow the same step as in #3, where you thread your string through a bead in the row below it every-other bead. Continue this for as many rows as you like, or until you run out of string. By this time, if you used elastic thread, your rows should start to stand up creating the more obvious cuff shape.          Tip: Always thread through the next high row bead.  Do this at the end of a complete row so that your cuff is even. Thread your string through the last bead in the row beneath it and tie it off.  Your cuff is now completed, and is ready to be worn or gifted as a token of friendship.	Measure your string. Begin beading your cuff. Tie the circle shut with a knot. Make a second row of beads. Continue making new rows. Finish your cuff. Show off your work!
Another way to look at it is, the bottom of the steering wheel directs the trailer. Facing backwards tends to help the backwards feel of steering the trailer. If you need to turn the trailer around a corner, steer the trailer toward the corner. Then you must steer slightly in the opposite direction to maintain the turning angle.  to the left in a left-hand drive car) not the passenger side, which is harder to see. The most common backup is a right angle.  This is assuming that you are attempting a left-hand drive. Now turn the vehicle sharply left, so that you are positioned at an angle. You should be at less that 180 degrees on the left hand side as if you have been driving forwards around a left hand bend.  As you reverse adjust the steering wheel to keep the trailer traveling in the right direction. Remember to go slow. Don't be afraid to step out of the vehicle and check out the progress you've made. There's not use trying to do it in one try to keep your pride if you end up wrecking your trailer. It is important not to get the truck and trailer jackknifed, so do not let the turn go too far. Ideally, you can back into the space in one smooth motion. You almost always will have to stop, pull forward to achieve a more straight reverse.  Sometimes the hardest part of the process is having many people watch you. Try not to stress out if there are a lot of people checking out your progress. They aren’t invested in the outcome, and you are. Keep your focus.	Turn the wheel to the right to make the trailer go left (as you are looking toward the front of the vehicle). Back the trailer to the driver's side (e.g. Pull past as you approach the space and turn right to the middle of the road. Place your hands at the bottom of the wheel. Back up and pull forward as often as necessary until your trailer is in place.
After the stone has been cut to size you must rub two sides of the stone together to create two sides that are perfectly flat and fit flush together.; , After the stone is ready for use, a design is sketched directly onto it.  The design is carved into the stone with hand chisel tools, wood files, sewing needles, paperclips and other tools. A dremel can be used for removing larger amounts of material. The carving must be done with perfection. Once a part of the stone is removed, it cannot be added back. The areas of negative space become the positive space where the silver fills in and forms the piece. Any mistake can render the stone as useless. You must add a sprue hole at the top of the rocks to allow the silver to be poured into the mold. It is also important that you carve air vents that go from the design all the way off the edge of the tufa stone. This will allow for air to escape as the silver is poured in.  It is essential to have the tufa stone carbonized before pouring the silver. This can be done with using just the gas of a torch without the oxygen. With the two parts of the stone covered in soot and bound with a piece of rubber or clamps add the correct amount of silver into a crucible and melt it with a torch to a molten state. Pouring only takes a moment, and if done correctly should fill the entire mold.  The silver piece is removed from the mold and the extra silver in the sprue hole, not a part of the design, is cut from the piece. Sanding cleans and smooths the design, but the texture that is distinctive to tufa cast work is left where desired. This is the beauty of this form of casting. There may be smoothed sections that are created to provide contrast with the texture left by the tufa stone. Links that have been soldered together should also be individually sanded to make for a seamless link of silver. The piece can also be cleaned in a citric acid pickling solution to remove any fire scale caused when casting or soldering.  Polishing can be done with water and a rubber wheel or it can be done using polishing compounds. There is pre polishing compounds. Cut and finish compounds and final stage compounds. They can range from abrasive to non abrasive.  The final stages of creating a one of a kind piece may include various methods in order to set stones, create unique forms through the melding of multiple tufa cast silver pieces, adding links to connect pieces, or implementing whatever other inspiration comes to mind. Sanding and polishing a piece can be very time consuming. Depending on the piece of jewelry it can be up to forty or fifty percent of the work.	Stone Preparation - To begin making a piece of tufa cast jewelry you start by cutting a piece of tufa stone to the desired size that works best for your design. Create of a Design. Carve the Tufa Stone. Carbonize the Tufa Stone and Melt the Silver. Sand and Clean the Cast Silver. Polish. Complete the Work.
To measure the height of the existing window, go from the top of the sill to the bottom of the head jamb.   For a truly accurate reading, measure the window at three locations — the left, middle, and right of the window — and then take the smallest measurement (the measurements may not be different).Use this as your reading.; , To measure the width of the existing window, go from the jamb on left side of the window to the jamb on the right side of the window. Again, measure across at the top, middle, and bottom, selecting the shortest distance as your true measurement.  Take a measuring tape and measure from the top left of the frame to the bottom right of the frame, and the from the top right of the frame to the bottom left of the frame.If there's a difference of less than 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) in the diagonal lengths of your frame, you can make small adjustments with shims when you install the new windows. If the difference between the two numbers is larger than 1/4 inch, you should consider replacing the entire window frame.  This is why you measure the existing window before you remove it.  If you can, remove them without damaging them, as you'll reattach them once you've installed the new window.   If you happen to damage the inside stop pieces while removing them from the window, take a bit of wood filler and mold it onto the damaged part of the stop. Once it's dried, sand it and the surrounding wood down. Consider giving the stop a new coat of paint before reattaching to the frame.  Once the inside stops are gone, this should be a fairly easy procedure. If, however, the inside sash is connected to a weight by a chain, simply cut the connecting chain or chord and let the weight fall down to its well.  Remove the parting bead and throw it away. Then, remove the outside sash in the same way that you removed the inside sash, slashing any chains or chords that connect it to a weight.   Do not remove the exterior stops from the window frame. These stops will help guide the window in installation and nest it afterwards.  To get the window frame prepped for its new upgrade, do the following before proceeding to installation:   Remove any weights from their wells. Hoist the pulleys to the frame or remove the pulleys entirely. Drive in any protruding screws or nails out. You may want to cover them with wood filler and a putty knife, wait the filler patch to dry, and then sand and paint over it to make it inconspicuous. Remove all the old caulking with a putty or utility knife, if necessary. Make sure the opening is free of all caulking and other things that will get in the way of the new window.  It's probably best to try not to attempt this task without professional help. , Locate the bumper stops and begin to slide them over into the middle of the frame. Do this until four mounting holes in the side jambs become visible.  Some people prefer not to work with the expander, also called a header, because it decreases the available space in the window and makes replacing the trim harder. Use at your discretion.  Check to see if the window is plumb and level (using a level, of course).  There should be four mounting screws, one for the bottom and top of each side jamb. Install them gently, taking care not to deform the paneling on the side jamb. , If you do notice gaps or faulty motion on the windows, check for any adjustment screws built into the side-jambs, using them to correct the window frame.  Your project is officially done.	Measure the height of existing window. Measure the width of existing window. Finally, check the squareness by measuring diagonally across the window at both sides. Know that if you buy a window that fits the existing window frame, you won't have to buy a whole new window frame. Remove the inside stop pieces from the right and left sides of the window. Take out the inside sash from the window frame. Slide the outside sash down to the bottom portion of the frame. Clean up the remaining window frame. Double-check for rotting wood in the window frame.If you notice serious rot or water damage, consider calling a professional for a quote on replacing the window frame and any surrounding structure. Run a bead of caulk along the inner part of the outside stops on the jambs.  , Center both the inside and the outside sash vertically inside the window frame. Place an expander on top of the window, caulking it (optional). Place the window in the frame, shimming as necessary. Put in the mounting screws in each jamb. Expand the header so that is creates a seal between the top of the window and the old frame.  , Check to see that the windows work properly and don't contain any gaps. Caulk the inside of the window and reattach the inside stops.
Lavender seeds can take a while to germinate and should be started early indoors so that they have plenty of time to grow into mature plants during the warm growing season.; , In this process, seeds should be placed in a sealable plastic bag filled with moist soil. Use a commercial soil specially formulated for starting seeds. Place the plastic bag with the soil and seeds inside the refrigerator and allow it to sit for three weeks.  The seed starting mix should be a light potting mix that drains well. You can either use a plastic seedling tray or a wide, shallow container without divisions.  Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil.   If using a plastic seedling tray, plant one seed per slot. If planting in a division-free container, space the seeds 1/2 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) apart.  A light coating of potting mix protects the seeds, but the seeds also need access to sunlight in order to germinate.  A heat tray often works best, but another work location may also work as long as the temperature remains around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius)., Keep the growing medium moist, but not damp, and water the seeds in the morning so that the soil can dry some before evening hits. Soil that is too damp and cool will invite fungus to grow, and fungus will destroy your seeds.  Lavender seeds can take two weeks to one month to sprout.  After the seeds sprout, you should move the container to a location that receives plenty of direct sunlight. If no such location is available, place a fluorescent grow light about the sprouts and allow them to sit in the artificial light for eight hours a day.	Start the seeds 6 to 12 weeks before warm weather hits. Put the seeds through a process called "cold stratifying.", Fill a container with seed starting mix. Plant the seeds. Cover the seeds with 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) potting mix. Keep the seeds in a warm spot. Lightly water the seeds. Wait. Give sprouted seeds plenty of light.
Just as you'd never want to write a novel without reading one, you need to immerse yourself in the sounds of hip-hop if you want to learn to MC properly. As the MC, you'll be the master of ceremonies, the mic-controller, so you'll need to be the most skilled rapper on the stage. Listen to Dirty South rap, listen to New York boom-bap, listen to old-school rap, listen to West Coast gangsta rap, listen to rap you don't even like, and listen to the classics. Get studying, because it's the best homework you'll ever get.   If you have an interest in story-telling, check out Raekwon, DMX, Nas, and Slick Rick for their ability to spin a compelling yarn out of rhymes. If you like crazy imagery and stream-of-consciousness word play, listen to Ghostface Killah, Aesop Rock, and Lil Wayne for their ability to catch you off guard with strange rhymes and surprises. If you like hip-hop with great hooks and catchy choruses and unforgettable flow, listen to Rakim, Freddie Gibbs, and Eminem.; , No one wants to hear recycled rhymes or weak stuff bitten from other rappers, no matter how cool you look or how much swag you've got. The place to start if you want to be a proper MC is working on writing the most creative, unexpected, and catchy rhymes that you possibly can.   Get a rhyming dictionary and revise the rhymes you do write to make them more surprising and exciting. Avoid using clichéd or obvious rhymes to pad out your verses. Try to write ten new rhymes a day, even if you're not actively working on writing a song. The lines might develop into their own song, or you'll have something to start with when you get a beat you really like and want to jump on.  Even if you're writing straight-up publishable poetry, if you can't rhyme it to a beat, it won't play. Rappers who can stick to the flow are more likely to succeed than great writers of rhymes.   Get on YouTube and check out other rappers freestyles over beats that you like. On any given hit rap song, there'll be dozens of other rappers doing a freestyle over the beat. It's a good way to study up on the differences in style.  Spend lots of time with the beats you Try to rap to, letting them seep into your mind before you Try to force awkward rhymes into them. Play with different rhyme schemes and flows in each beat. There's any number of different ways to jump on a beat and you might not jive with every beat you listen to.   Seek out producers who make beats you like and use their rhythms whenever you can. Who knows, it might blossom into a good working relationship.  The best MCs are adept freestylers, who have the ability to make up unforgettable rhymes straight off the dome. But freestyling isn't a skill that comes from nowhere, you're not born with it. You can learn to develop a cache of rhyme words from which you can deviate, learning to fit in spur-of-the-moment variations on the set patterns that you've developed.   Have a store of one-liners that you work toward. If you've got a good end-line, you can come up with good lines to lead up to it, rather than using your good line as a jumping off point. Just spit. Stop thinking about what you're doing and start rhyming when you're by yourself. If there's no one around to hear, don't worry about how stupid you sound, or that it doesn't make sense. If you freestyle for five straight minutes without losing the beat, chances are you'll stumble onto at least a couple of great lines you can use later.  If you're a teenager from the suburbs, it's probably not the best idea to rap about the global cocaine trafficking empire you run. That's not to say you can't stretch the truth some, but it's important to seem real on some level. People have to believe that you're saying things that come from the heart, things that you can stand behind.   Even rappers like Riff-Raff and Die Antwoord, who are often questioned for being some kind of "joke," are serious hustlers who take their craft and their music seriously, using social media and preconceptions about what hip-hop looks like to their advantage. And they can spit. Music should come first of course, but realness should influence your look to. Cultivate a fresh look that people will gravitate toward, one that represents your music visually. Look cool.  If you don't have anything to say or add to hip-hop, it'll be hard to get anyone to listen to your songs. You don't have to be Shakespeare, but you do have to be able to craft a catchy hip-hop song that will stick in someone's mind, combining words and sounds that people will want to listen to.   Listen to lots of rap and find the gaps. Talk about the angles in popular topics other rappers don't talk about. Go where other rappers are afraid to go. Explore uncharted territory. Rap about where you come from and reference local things. Even though he's mostly rapping about traditional gangsta rap tropes, Freddie Gibbs is unique because he's a technically flawless rapper who raps about Gary, IN, an unexpected and unique place to set a rap song. It makes him and his music unique.  As the MC, you'll be the master of ceremonies, the controllers of the mic, and probably the most skilled rapper of the bunch, but to make yourself really stand out, you'll need some help. Aside from your own skills, you'll also need:    A DJ who knows how to scratch, mix, and perform. To back you instrumentally, find someone who digs your music and is skilled on the wheels of steel, someone who knows how to hold it down while you perform. It's also a good idea to find someone who's already got all the gear necessary for performing DJ sets live. Go hear some local guys spin on DJ nights and see who catches you ear.  A hype-man. Typically, a hype-man is someone who backs you up on the end-rhymes of your songs, adding another layer of texture and volume to your songs. Check out live videos of the Beastie Boys to see how the others come in on the rhyming words to emphasize the song, or how Flavor Flav rocks the stage in early Public Enemy tracks. They're not the main rappers, but a good hype man has stage presence and charisma that makes for a great performance.  Complementary MC's. The Wu-Tang Clan was built around the idea that one talented MC was great, but eight would be even greater, especially if unique and unpredictable styles and flows were all included on the same track. Find other rappers who have slightly different styles or personalities to collaborate with in your performances, giving you each an extra element to play off of.  As the MC, you're the main attraction. You have to own the stage and get people excited about the show. The DJ's got to keep the beat moving and the hype-man is there to back you up, so the pressure's on.   Banter with the audience to get them invested. Cue the DJ to drop the beat and let people sing along once you've coached them on the chorus. If you want people to be into the music, you've got to be into it to. Move around, feel the beat, and look like you're excited to be on stage. If you stand stock-still at the mic stand and look like you're bored, people will look the same way in the crowd.  If you're well prepared, you should feel confident in your abilities and in your music, so you can throw yourself into putting on the best possible show you can for the people. It's time to shine. Give them a performance they'll never forget.Make sure you've got all your lyrics memorized and have practiced using the mic so you can be confident that all the technical aspects of the performance are going to go off without a hitch. It's hard to perform with confidence if you're trying to remember all the words. It's always important to do a mic check before performing. Part of the work of performance is being there before the show to make sure everything is set up and working as planned. Don't be a fake rock star and blow off the pre-show responsibilities. Be a professional. Always go on stage sober and well-rested. Save the partying for after the show.  It'll be hard to get into your music if you're mush mouthed, too quiet, or muddy in the mix. Rap shouldn't sound like one of the adults from old Peanuts cartoons. Put your vocals up front and make sure it's loud enough to be heard from all corners of the room.   If you have trouble keeping your voice up while you perform, practice reading magazines and books out loud to get your voice naturally into a louder register. It might annoy your roommates, but it'll be worth it to amp up your performance to where it needs to be.  Both at your shows and online, be active about interacting with your growing fanbase. The MC will be the face of the crew, so you need to take the publicity side of the rap game seriously. Stay out after your gigs to meet people and sell any merch that you have, being friendly and available.   Encourage people to come out to the gigs on social media and respond to people personally on Twitter and Facebook. Rappers, maybe more so than any other group of musicians, are known for taking control of their social media and working it to its fullest potential. You're just as likely to get signed to a record deal from a popular YouTube video as a successful mixtape.	Listen to as much hip-hop as you possibly can. Write lots of rhymes. Practice your flow. Listen to lots of beats. Freestyle. Get real. Be unique. Build up a crew with a distinctive style. Get people pumped up and moving. Be confident on stage. Be clear, articulate, and loud. Keep in contact with your fans.
Threshold braking is best used with vehicles that don’t have ABS. This system prevents the wheels from locking in an emergency braking situation; so cars without it are more likely to see the wheels lock. In an icy situation, this can be incredibly dangerous and send the car into a slide.  Threshold braking allows you to brake as much as possible without hitting a point that will cause the wheels to lock. Threshold braking is also known as squeeze braking. Checking the car’s owner’s manual is the best way to know if your car has an ABS. If you’re still unsure, you can ask your mechanic., Understandably, this is difficult to do in an emergency situation, but panicking is a sure fire way to lose control of your vehicle. It’s important to keep your cool if you need to brake on ice.  If you’re worried about how you’ll react in an emergency situation, you can try your hand at driving on ice at certain driving schools., Keeping your heel to the floor lets you use the muscles in your foot to push the brakes rather than the muscles in your leg. This gives you more control.  Avoid slamming the brakes. This will cause the wheels to lock and your car will lose all traction., This is the key to threshold braking. Apply firm, steady pressure to the brake pedal. Your car should slowly start decelerating as you push the brakes. Keep the pressure even, and stop just short of causing your wheels to lock.  You’ll feel feedback in the brake pedal, a certain threshold as you brake. This is when you can get the most deceleration out of your brakes; if you go past this your wheels will lock and you’ll lose traction.	Check if your car has an anti-lock braking system (ABS). Stay calm. Keep your heel on the floor as you push the brake pedal. Push steadily with your foot.
For example, a person who is chattering on about themselves selfishly or bragging is normally recognized as arrogant or self-centered. This behavior in a person with bipolar disorder is a sign of mania, as are other risky behaviors that may be equally unappealing to you. Recognizing that this is a symptom of the illness, and not an intentional behavior by your family member is helpful in understanding their condition. However, be cautious not to associate every mood your family member has with their illness; people with bipolar disorder can be mad or sad in healthy ways, too.   One way you can understand your family member's illness better and show support is to simply ask about their experience of it. Make sure, however, that you use discretion and identify if they feel comfortable talking with you about it before you attempt to engage them. If this is too threatening, you could simply ask how they are doing and gain more information about what they are currently going through.; , Since bipolar disorder is best treated with medication and therapy, it is crucial to be supportive of your family member engaging in treatment. One way to become involved is to participate in your loved one’s psychotherapy. Family therapy can be a helpful resource in supporting an individual with bipolar disorder.   Communicate with your family member’s mental health care provider. If your loved one has signed a release for you to speak with their therapist or doctor, you can notify that person about possible concerns or problems as they arise. You can also gain more information on how to assist your family member. If your family member is not currently receiving mental health treatment, you can encourage or help them to seek treatment. PsychologyToday.com.and the American Psychological Association (APA)are both helpful resources. You can search for therapists or psychiatrists in your area who specialize in bipolar disorder. However, be careful not to push treatment on your family member if they are reluctant (unless they are potentially harmful to herself or others); this can scare them off and disrupt your relationship.  It is common for individuals with bipolar disorder to avoid taking their medication since the “high” of mania can feel good to them. If you notice that your family member has gone off their medication, the first step would be to notify their psychiatrist or general practitioner as soon as possible. Most likely the doctor will want to speak with your loved one and will inform you of how to proceed. If you are not able to speak with a doctor, you can encourage your loved one to take their medications, or provide incentives (such as special treats or doing something with them that they enjoy) if they agree to be med-complaint.  If you notice signs that your family member may be experiencing an episode, it is crucial to engage them in harm reduction.   Negotiate to reduce harm during risky behaviors (gambling, excessive spending, drug abuse, reckless driving) Keep children, disabled people, and other vulnerable people away so that the antics do not disturb them Speaking with your loved one's medical health clinician, or calling an ambulance or suicide hotline if they are at risk of harming themselves or others  , It is important to have an action plan for dealing with an emergency to effectively de-escalate a crisis. Have contact info of important relatives who can help, as well as doctor’s numbers and hospital addresses. Do not just store this information in your phone in case it loses battery; you should have these numbers written down and on you at all times (such as in a wallet or purse). Give a copy to your family member. You could even develop this plan together when your family member is emotionally stable.  A trigger is a behavior or situation that may increase the likelihood of a negative outcome, in this case, a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. Possible triggers include substances such as caffeine, alcohol, and other drugs.Triggers can also include negative emotions such as stress, an imbalanced diet, sleep irregularities (sleeping too much or too little), and interpersonal conflicts. Your loved one will have their own specific triggers. You can help by discouraging your family member from engaging in these behaviors, or by helping them prioritize their responsibilities to reduce stress levels.   Criticism and critical people are common bipolar triggers. If you live with your family member you could remove substances such as alcohol from the home. You could also attempt to foster a relaxing environment by controlling lighting, music, and energy levels.  The more educated you become about bipolar disorder, the more understanding and accepting you can be. While it may still be a challenge to cope with this disorder in the family, your concern and thoughtfulness can go a long way in supporting your family member.   One way to show that you care is by simply letting your family member know that you are there for them, and you want to be supportive of their recovery. You can also offer to listen to them if they want to talk about their illness.  Putting yourself in your family member’s shoes is a helpful way to increase your understanding of their behavior as well as to reduce your negative emotions about or reactions to their mental health. Allow yourself to imagine what it would be like to wake up unaware if that day you would be plummeted into depression or elevated into a frenzied state of energy.  Caring for a loved one with bipolar disorder can sometimes lead to stress and depressive symptoms.Remember that you can only begin to help someone else if you first maintain your own physical and mental health. Be aware of your own behaviors and your underlying feelings about your family member.   Give up control. It is important to understand and remind yourself (either aloud or in your mind) that you cannot control your family member's behaviors. They have a condition that you cannot fix. Shift your attention to focusing on your own needs. For example, you could make a list of your own personal goals and begin working toward them. Use coping resources. Coping resources are specific ways to cope with a particular issue, and they are vital to self-care. Coping strategies can include activities you enjoy such as reading, writing, art, music, outdoor activities, exercise or sports. Therapeutic activities can also assist self-care including relaxation techniques (such as progressive muscle relaxation), meditation, keeping a journal, mindfulness, and art therapy. Another way to cope is to create distance or remove yourself from stressful situations when they arise.  If you find that you are having a difficult time coping with your family member’s symptoms of bipolar disorder, it may be beneficial to receive your own therapy. Evidence suggests that gaining family therapy, not just education, can help individuals (especially caregivers/parents) deal with having a family member with bipolar disorder., This means it has a strong genetic component and tends to run in families. Therefore, it is not the fault of your family member any more than it would be if hey had a medical condition. Bipolar Disorder is not something your family member can control through will-power alone., There are two main types of bipolar disorder, Bipolar I Disorder and Bipolar II Disorder. It is important to identify which type your family member has to understand their particular symptoms and behaviors.   Bipolar I is evidenced by a person experiencing manic episodes that typically last a week or longer. Some symptoms of a manic episode include: heightened/irritable mood, exaggerated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, and engaging in risky behaviors (such as gambling or having unprotected sex with multiple partners).Bipolar II is evidenced by at least one major depressive episode as well as a least one hypomanic episode (similar to a manic episode, but less severe and can last as little as four days)., Bipolar disorders are typically treated with a combination of medication and therapy. Psychiatrists or general practitioners often prescribe mood stabilizers such as Lithium to reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Psychologists, Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) and other clinicians typically assist the individual with bipolar disorder in managing and coping with their symptoms. Typical types of therapies include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family Therapy, and Interpersonal Therapy., Family members of individuals with bipolar disorder may experience burden and lack of energy. Additionally, spouses of individuals with bipolar disorder may experience a lack of support, and many do not seek help.If a family member believes that the person with bipolar has control over their illness this can lead to feelings of burden and dissatisfaction with the relationship.	Understand that some of your family member’s behaviors are linked to the disorder. Support your family member in their mental health treatment. Help monitor medication compliance. Assist during a manic or hypomanic episode. Plan for a crisis. Help your family member avoid triggers. Exercise compassion. Practice empathy. Focus on your own mental health. Consider professional help. Recognize that bipolar disorder is a biologically based condition. Understand the different symptoms of bipolar disorder. Understand how bipolar disorder is treated. Gain education on the typical effects of bipolar disorder on the family.

Often these stores will sell used instruments at a lower price. Employees will be well-versed in instrument quality and be able to help you choose a guitar based on your experience and budget.  Even if a music store does not sell used instruments, chat with the employees about your search. They may know used bass guitar sellers nearby or tell you more about what to look for in a used instrument. Contact local instrument repair stores as well. Their employees may know of a used guitar seller, or they may even be willing to renovate a used bass guitar for you at a reasonable price.  Check thrift stores in your area for used bass guitars. Often players will donate their old guitars in decent condition. Bass guitars at thrift stores are not usually in perfect condition, but they are often cheaper. You never know what surprise buy you might find in a thrift store., Flea markets and pawn shops can also be an inexpensive place to buy an instrument. Check for flea market listings in your town and ask vendors if they know of any instrument sellers. Pawn shops also sell items in good condition for a low price, much like thrift stores.  Often pawn shops sell used vintage instruments at a low price. If you are an experienced player, a vintage bass guitar might be of interest to you.

Do not allow the soil to dry out, as the plant cannot tolerate dry soil., Apply all-purpose, slow release fertilizer in early spring. This will encourage flowering., Provided the soil is right and the plant has adequate fertilizer, this plant will flower prolifically.  Flowering occurs for long periods. Flowers appear in clusters. Many are blue, while others are white, depending on the variety planted.  Early spring is the time to prune back cape plumbago. Remove the growth from the previous year, to encourage new growth in the next season.  If not pruned, the plant can get quite out of control. Expect a healthy bush to reach about 3 meters or 10 feet in height. Container plants must be pruned regularly to keep a neat and pleasant shape.	Keep well watered during the warmer months. Fertilize. Expect flowering in late spring and well into summer. Prune.
Do you want to consider taking up a career as a professional artist full time? Do you just want to take on this activity as a hobby part time? These are very important questions to ask yourself before you design your creative workroom. After this you'll need to consider what kind of creative work you'll be doing and what mediums (materials) you'll be using.  Tailor your arts and craft studio to your own needs and preferences. Some artist for example work best in total chaos and mess. Others work best in organization and peace.The steps in this article are really only a starting off point. You can always look through art studio sites, read magazines and books or watch videos and show on the subject to get ideas. It can also do good to chat with an artist who does similar art work or work that inspire you and chat with that person for tips advice and ideas. Different materials and procedures also require different settings. A paint project usually needs more space than a pastel or colored pencil. Colored pencils and pens don't require much space and can be carried out efficiently in a spare small room. If the majority of your art takes place outdoors or away from home, like on location, you might just need to room to store finished pieces and a nice way to tote materials to the location. Sometimes an artist just needs a retreat all their own from everybody or a safe place where the kids or pets don't have access to things like paints, sewing machines, and materials. Sometimes artists need to have all their supplies in one place. Sometimes an art studio is just a place to storage art and craft supplies.; , It's best not to try to make a shared part of the home or a major living area like the bedroom, kitchen an art craft studio. Toxic art materials if not handled correctly may end up contaminating the food, being eaten by accident or the artist burning that nights dinner. The living room or family activity can work if the artist can find quiet time away from the noise and distractions of other members. It can became really distracting and stressful for the artist and others the person lives with. Creating an art studio in the bedroom will cause problems not only with the sleeping partner but can cause sleeping problems for the artist. Also if you work at home or use the home office, crafts or arts can distract you from getting an important job done.  No spare room? You can also just invest in a nice modern craft station and/or easel and use that one place to use as an art studio. You can also further separate from the room with boundaries like houseplants, shelves or hanging fabric from the ceiling. Place it in the corner somewhere in a room. Just have a place to storage art supplies away when not in use.  You need to not only think about what materials you are using but other additional supplies you are going need and how are you going to store and work with them.  Painting for example can easily go well beyond paints as the career progresses. Where are easels, canvases, paper, or big bottles of gesso going to go? Also many painters also in time will want to use another technique or new material. Each new container of paint takes up space. If one takes up sewing there is a possibility that maybe another additional sewing machine that does a completely different function from the one that person already owns will need to be stored along with the first one . If you plan on photographing and blogging your artwork plan a place to store and keep the camera and computer. Another thing to consider is that some materials need to be stored under special conditions. Many glues and some paints can't be placed in cold temperatures, some fabrics can't be placed in full sunlight. Some drawing medias like pencils, chalks, pastels, charcoals will get brittle and dry in exposed locations. Others will melt in moist humid locations. There a many locking and air tight solutions in the food storage department of many stores that can easily solve many of these problems.  Kind in mind that some materials may have sticky vapors that will cling to walls and ceilings and form "blobs" that are impossible to get off.  Chalks, charcoals, and some kinds of pastels can get very dusty and coat anything it touches. Cover sensitive objects and surfaces with protective covers or place these delicate items in containers.   Many paints and glues give off fumes when your working with them and need to be used in a well-ventilated room such one with an open window. Also many craft materials can cause problems with health if ingested or if the material gets on the skin. Chalk dust can also cause sneezing and coughing.Some paint pigments are also toxic if ingested or absorbed through skin. When doing any art or crafts that require heat like using a hot glue gun, melting wax or wood burning make sure there is ventilation or cooling available so the room temperature is comfortable. This also includes working with machines that get hot while in operation. Anytime heat or electricity is involved have an fire extinguisher ready to go.  The space doesn't have to be huge but it should be adequate enough to do whatever it is you're doing.  Any artist can make masterpieces in any size room however the artist shouldn't have to bump their head or hands on the walls or ceiling. Consider whether a room is big enough for you to move around freely in as well as doing artistic activities.There should also be ample room to spread an adequate amount of your supplies out in one place instead of having to go back and forth getting supplies. The smaller the space, also the higher the concentration of fumes and smells coming from the paints in the room in most cases. Small rooms can also be noisy when using loud equipment. You can use small working places more efficiently by prioritizing your projects and with good placement of materials and workstations. When you are painting and don't have a lot pf room you may for instance get only the colors you are using for the step your doing now and as the paint dries up get your colors ready for the next step. Many awkward small nooks can hold many great storage or activity spots like storing the washing solution bucket and containing the splatters to one spot. A small room can also encourage an artist to leave the room more frequently and take a break. Big rooms can be overwhelming. The size of a room might make an artist take on too much or too big of a project because the artist feels it needs to be full. Also it's easy to get involved in too many different projects at one time. Bigger rooms also need more maintenance, lighting and cleaning.  This is not just the paints and brushes.But also the worktable, canvas, easel, paint thinner, palette and drop clothes. A crafts person will also need more than one kind of glue for different crafts. Safety equipment and first aid kits are great in case something goes wrong., Or at least consider going to a professional art store for more traditional versions. There are many relatively inexpensive worktables that are sleek and stylish made of tempered glass and steel. These often also will have drawers and pockets to easily place your pencils, paints etc. A glass table is also good for tracing things without the having to use projector all the time.Tables that tilt at angles are also good. Wood tables can also be a great choice with some of the features as above.   Get a workstation that's the correct height and width. You don't want to be crammed into a corner without ample room to stretch and move about nor should you have to stretch out of shape to reach supplies. Don't forget to have comfortable seating.  It's best to pick a nice clean white with no other colors.  Picking any other color may cause trouble. Dark colors will absorb lights and make the room darker which is not appropriate for most crafts. Picking any other color besides white will reflect that particular color unto the project affecting it's colors and your project will turn out different colors in a different room or outside. You can always decorate the other parts of the room with your favorite colors keeping the white dominant.  Excellent lighting is the fundamental of a well designed art studio.  Too much can be just as bad as too much. Poor lighting makes it difficult to do fine details in the work like adding the fine strands of hair to an oil painting or stitching on glass beads to a lace linen. Too much lighting causes glare (reflections off shiny items) and can make colors look faded. Both scenarios will cause eye problems and eyestrain. Choose your light color correctly. Light colors like paint will affect the tones and hues of your projects and materials. Not all light bulbs and colors are created equal. "Warm white" with yellow in it like candlelight or traditional lights can fade colors and make them look duller. "Cool white" with blue in it is said to be the artist light because electric companies claim it enhances the colors of the materials.This white color is also called daylight. There is also one called "pure white" which has no colors in it and it's the same color as bright white typing paper. The best option in light is a cool white or a good quality pure white. Consider cool LED bulbs for detail up close lighting. Incandescent, Fluorescent or Halogen lighting can get extremely hot and make it uncomfortable to work around. LED also perhaps won't hurt most materials sensitive to light. Natural light may or may not be good. The tones of light the sun gives to a room not only varies by the time of day but by many factors. Morning light has more blue in it than Dusk or Sunset light. The storm clouds and also pollution can color the sun an infinite array of colors.Also the colors of things around the window can influence colors in the room.   Keep materials organized in appropriate containers. Categorize your materials by brand, type, material or by project. There many specific containers for specific materials. Some storage containers also have locks to keep unwanted guests or curious pets and kids out of potentially dangerous materials. Don't just dump materials in a huge box or plastic bin. It's practically creating a pile of mess in a box that one has to dig about like a pirate searching for treasure. Don't also put loads of different tiny boxes in one huge container.It's much better to keep lots of smaller boxes on shelves. Save the big bin for larger items.This also will save on straining the muscles and hands. Think beyond the craft stores when it comes to storage. Many times a hardware or tool shop will have storage solutions often at lower prices and have more possibilities. Tool boxes and chest can provide roomier storage than a tiny plastic case. Pegboards, wine racks, hangers for clothes, can become great solutions for awkward items. Many common place containers that are dark colored like iodine glass bottles after rinsing off can help keep sunlight sensitive liquids from being damaged. A great way to store things like colored pencils, markers, pens, crochet hooks, is to create a carousel storage compartment or buy one. Get a lazy Susan at any home decorator shop or cake stand that rotates and use plastic storage cylinders or food cans properly rinsed and cleaned or cups and mugs and place your items in there. Old CD and DVD spindle cases can also be used for many storage solutions.If the compartments of the carousel are not permanently built in there's a great advantage of flexibility and more options.       Consider using vertical shelving for small lightweight items. Flat storage up against the walls will save on valuable floor place. Don't put heavy items on high shelves. Heavy items should be placed on lower shelves and at shorter distances from your workstation.   Consider having a portable form of a workstation or table. Whether it has doilies (wheels) or one of those tables that fold up or let the user change the dimensions of the table. Invest in adjustable shelving systems. These are better options than more traditional shelves because as your creative taste change you can change the space as well. Also if the room has to become a child's room or you need a guest room it easily be converted into another different place. Give your studio a nice place for lounging. Sometimes you might want to look at the works you created with a cup of tea, play on your Android while waiting for the paint to dry or use your studio as a restful retreat to catnap.  It's important to have a place to keep samples of materials and all your little notes. It's important for any creative person to have access to color or fabric swatches, inspirations, notes, tutorials.  Keep your color swatches, fabric swatches in real not digital form. Even the best computer screen can not display all colors accurately nor can it display finishes or textures. There is no such thing as "feel-a-vision" yet. Also the display settings on any computer can vary causing colors to look different among different screens. Keep you color swatches in a sheltered place. Some materials are easily faded by exposure to moisture, dust, air or the sun. This also prevents paint or glue from spilling on those precious swatches. Use the computer and it's many ways of storage to store things like detailed instructions, store information, magazine articles, model numbers. Many manuals are also downloadable via .pdf format online. (option) Looking at what you achieved can be awarding and inspire you to be more creative. If your home lacks room to display your finished pieces use your own craft room as a display room as well. This is your place to be yourself in purest form. Don't be afraid to change the display as needed or as you wish. Display your finished works in your studio as you wish.  Be sure to protect painted or stained projects with the appropriate sealer that is waterproof. Also store these things in appropriate containers. Place paper works in an acid free album or frame with acid free mounting inside. Acid in some framing materials (also fabrics) will cause them to age quickly and become yellowed, discolored or have fine cracks in the material. Store your finished projects in appropriate containers to ensure that they will last for a long time.  Making messes is inevitable in an art craft studio and it's best to keep surfaces safe and clean as possible. If the room or floor is not really in good shape or you're into the spill design trend you can skip this step.  When doing a potential messy craft or painting cover the surfaces of the work station with a drop cloth. Use weather tarp, drop clothes or even rags to keep your surfaces clean and usable. When using things like glitter or beads that can be messy getting all over place, keep these medias in a container such as a paper plate and keep a properly sized funnel so they don't roll or fall all over the place. Keep the container being used in another container rather than on the main surface glitter and beads can also be returned to the original container saving inventory and money. This also is a great way to keep crumbly messes to a minimum. Have anything thing you need handy for cleaning up the media in case of a spill. Water washable material can only needs a nicely sized pail of water or access to a sink.   Don't buy what you really don't need! Many of the "useful" items like, the colored pencil storage case or that carrying tote for brushes will sometimes just get in the way. Also it's not really necessary to buy huge containers of paint, or multitudes of the same color if your doing only a small project. Paints and glues will loss their quality very often when first opened. It's also easy to forget which identical glue container is already opened or brand new. Tame those cords, ribbons, wires, threads and chains. It's best to keep long items on a reel like a thread is on a spool. If these are not storage correctly prepare yourself for a jungle of tangled mess and tripping hazards. Try to also keep those electric wires or air gun hoses under wraps with wire organizational products. You might want to use portable, chargeable, battery operated equipment to minimize cord hassles. Do not keep old catalogs from art stores after a year or two! Prices and products change very often. Many hobby and craft magazines have their articles online somewhere on the web or are often revamps of older articles and information written somewhere else or on a video site like Youtube. These subscriptions can get annoying and costly for the artist in the form of mental and spacial clutter. Before you subscribe to or buy that book or magazine make sure it's not available in some other more convenient, neater form. Also many magazines only describe the project in the magazine and then the reader has to go online to get the instructions. Place paper in a container that keeps it from folding/rolling up the edges (becoming dog eared).  Good labeling that is easy to spot and read will help keep you organized and prevent costly mistakes caused by confusion. If you are a visual person who keeps organization better with pictures use photos or drawings on the storage container. Keep different categories of things in different color containers in a color code system or simply put all similar colors in it's own container or section of the container.  Also if you use more than one of anything that looks very similar like unlabeled crochet hooks, make sure to label them or use a color code system with a color key written down. A color key tells what each color means.Green can be for synthetic brushes and blue for natural brushes. Good labeling also help you seperate your identical paper scissors from your fabric scissors if necessary. Nail enamel or a thin colored tape works great for this purpose. Do not put any important thing of the studio in a nondescript , unlabeled or poorly labeled bag or box! It's too easy to assume such a container has nothing important in it and later realize that that box or bag going to the trash plant has your new ordered paper or finished project you love so much!

In order to enjoy the most color from your paper rainbow rose, choose a square of paper with a rainbow print on the front and back.  You could also choose a square sheet of paper with a white side, plain color side, or a pattern on the opposite side. Play around with different types of paper to find the look you like best.       Origami paper works especially well. The standard size for origami paper is 9 by 9 inches (23 by 23cm).       If starting with plain white paper, you can use crayons or colored pencils to color a rainbow pattern over the entire sheet of paper. For best results, try layering the colors diagonally across the square from one corner to the opposite corner.  Start from the middle of one edge and begin to cut a circle into the square paper, coming as close to the other three edges as possible.   Do not yet cut the edges off at this point.  Once you get close to the starting point of your circle, shift the cutting line in by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Continue cutting around the inner perimeter of your spiral until you reach the center.   The thickness of the spiral should be similar all the way around, meaning that the approximate thickness of the spiral should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) evenly.       Cut the spiral free-hand. You do not need to be precise with this technique. In fact, this rose looks best when you maintain a principle of “wabi-sabi,” a Japanese aesthetic focused on the beauty of the imperfect.  At the end of the spiral, which should fall out at the exact center, you will naturally end up with a little tab that looks a little wider than the thickness of the spiral.   The tab should be fairly circular with a slight notch in it.  Snip off the outside square shape simply by cutting it off at the point where you began your spiral circle shape.   The sharp angles and edges of this section will only get in the way of the final rose shape.    As you start, the roll should be as tight as possible. Use both hands to roll up the paper spiral. Hold the developing roll in between two fingers on one hand and use your other hand to maneuver the remaining paper around the roll to incorporate it.       Initially, the final roll will look very tight and not very rose-like.       Adjust the tightness of the spiral. Slowly release the tension holding the spiral together, allowing the roll to loosen and unravel slightly while still maintaining its basic form. Let the tension drop less for a tighter roll and let it drop more for a looser rose.  Add a drop of hot glue onto the top-side of the tab and firmly press it against the bottom of the rose. Make sure that each spiral is caught on the glue.   Make sure to use hot glue or a glue that dries almost instantly.       You also need to make sure that the edge of each spiral sticks to the glue. Otherwise, the rose may unravel once you release it.       As soon as the glue dries, set the rose down. Your paper rainbow rose should be complete.	Select a square of rainbow paper. Cut the beginning of a circle shape. Divert the circle into a spiral. Cut a tab shape into the center of the spiral. Remove the outside square. Roll up the spiral from the outside in.Roll the entire spiral up toward its center, rolling along the top-side of the paper. Glue the tab to the bottom of the rose. Repeat to make more!
Locate the holes towards the tops of the feathers, but not too close to the edges (otherwise they risk ripping).; , Use the pliers for this part; if you have two pairs, you can hold the ring in one pair and use the other pair to open it up.  There should be two rings for each feather, to allow for some room between the hook and the feather itself.  You should now have two feathers ready to be attached to the French hooks.  Slide each one onto each outer jump ring, then clamp them closed with your pliers. The feathers should now dangle from the hooks.  You're done!  ,	Create a small hole in each feather using the needle or piercing tool. Twist open the jump rings. Insert the jump rings into the feathers. Close the outer jump rings. Open up the hooked ends of the French hooks. Shake them out a little to make sure the hooks and rings are firmly attached. Finished.
Use painting pads instead of brushes or rollers. They will give you a smoother surface, and they are usually the same width as common baseboards, so you can paint the baseboard from top to bottom with one stroke.       ; , This type of paint will clean easily if you get scuff marks on the boards.  You can use standard masking tape, but be careful because standard masking tape can pull the paint off of the walls. There are many specialty masking tapes that you can buy at any hardware store. Ask a store employee to help.  The object is to avoid getting paint on the walls while you are paining the baseboards.  Tape the plastic down with your masking tape, right where the baseboard meets the floor. You've now masked the baseboard.  Push the paint pad into the paint, so that just the sponge part of the pad is covered in paint. Scrape the excess paint off of the pad by running it over the edge of the tray.  You should be able to paint about 4 feet (1.2 m) of baseboard with each dip in the paint.  Run the pad along the baseboard until the entire baseboard is painted. Make sure you overlap your strokes, and that each new section is blended together.  That should give your baseboards time to dry.	To get beautiful looking baseboards quickly, you need to use the right supplies. Use standard latex paint for your baseboards. Mask the baseboards. To mask the baseboards, run a strip of tape along the top where the baseboard meets the wall. Lay some 4mm gauge plastic on the floor, running it around the edge of the baseboard. Pour 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of paint into a paint tray. Holding the pad vertically, run the pad along the baseboard. Keep dipping the pad into the paint. Wait at least 4 hours before pulling off the masking tape.
Yes, like you're using the restroom. Hold your breath while trying this a few times until you get used to the feeling. Don't over-do it.; , Hiss like a snake and try to do it from your diaphragm. Try doing this as long as you can or until you run out of air.  Practice letting out a little bit of breath at a time. At first, it'll sound like you're grunting, as you breathe in push your stomach out to have more air for belting a note.  Keep trying different methods of letting the air out. You don't want to release too much air, or you'll be off no use on stage.  To distort the scream, just do like when you burp, but without burping; just pushing air constantly through the throat.  Use your diaphragm, and feel where your throat is straining to control the pitch. The wider your mouth, the easier it is to scream high. The more round you make your mouth, the easier the lows come.  The best way to learn is to scream harmonies with your favorite bands. I say harmonies because you won't sound like other screamers yet, especially not good ones. If you're screaming harmonies, you can hear your own voice and learn how without getting discouraged because you don't match the lead singer's voice.	Bear down. Hiss. Breathe. Control your tone. Distort. The wider, the higher. Scream to music.
Start with a card that says all the words you need to. Put your messages where you want them to go, so you know where your center design will go. Make sure nothing you want to be visible will be underneath your centerfold design.; , Picture a spot around the centerfold that you want to be covered by flowers. Draw a rough outline around this spot so you know what spots it will cover. It should start at the bottom of the card and extend upwards and outwards, like the shape of an ice cream cone.  You don't want your centerfold flower to be wider than your card. Fold your card shut and measure the width.The widest part of the pop out flower should not be more than this amount.  The top dimension should be no wider than your card's width (when closed). You can make a centerfold design much smaller than this, however. As long as your design is not wider than the width of the card, folded, you can place it at any height on the centerfold.  This is where you use markers or construction paper to create a design. It is advisable to make it symmetrical, but you don't need to. Keep track of the design you will want to cut out of the top once you have finished drawing the design.   After you're done, cut any excess paper from the top and sides. Erase and pencil marks you made to plan for the centerfold design. Fold your design in half.  Lay out your card and your centerfold design. Line up your centerfold design with the crease of your card. Rubber cement will hold your centerfold the best, but standard glue will work as well. It will make your card more secure to fold an inch along edges of the triangle so it doesn't come off the card., You want to fold the triangle the opposite direction of the way the card folds. In other words, if you open the card, the triangle should pop out toward you. Now glue the flowers on the triangle. If they are going over the center crease of the triangle, fold them as well so they will not get damaged when the card closes.  Once the glue holding on the triangle and flowers have dried, carefully close your card. When it is opened again, the flowers will pop up. The centerfold flower is different from the regular pop out flower.	Create your design. Draw an inverted triangle on your card. Measure the dimensions of your centerfold flower. Cut a triangle out of construction paper. Draw your design. Glue the edges of the centerfold to your card. Crease the center of the triangle and glue on flowers. Carefully close your card.
One thing that almost all pop stars have in common is a wholesome factor – at least when they were first starting out. You can look at Justin Bieber, early Miley Cyrus, the members of N*SYNC, Britney on the cover of ...Baby One More Time, or pretty much any pop star, to see that they all have a level of wholesomeness, a virginal glow, and a general vibe that they won’t do anything worse than staying out past curfew. Though it gets more complicated when you see that this look also has to come with a healthy dose of sex appeal, focus on the wholesomeness at first.People want a pop star who they can relate to, not someone who is so stylish, or so much of a bad boy or bad girl, that they have nothing in common. Remind your audience that you’re not so different from the boy or girl next door. Keep in mind that pop stars tend to appeal to an audience of teenagers or even pre-teens. You want parents to be okay with sending their kids to your concerts, don’t you?; , To be a perfect pop star, you have to be able to add a layer of sex appeal to that layer of wholesomeness that you exude. You have to be a little bit sexy, or at least to have the potential of sexiness, if you really want to make it big. It’s tricky to find a balance between being wholesome and having sex appeal, but all you have to do is to find a way to show a little bit of skin and maturity without giving up your self-respect. Think of Britney on her first album cover – she was dressed as a schoolgirl while also bearing her midriff. Find a way to be a little bit fun and flirty without looking too adult at the same time.   Bare a little bit of skin so your fans can see your sexy side. That said, you shouldn’t have to show more skin than you’re comfortable with. You don’t have to bare it all to get people to like you. Sex appeal is more than just baring your midriff or giving the cameras a suggestive smile. It also has to do with carrying yourself in a way that shows you’re confident and happy with how you look and what you have to offer. Stand up straight, look ahead instead of down at the floor, and don’t cross your arms over your chest or look displeased with your physical self. Part of sex appeal is mastering the art of flirting. When you talk to people, whether they are interviewers or fellow stars, you should be a little bit playful, suggestive, and fun. Don’t completely let your guard down, but be open to being flirtatious.  Of course, not every pop star in the history of music has been blessed with having the voice of an angel. Still, if you want to make it last, you have to start with a baseline of strong vocal chords, and to have range, too. You can take voice lessons and work on improving the talent you already have, but if you start with nothing, it’ll be hard to end up with something. Sure, some pop stars are famous for their lack of talent, their lip-syncing, or their computer-generated voices, but you want to be better than that. Think of Mariah or Whitney – no one has ever accused them of not having a voice.   This will require you to be honest with yourself and to get some feedback. Ask your friends or mentors to give you an honest assessment of your talent. Of course, if you really believe that you have what it takes, then you shouldn’t let other people get you down or tell you who you are. But if everyone is telling you that you’re missing out on the strong vocal chords, then it may be time to rethink your plan. If you’re going through puberty or have yet to go through it, keep in mind that your voice can change. Boys who have sweet, higher voices before puberty may end up with deeper voices after it. This doesn’t mean that your voice will change for the worse, but that you should be prepared for the change.  You don’t need to have moves like Michael Jackson to be a successful pop star. However, it does help to start with a baseline of solid rhythm, and to know how to move to a beat. If you have two left feet, though, don’t think that this disqualifies you from being the next Selena Gomez. The most important thing you need to have is a willingness to learn and the rest will follow. You should take dance classes to get your basic rhythm down, and be prepared to work with a dance instructor after you reach stardom. Another thing you’ll need is coordination – you’ll need to be able to sing and strut around on stage.   The most important thing is confidence. If your dance instructor or team see that you’re struggling, they’ll work on giving you a few simple moves that you can work with. If you can rock a few easy moves, you’ll be just fine. The important thing is that you’re willing to learn and that you’re not embarrassed about stepping out of your comfort zone to achieve greatness.  Another important part of being a pop star is to be persistent. Just like any career in the arts, luck and determination is half the battle. Just because your first attempt at getting your work out there or getting signed by an agent doesn’t lead to much, it doesn’t mean that you should give up and find a new career path. Instead, it takes a whole lot of rejection to get to where you are, and even the most famous stars, like Madonna, had to start by waiting tables and waiting to get a big break. If you really want to follow this dream, then you have to be prepared for the rejection that comes with it.   That is to say, if you really want to be a pop star, then you need to develop some thick skin. You have to be sure about who you are and what you have to offer if you want to make it anywhere, or you’ll let other people break you before you get a big chance. If you’re really sensitive, vulnerable, and self-conscious, then you have to work on improving your self-esteem before you move forward.  Being a pop star means being criticized in the tabloids, for everything from gaining two pounds to being accused of having an affair. You’ll have to be able to face annoying and untrue gossip and to treat it as part of the game. If you doubt yourself every time someone questions your fashion choices or questions your current relationship, then you won’t be able to make it out there. Instead, you have to learn to accept the praise, to learn from the constructive criticism, and to push aside the rest of the pointless hate if you want to succeed. You have to love who you are and to believe in yourself if you want to make it out there.   It’s not a stereotype that many pop stars get broken down in the face of fame. The endless criticism is too much for many of them to face. This means that you have to have healthy ideas about who you are and what makes you unique before you let the tabloids eat you alive. Even the most confident pop stars doubt themselves now and again. However, starting off with little confidence will make it hard for you to stay strong. If you know you need to work on your confidence, you should do that as much as you can before you through yourself into stardom.  Some people think that all you have to do once you make it big as a pop star is to flash a big smile, wear cute outfits, and go clubbing. However, real talent takes hard work, and if you’re committed to being a star with staying power, then you have to be able to put in the hours every single day. It’s like having a day job, only harder. You’ll often have to put in eight or more hours a day to recording songs, practicing your dance moves, rocking out at concerts, promoting yourself, maintaining a social media presence, and just making sure that you’re doing the best you can.   If you like to sleep in, slack off, or spend the majority of your time watching TV or hanging out with friends, then being a pop star may not be in the cards for you. If you want to keep growing as a star, then you can’t settle for less than the best. You’ve got to not only make sure to perfect the moves and lyrics you’ve got, but to always work on taking it to the next level. Your audience won’t stay with you if you’re just producing the same beats again and again. They’ll want you to grow and evolve to keep things interesting. And that takes work.  This does not mean that you have to be cookie-cutter hot and to have a perfect body to be a pop star, either. However, it does mean that your look has to stand out in some way. Think of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, or Pitbull – often, it’s more important to have a distinct look that intrigues people and makes them remember you instead of being traditionally attractive. So, if you don’t think you’re classically good looking, you can find something else that makes you stand out, whether it’s a few key piercings, loud fashion, high heels, or a unique hairdo. You shouldn’t force an image that doesn’t feel comfortable for you just to stand out, but you should find something that makes you distinctive.   Pop stars are also often reinventing themselves again and again. You can find a look that makes you stand out, but then work within it to keep things interesting. Lady Gaga, for example, is always recognizable though she is constantly changing her hair, style, and general look to keep things interesting.  If you’ve got what it takes, then the next thing you’ve got to do is to flaunt it. Being talented, cute, and determined isn’t enough if you want to make it big. If you want to get anywhere in this world, then you have to be prepared to promote yourself by networking. This may feel sleazy or not genuine to you, but that’s just the way you’ve got to play the game. Take every opportunity you can to meet with producers, other artists, dancers, song writers, or people who are connected in the industry.   Accept invitations to parties, put yourself out there, and be assertive when introducing yourself to new people without being annoying. Swallow your pride and talk to people who maybe normally wouldn’t be your cup of tea to get your name out there and to find future opportunities, and you’ll be more likely to make a name for yourself. It may feel unnatural to talk to people to let them know who you are, but you shouldn’t feel like you’re above it. Unfortunately, it’s rare that you can get by on talent alone, and you’ll need to do some extra work if you want to get noticed. A big part of networking these days is having a strong social media presence. Have a Twitter account with daily tweets, create a Facebook fan page, and stay on top of your web page and Instagram account. The sad fact of the matter is, if you’re not making connections online and posting frequently, then people may forget about you.  Applying to talent contests is a great way to put yourself out there and to get noticed. You should look out for local contests in your area, which are a great way to put your name out there and to give yourself some practice in competing with others. This can be especially helpful if you’re living in a small town and want to make it big. However, if you’re really committed, then you should move to a city like New York or LA, and try out for some bigger contests, such as America’s Got Talent, The Voice, American Idol, or whatever else is out there. The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to succeed.   Of course, it’s not likely that you’ll win American Idol the first time you apply to a talent contest. That’s not the point. The point is that you get used to the fact that you’ll be competing with people and putting yourself out there.  If you want to be a pop star, then you’ve got to record your music. Wowing a director of a talent contest isn’t enough. If you write your own songs, then you should write and then record them to show producers what you’ve got. Though making a professional recording can be costly, you should try to pony up – or raise money to do so – for some time in a professional studio so that your recording is as clean and impressive as possible. You can start by recording a single or go for a whole album if you feel like you have enough material to do so. This is an important step on the path to making it big.   If you’re thinking of recording your music in a professional studio, then you should practice on your own so you’re prepared when you have to get in the studio. You don’t want to waste any time, since a trip to the studio will be expensive.  Once you’ve got a recording of your music, it’s important to send it out to producers so you can start to make it big. If you can get yourself hooked up with an agent before doing this, then great, but if you have to do this yourself, it’s important to do it right. Ask around and do your research to send your music to producers who are looking for new talent, and who work with performers who do work that is similar to yours, but not too similar. Make sure you’ve described yourself well and that your music is packaged professionally.   Be persistent. Just because a few producers have rejected your work, it doesn’t mean you should stop sending it out. In fact, it means that you should try even harder. That said, if multiple producers are giving you the same feedback, you should see if there’s a grain of truth in it. If you think there’s something you can do to change your sound to make it more appealing to future producers and fans, you should take that leap before sending it out more.  If you want to achieve your dream, then you have to create a strong online presence. You can do this before you make it big, in order to show that you already have fans and that there are many people who are interested in you and your work. You can create interesting content, post at least once a day to stay current, and work on amassing hundreds, or even thousands, of followers. You can post YouTube singles, have a blog as part of your website, post photos of yourself, and just do whatever you can to make yourself known.   If a producer or agent is interested in you, it’s likely that they will Google you pretty fast. You’ll want them to see that you’re a professional who is already thinking of marketing him or herself, and that you’ve really put a lot of thought into putting yourself out there.  Though it’s important to achieve your dream, you shouldn’t give up your studies completely to do it. It’s important to dream big but to also be realistic, and just in case things don’t work out, you don’t want to be without a backup plan. Whether you stay in school or hire a tutor or keep up your studies yourself while you try to make it big, it’s important to keep learning so that you’re still getting an education while you move forward in your career.   You don’t want to find yourself at the age of college students without getting anything resembling a high school education; this is valuable learning time that will be hard to make up. This doesn’t mean that you’re admitting you won’t make it. It just means that you’re being smart about your future.  If you’re lucky enough to have made it big as a pop star, then you have to make sure to keep a good head on your shoulders. You will find yourself surrounded by new friends and acquaintances who you wouldn’t have met in your everyday life. Some of them will be genuine, caring people, just like you, while others are just hangers-on who only spend time with you for personal gain. It’s important to be slow to trust people, to take your time to get to know new friends, and not to spill any big secrets when you’re just getting to know people. This will help you find people who like you for you, not for your fame.   Though it may not feel natural to keep your guard up when meeting new people, it’s important to do this to protect yourself. Ask yourself if your new friends are really interested in getting to know you, or if they just want to go to your fun parties or vacation with you. The same goes for new significant others. Make sure you’re dating people who want to get to know who you are, not just who want to be seen in the tabloids with you, or to use you to promote their own fashion line.  Being a pop star isn’t all about going on ritzy vacations and tweeting photos of yourself in a bikini. It takes hard work, long hours, and plenty of sweat. If you’ve made it big, then being a pop star is a 24/7 job and there is no such thing as a real vacation. You constantly not only have to work on your craft, your music, and your dance moves, but you have to work on maintaining a positive public image, and on reminding people that you do matter. If you’re really cut out for the lifestyle, then you have to put in the hours.   Even when you’re out at clubs, award shows, or parties, you still have to think of it as working because it’s important to keep up a good public image. Getting drunk or fighting in public is a bad career move, and you have to work on being on your best behavior full time, because there’s no vacation from keeping up a good image.  Though it’s important to create an image and to remind people of how relevant you are, you can’t do the same old thing day after day, especially if you grow up a lot as you become a pop star. Sure, being an innocent girl or boy-next door is a great way to start, but if you’ve matured significantly as an artist, or have just become interested in exploring other sides of your talent, then it’s important to switch up your game.   Think of Justin Timberlake, who began as a wholesome pop star with bleached blonde curls, who is now in the throes of a fantastic R&B career. If you’re sick of singing the same old songs, then you’ve got to find a new way to be you – with a kick. Of course, you still have to stay true to something that your fans love about you. Doing a complete career switch, like moving from country music to rap, may lead you to lose too many fans. Find a way to still be you while adding some more dynamic changes to your routine.  If you’re really committed to being a pop star, then you have to be prepared for all of the negativity, the gossip, and the rumors. People will say the worst and most untrue things possible just to get you down and make you doubt yourself, and you have to learn to avoid what the tabloids say, whether they claim you’re pregnant or are in rehab when you’re not. Some celebrities just flat-out don’t read the tabloids, while others use their social media expertise to fight back. Whatever you chose to do, the most important thing is that you don’t let a bunch of ignorant people get you down or keep you from following your dreams.   Every single celebrity, even the most beloved of them, have had their fair share of dealing with gossip and rumors. Just think of it as an initiation process. Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to keep people from spreading rumors about you. However, you can control your reaction to all the hate.  The hardest part of being a pop star can be staying true to who you are. It can feel nearly impossible to be faithful to yourself when there are a million voices in your head telling you what to do and who to be. The most important thing is that you never forget your initial dream and that you don’t end up acting and looking like a complete stranger. At the end of the day, it’s all about being happy with the work that you’ve done, and in affecting your fans in a positive way. Make sure you never forget the person you were before you reached stardom, and you’ll be able to stay true to yourself.  Though making new friends and starting new relationships is an important part of being a pop star, don’t forget your old friends or family members. They’re there to keep you grounded, and they’ll keep you from forgetting where you came from. Though it can be hard to find alone time when you’re a pop star, it’s important to make time to check in with yourself, to write in a journal, and to make sure that you’re achieving the goals you want to achieve. If you’re constantly surrounded by an entourage and are moving from one show to the next, you won’t be able to slow down and remember why you wanted to become a pop star in the first place.

Typically, agents are used for booking celebrities for an appearance, concert, endorsement, movie, or similar activities. Publicists deal with anything related to the public, like magazines articles, blogs, and interviews.  Agents, managers, and publicists each have their own parts that they represent for a celebrity. They handle the business and image aspects of the celebrity. There are a few different ways of getting in touch with these representatives. The best way is through email, and it is how most business deals are done with celebrities. Email allows for a paper trail, and it is the preferred method of contact for representatives. Phone is another route to take, but it is not the preferred route. Also its important to keep in mind that many representatives have assistants and gatekeepers, so you will likely be unable to reach the representative by phone. By snail mail isn't a feasible option unless you are sending free product to someone. Even doing this, you want to have spoken through the representative through email or by phone. Please note that representatives are only to be reached out to for business and publicity inquiries, not for fan mail. Celebrities change representatives frequently. You can monitor these changes through booking agent info databases. A celebrity’s manager is involved in all aspects of their career. Less known celebrities may only have a manager. These people are generally very busy, but can help you contact your celebrity. You may be able to find manager, agent, or publicist information through your celebrity’s Facebook page. Look on your celebrity’s Internet Movie Database (IMDB) or Wikipedia page. You can often find publicist or management company information in these places. Then look up the publicist or management company contact information. , Depending on the contact information you’ve found, this could be a written letter or email. You might want to break the letter into two parts, one for the publicist and one for the celebrity. Be clear and to the point. Be straightforward in your request for a return message to prove your contact.   When addressing a publicist, manager, etc., you might want to say something like, “Thank you for helping us fans get in touch with so-and-so.” Include a request with your message when appropriate. It would be natural to ask a concert promoter, for example, for a ticket to a concert and a chance to meet the celebrity. Some celebrities have a considerable number of staff managing their public relations. If you have the contact information for a few of these, try them all. It’s unlikely these people will discuss amongst themselves fan mail they’ve read., It may take some time before you receive a response to your message. In some cases, you may get a “canned” response, where you receive a pre-made message that says something to the effect of, “The celebrity is too busy to respond to your message now.”   After a reasonable period of time has passed, like a few weeks to a month, try another means of contact. Aim to make yourself noticeable among other fans, but not overbearing.	Reach out to celebrities through their agent or publicist. Craft a suitable message. Send your message.
Use the same color as the pipe cleaner used for the body. To shape the wings:   Bend two more pipe cleaners into U shapes at each end, using the middle of the pipe cleaner as the dividing point for each U shape. Then, slightly kink the middle of the pipe cleaner, as shown. Reshape the U shapes into as wing-like a shape as possible.  To do this, wrap or fold the loose ends slightly around the body of the dragonfly, just enough to attach without taking away the wing shape. Make readjustments to the wing shape as needed.   For added effect, try pasting some colored tissue paper over the wings.  The dragonfly can now be displayed by hanging using invisible thread. Or simply place it on a shelf or add to a craft project.   If wearing as jewelry, attach a finding such as a brooch backing, using craft glue. Other uses include: Adding to a collage or picture, toys for children over 3, decorations on children's lunchboxes/bags/totes/water bottles, etc., attachments to gift cards or gift wrapping, a decoration for a small treasures box lid, etc.	Take two pipe cleaners to use for the long and graceful wings of the dragonfly. Twist the wings into position on the body. Display the dragonfly.
As the diagonal step is taken, pivot on the stationary foot a quarter turn to bring the diagonal foot such the it is a step’s distance behind the stationary foot. The body should then be standing with feet apart and facing a quarter turn to the left of the original position.  This is done similarly to the above but with a more dramatic pivot. A pivot of any degree between ⅛ and ¾ can actually be taken.  You can use various combinations of the basic turns to give the dance a more complex look.  You can dance an alternate of this basic step by switching the direction that the box moves, from left to right.  As you become better at the waltz, you may wish to try more complex steps. The waltz is a dance with a long history and a number of steps and turn combinations exist. Learn about whisks, hesitations, turns, and changes.	Add a quarter turn. Add a ⅜ turn. Use combinations. Switch to a Right Box step. Use more complicated steps.
Find a place to be alone. Sing through the song and don’t bottle up your feelings. Suppressing the urge to cry will just prolong your pain. Take the time to sing to yourself, being fully present in how you feel. Let the tears flow freely, and spend as much time doing this as you need. You may need a whole day, or even several days to get it all out. Treat the process with the same sincerity as you would a true grieving process. You deserve it! If you don’t invest time in releasing your intense feelings, they will continue bothering you when you perform.; , Take a break from singing and just listen to the song. If you can access other recordings, listen to as many versions of the song as possible. If no recordings are available, record yourself singing it once and just listen to that recording. Embrace the emotions that come over you as you listen. As intense or time-consuming as this process may be, your reward will be a deep insight into your emotional self. This will not just help the tears subside; you will likely start to heal from serious pain you still carry from past experiences. This will aid you on your quest to greater resilience.  Make sure you write about this valuable experience. Verbalize what you are feeling. Write down your thoughts and read them aloud to yourself. Feel free to share these thoughts with a trusted friend. Articulate what you’re feeling in the mirror. There is no such thing as coming to understand your feelings "too much", especially as a performer. Even if you think you are "over it" at this point, writing about your experience will help you preserve valuable insight for the future.  Sing the song and allow your emotions to manifest themselves as they will. If you are still crying at this point, don't fret. The sting will lessen with time. In the meantime, you will learn how to sing through your crying. This skill will rescue you in emergencies when you get emotional during performance.  If after cycling through these steps you still don’t feel better, do something else. Take out the trash. Go for a walk. Work out at the gym. Talk to a good friend. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Take a bubble bath. Do anything to get your mind off the song. A lively activity followed by relaxation could do wonders for you.  When you're ready to sing the song again, take some time to imagine yourself doing so successfully. Close your eyes and imagine yourself performing the song. Visualize yourself doing so successfully. What do you sound like? What do you look like? What do you see around you? Take note of as many other details as you can. Act like a little kid and draw what you see. Let your right brain indulge in this sensory experience.  By now you have let yourself cry it out, think deeply, take a break, and reflect about your experience. At this point, you have hopefully taken the edge off the pain you used to feel when singing this sad song. Go ahead. Sing it again and see what happens.  If your attempt to sing still makes you bawl, don’t give up. Repeat these steps in whatever order helps you the most. If your efforts seem futile, don’t be shy about seeking professional help. There may be unresolved issues that need addressing—not just so you can get through the song, but so you can live a happier life.	Cry it out. Let it wash over you. Write it out. Sing it over and over. Do something else. Meditate and draw. Try again. Rinse and repeat.
In a small bowl, pour 1 cup of salt. Add 1 cup of vinegar. Stir well so the salt soaks up all the vinegar. Continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and even.   Add a 1/2 cup of lemon juice and mix thoroughly to give your paste some extra declogging-power thanks to the juice’s acidity. If the clog is located deep within the pipe, or if you're leaving the lemon juice out, add more vinegar for a thinner mixture so it travels more easily.; , First, remove the drain's stopper. Then pour the mixture directly down the drain. Coat the entire drain so the whole clog is sure to absorb the mixture. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes so the clog can absorb as much as possible. For especially stubborn clogs, let the clog soak for 30 minutes.   If you are unable to remove the stopper, add more vinegar to the mixture before pouring so it's thinner.  Boil 2 cups of water with a kettle or pan. Then pour the water directly into the drain. Pour slowly to avoid splash-back, which may scald you. Also pour slowly so you can aim the water directly into the drain instead of splashing the basin, which may absorb the heat and cool the water on contact before it reaches the clog.   Use boiling water instead of running hot water from the tap, since it may take a while for the hot water to kick in.	Mix salt and vinegar. Pour the mixture into the drain. Rinse the drain with boiling water.
FHA-backed loans require that you have a minimum down payment of 3.5 percent. Your down payment may be higher based on the loan terms that you qualify for but it will not be less than 3.5 percent of the purchase price. You must provide income documentation high enough to cover the payments. FHA-backed loans also require that the home price falls under federally mandated geographic limits. The geographic limits vary by location and fluctuate with market standards. You can verify the geographic limits for the areas that you are considering by using this calculator: https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/hicostlook.cfm  You will also be required to pay a loan insurance premium (approximately 1.5 percent of the full value of the loan). You can only have 1 FHA loan at any time.; , You can act as your own representative but the paperwork and program complexities involved may be difficult unless you have previous real estate experience.    You will need to have your last 2 years of addresses, social security numbers, 2 years of employment information, current gross monthly salary, current check stubs, 2 years of past W-2 forms, 2 years of personal tax returns, current income statement, balance sheet for self-employed individuals, checking and savings account information, investment account information, and information on any existing loans. You will also need documentation on other real property that you possess, the estimated value of all your personal property, certificate of eligibility and DD-214 (veterans only).  These requirements are less stringent than they once were.   There are now FHA loans available to cover properties that require repairs. FHA 203(k) loans allow you to borrow up to $35,000 above the price of the house to make repairs. You may wish to have a professional inspection done to ensure that repairs needed will not exceed the amount allowable by the program that you applied for.    Unlike real estate transactions in the private sector, transactions that involve bank-owned properties generally take 2 to 3 months to close. You may have to wait 30 days or more before you find out if your offer has been accepted, rejected or whether a counter offer has been made. Once your offer has been accepted, you or your broker will coordinate with the closing company to arrange a closing date. The bank will typically be represented at the closing by the real estate agent who listed the property for them. Once all the paperwork has been signed, the sale will be complete.	Familiarize yourself with the different FHA backed programs and requirements. Consider hiring a real estate broker with FHA-backed loan and REO experience. Contact an FHA loan specialist at a local bank to get pre-approved for your loan. Locate a property that meets FHA standards. Submit your offer or if you hired a real estate broker, they will submit the purchase offer, escrow check and loan pre-approval letter to the bank or management company.
It is possible to start finding pathways to letting others help you.One of the best ways of doing this is to follow your first mind. The minute you have a conscious thought that you are facing something you cannot alone handle, seek out help. Don't take the time to talk yourself out of it. Remember to make a note of the solution you receive for your problem. This will help you when you face a similar situation again   When the thought crosses your mind that you could do with help sorting out a problem - carrying a heavy box, making dinner, working out a work dilemma, etc. - act on it. Decide who you will ask, phrase the request in your head, and go and ask for help.  If another person is being kind in offering help, accepting it at face value is the first step. Yes, there are people with bad intentions, but there are also those who want to do good by others. Look for those people in the world and stop focusing on the negative.   Seek out the goodness in others and restore your faith in humanity. An easy way to do this is by volunteering. Watching others give of themselves selflessly to assist those who are less fortunate is a terrific way to recognize the good in people. Volunteering also helps you to notice how people depend on one another within a community, and how all parts must work together to function as a whole., Choose wisely and carefully. Avoid people who make you feel like a lesser person in any way. Find people you really trust to try out asking for help first. This will allow you to open up bit by bit, and not be exposed to someone who might not do the right thing by you, or who might purposely make you feel weak for asking.  In order to get, you need to give. If you keep cutting yourself off from opening up to others, you risk not sharing your skills, talents, and abilities with others in need of help. In helping another person, you cease to focus on yourself. And when you cease to focus on yourself, it is far easier to accept support back from another.   In giving of yourself (your time, your listening ear, your love, your care, etc.), you are helping another learn more about you, be able to care for you, and believe that you will reciprocate the attention that they bestow upon you. Beyond receiving anything in return, giving also promotes cooperation, strengthens bonds, boosts feelings of gratitude, and is just downright good for your health., In order to receive help, you need to trust the other person and to trust that you're worthy of help (self-respect). This might be the hardest part but it is absolutely vital. Wholesome, accepting, self-assured trust is capable of absorbing rejection, attracting genuine help, and will easily detect the occasional exploitative person. Choosing to trust requires that you:   modify your expectations - remember that people are only human and they have both good and bad traits (so do you!)recognize that disappointment, fear, abandonment, and rejection are possible in all relationships find yourself worthy and capable of making wise decisions and being around decent people, A problem is a problem, whatever its ease or difficulty. The litmus test is how much it is impacting you negatively and preventing you from moving forward. Belittling your problem as not worthy of being solved only serves to make it even more challenging to cope with.  If you need help to do that, really don't be afraid to ask for it.	Don't second-guess yourself. Accept that some people do act out of the kindness of their hearts. Be selective about who you ask for help. Understand the natural dynamic of give and take. Learn to trust others. Beware of undermining your problems.It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain. Let go of the problems that no one can fix.There lies the greatest strength of all as there is a big difference between "burying" problems in comparison to accepting, forgiving and letting them go.
Smaller varieties typically adapt to container growing better than standard-length varieties.   Look for "round" varieties that have a spherical shape. Options include Thumbelina, Parmex, and Parisienne. Look for "Nantes" that have a tapered shape, but are shorter and wider than standard varieties. Options include Danvers Half Long, Chantenay Red Core, and Shin Kuroda.; , Find one that is at least one foot (30.48 cm) deep or more. Carrots develop underground and the root system needs a lot of space to grow. The container should also have adequate drainage holes to prevent excess water from causing the carrots to rot.   The type of container does not matter much as long as it has enough depth. You can go with clay, plastic, or stone, and you can opt for a circular pot or a large rectangular planter.  If you have a previously used container, wash it out with warm water and soap before planting your carrots. Bacteria and microscopic insect eggs often hide inside used containers and may hinder your yield if they infect your carrot plants.  Both soil and soilless mixtures can work.   Try a mixture of red soil, decomposed compost, and sand mixed in equal portions for a soil-based media. Consider coco peat, mixed with a small amount of perlite, for a soilless media.	Select your carrot variety. Choose a deep enough container. Clean your container. Opt for a loose, well-draining potting media.
This is a great way to keep your hands busy while your mind focuses on what the teacher or professor is saying. You can also do this at work, when you're thinking about what project you should work on next, or if you're just trying to look busy for the boss.If you're subtle about it you can even have doodling contests with your friend or coworker. Try to out-do one another with fantastic drawings, or add on to one another's drawings, to create something really wild.  You want to challenge yourself at work or in class and if you're getting bored, you probably aren't being challenged enough. Try to come up with a project that would be challenging and interesting and propose it to your boss or teacher., When you have some free time at work or at school, it's a great time to do a little, subtle organizing. Sometimes this can even help you to find your productivity again. Clean-up your work area, or school binder. Make sure that everything is in its proper place and can be easily found.  Clean the screen, clean between the keys. If it used to be white, do your best to carefully restore your computer to its former clean condition.   Organize your computer desktop so you can find things. Put pictures in the labelled picture folders and make sure all your documents are in properly labelled folders.  If you have some time and you're bored, you can make use of it by meditating. This can help calm your mind and get yourself focused for the work ahead of you. It's a great re-energizing tactic.   Sit quietly at your desk and close your eyes (or pretend like you're working). Take deep breaths in and out and pay attention to your breathing. If you feel thoughts come into your head, acknowledge them and let them go.  Reading is fun and you could pick up a book, a magazine, or a newspaper. Reading something helps pass the time by giving you something to keep your brain interested. Some free time is a great time to try something new.   You can usually hide a book beneath some textbook in your class or beneath your desk at work. It makes it look like you're really studying or paying attention to the material, while actually doing something a lot more fun. Read a mystery and try to guess the solution before the detective, or try some fantasy or science fiction. Look into something nonfiction or spiritual, philosophical, paranormal, or even holy topics like Bible, or the Quran. Check out what books you can get from the library and pick them up on your way to or from your work or class. Some libraries even have online databases where you can check out a book without having to leave your house or work!  , Having some free time is a great moment to learn something new and interesting. Then you can impress your friends and family. Learn how to do magic, discover how to breathe fire, or how to make chainmail!  , If you have your computer in front of you, you can use it to go online and surf the internet. Just make sure that you won't be caught by your boss or your teacher. You can use this time to amuse yourself or to learn something new.   Go on something like Craigslist or Ebay and find the weirdest thing you possibly can. Post it to your twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr account. Go on Instagram, Facebook, or Vine. Upload photos, share stories, check out other people's posts and photos.  Watch random YouTube videos. Pick comedy ones if you want a lift, choose viral ones for entertainment and to stay trendy.  Use Pinterest. Choose a topic you like and make a board for it, add pictures you like. Or look at other people's pictures.  Sometimes the best way to amuse yourself when you're bored is to enter into conversation with someone else. Pick someone you don't know that much about and ask them about themselves (where they are from? where they went to school? favorite thing to do outside of work?). You might even make a new friend.	Doodle. Come up with a creative project. Re-organize. Clean your computer. Meditate. Read. Learn something new. Go online. Chat with a coworker.
Obviously you need the instrument in order to learn how to play it. However, if you want to practice you can draw out piano keys on a piece of paper and play that.; , If you’re having trouble remembering what note is which it might help to put little circular stickers on each key. You can write the note of each key inside the sticker. Make sure you don’t damage your keyboard! Don’t write on the keyboards.   Place the stickers on the notes that you are going to play for this song.  You can find the sheet music for chopsticks many places online. You’ll want to be able to refer to the sheet music as you play while you are learning. Once you memorize it you can get rid of the sheet music. You don't have to do this, but it will help you have something to refer to. If you can't read music you can just write down the notes to play on a piece of paper.  You’re not going to be able to play it perfectly immediately, so go into it with that knowledge. It will be a fun experience but you’ll have to practice and work at it. Don’t get frustrated! This is part of the joy of learning.	Find a piano or keyboard that you can use. Place stickers with notes written on them on the keyboard. Print out the sheet music. Commit to learning the song.
Create a slip knot on the hooked end of your crochet hook using one end of the yarn.   Note that the unattached end of the yarn will be left alone for the remainder of the pattern and is referred to as the "tail end." The end still attached to the skein is the "working end," and you will be drawing yarn from that end as you make the hat.; , Make two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.  Work six single crochets into the second chain from the hook. This should form your first round.   Note that the second chain from the hook is also the first chain you created.  To complete the second round, make two single crochets into each stitch of the previous round.   When done, this round should have a total of 12 single crochets. Mark the last stitch of the round with a plastic stitch marker. If you do not have one, use a safety pin or paperclip.  Work one single crochet into the first stitch of the previous round. Work two single crochets into the stitch that follows. Repeat this pattern to complete the remainder of the round, working one single crochet into each odd numbered stitch and two single crochets into each even numbered stitch.   When done, this round should have 18 stitches. Move the pin marker to the last stitch of this round.  Work one single crochet into the first stitch of the previous round. Work another one single crochet into the second stitch. For the third stitch, work two single crochets. Repeat this pattern, making one single crochet, another one single crochet, and two single crochets around the rest of the round.   When done, you should have 24 single crochets in this round. Move the stitch marker to the last stitch in this round before continuing.  Make one single crochet in each of the first three stitches of the previous round. Afterward, make two single crochets into the fourth stitch of the previous round. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of your round.   You should make a total of 30 single crochets for this round. Mark the end of round five with your stitch marker.  For rounds six through nine, you will continue to increase the number of stitches receiving only one single crochet in between the stitches receiving two single crochets.   For round six, work one single crochet into the first four stitches of the previous round, then work two single crochets into the fifth stitch. Repeat until you reach the end of the round. For round seven, work one single crochet into the first five stitches of the previous round, then work two single crochets into the sixth stitch. Repeat until you reach the end of the round. For round eight, work one single crochet into the first six stitches of the previous round, then work two single crochets into the seventh stitch. Repeat until you reach the end of the round. For round nine, work one single crochet into the first seven stitches of the previous round, then work two single crochets into the eighth stitch. Repeat until you reach the end of the round. Note that this round will have 54 stitches in it by the end. Note that you should be marking the end of each round with your stitch marker as you work.  For the remaining rounds, you will only need to make one single crochet in each stitch of the previous round.   Each of the remaining rounds should have 54 stitches. Move the stitch marker to the last stitch of each round before moving onto the next to help you keep track of where you are at in the pattern. This pattern should be followed for rounds 10 through 25.  For the final round, you should make a slip stitch into each of the stitches from the previous round.  Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull it through the loop on your hook and tighten it to form a knot.   Weave in the remaining tail to hide it and complete the baby hat.	Tie the yarn onto the crochet hook. Chain two. Form a ring. Single crochet into each stitch. Single crochet the third round. Increase the size of the next round. Work additional single crochets for the fifth round. Increase the stitch count over the next four rounds. Complete 16 more rounds. Slip stitch across. Tie off the yarn.
Once winter rolls around, adjust your morning routine to allow time to de-ice. Start setting your alarm to go off at least ten minutes earlier than normal. This way you can do a thorough job without feeling rushed (and potentially botching the job!)., There are a couple of household ingredients that you can potentially use as a homemade substitute, but only use those as a last resort. For the best results, go with a product that was specifically designed to do the job without damaging your car in any way. Always stock up on some professionally-made de-icer before winter arrives.De-icer can be found online, at auto parts stores, and the automotive sections at stores like Walmart and Target. Be sure to keep one can of de-icer in your car just in case it ices over somewhere other than home., Give your windshield and other windows a generous spray of your de-icer. Start at the top and then work your way down to the bottom. This way the de-icer will start running down the windows, which means it will cover more ice without you having to waste more product., Definitely use an ice scraper for this, and not some other tool. Again, you want to protect your windows from damage, so use a tool that’s meant for this specific job. Apply plenty of pressure with each stroke, and scrape as far as you can reach in one long, continuous motion. Don’t chip away over one tiny area, because this could scratch the glass underneath. Use the scraper’s brush end (or a separate brush if it doesn’t have one) to clear the loose ice off the window.If the ice is being stubborn, spray it with more de-icer to loosen it up instead of hacking away at it. If your reach is short, choose a scraper with a nice long handle to extend it further., Once you’ve cleared the driver’s side, you may feel the urge to just leave the passenger-side of your windshield and all the other windows as they are if you’re in a rush. Fight that urge and take the time to remove all the ice. Keep in mind that local laws may require you to do this. Even if they don’t, take the time anyway. Don’t limit your field of vision when driving., Now that all the ice has been cleared from the windshield, make sure the wipers haven’t frozen to them. Spray the wipers with de-icer if necessary so you can raise them. Then spray some de-icer into a cloth and rub it over the wipers’ blades. Set the wipers back down into place.When you start the car, turn them on to make sure they function normally., Your windows are the most obvious things that need to be cleared, but keep in mind local laws probably state that others need to be, too. Once the big job is done, scan your car to see if ice or snow is blocking anything else that needs to be uncovered. If needed, de-ice your:Tail and headlights Turn signals License plate(s)	Give yourself time to work. Keep formulated de-icer on hand. Spray windows from the top down. Scrape and brush off the ice. Clear all of the ice from each window. De-ice and test the windshield wipers. Check other areas.
Your home security plan might include upgrades or purchases that you will need to spend money on. Decide how much you can spend on your home's security.; , Any security plan should include keeping intruders from easily entering your home through any doors and windows.   Make sure your doors and windows are kept locked and made from high quality, sturdy instruction. For example, your outside doors should not be hollow or they can be easily broken down.       Install strike plates correctly. This is the metal plate that is attached to your door jamb. It will keep a bolt and lock secure.       Check your door and window hinges. They should be properly installed and secure. If there is a window on your door, make sure it is in good shape and not in need of replacement.  If there are holes or damages to your fence or gate, plan to have them repaired or replaced.   Consider installing a fence or a gate if you do not currently have one. They can help you keep people and animals off your property.  Maybe you rely on a simple deadbolt, or you have an alarm system attached to every door and window.   Price updated security features to see if they are in your budget. Many people increase their home security by installing cameras, panic buttons and sensors on their property.  Or, consider a sign that warns people approaching of dogs and alarms.  All outside areas near your home should be illuminated: http://www.delmarfans.com/educate/outdoor-security-lighting/ . Indoor lighting is necessary too. A few lamps should be left on in the home if you are out.   Set your lights on a timer if you do not want to manually turn them on and off. Or, keep them on all the time.  Your home security plan should contain instructions to all family members on what to do and where to go if something should happen at home.   Decide where you will meet if there is an emergency. This might be a neighbor's house, a relative's home or a public place that is easy to get to.  Do not give out your home security code or leave your key outside in an obvious location.  Whether it is pepper spray, Mace or a stun gun, try to keep it non-lethal for your own protection.  Post it on your refrigerator so it is easy for your family members to see, and include a copy in other areas of your house in case you need to refer to it quickly.   Create a diagram that will highlight the areas that are alarmed as well as where you keep the pepper spray or other defensive tools. Include phone numbers of your local police station as well as friends and relatives. Do not let this plan outside of your house, or your security will be compromised.	Set a budget. Check your doors and windows. Look at any fences or gates you have on your property. Determine what security devices you have, and which you might need. Post signs that advertise your home is monitored 24 hours a day. Make lighting a part of your home security plan. Include an emergency plan. Share information only with people who need to know it. Keep personal protection in your home and accessible. Review and update your security plan regularly.
Riders who enjoy commuting, racing or touring all have different needs that can be accommodated through different recumbent bike designs. In addition, physically-challenged riders should consider their unique requirements before purchasing a recumbent bike.   Limited mobility riders and beginners may want handlebars located below seat level, to put less stress on the back and neck muscles. One-handed controls can be incorporated near the leg area to enable wheelchair-bound riders to steer without handlebars. Physically strong riders seeking a comprehensive workout may enjoy a recumbent bike with arm and leg pedals that enable a full-body workout.; , Where you want to go and how you want to get there determines the best recumbent bicycle styles for your needs. Three popular designs dominate the marketplace.   Long wheelbase (LWB) recumbent bikes are good for low speeds and touring to long-distance locations. Short wheelbase (SWB) bikes feature a compact design good for commuting and city riding. Compact long wheelbase (CLWB) enable beginners to learn rapidly. Their higher seat-heights make riders more visible in traffic and the frame design is more stable than others.  Recumbent bikes comprise a fraction of the bicycle market, which makes them more expensive than standard bicycles. Good quality beginner recumbent bicycles start at about $800 USD.   Recumbent bikes are often custom-made for riders' needs. The more customization, the higher the cost. Riders seeking a lightweight recumbent bike will also pay considerably more than those who purchase a standard upright bicycle of the same weight. A single recumbent bicycle style may not be suitable for riding on different terrain types, such as dirt and asphalt. You may want a second bicycle for activities like mountain biking.  Visit a recumbent bicycle store or manufacturer to experience the different wheel bases, pedal and handlebar locations.   Visit the store during off-peak weekday hours to ensure you can practice riding in the parking lot. Allow ample time to try each model.  Purchasing a pre-owned recumbent will enable you to talk to the owner and ask about their experience using the bicycle.   Call bicycle stores specializing in recumbent bikes to inquire about used models for sale. Checking classified advertisements such as craigslist.org can also help you locate your perfect bike. Only buy a used recumbent bike after trying the model. Ensure that the bicycle is equipped to meet your needs, both physically and while in operation. Ask the owner why the recumbent is being sold.	Assess your riding abilities. Determine your transportation needs. Analyze your budget. Test different models in your budget. Buy a used recumbent bike if your budget is tight.
Cut a piece of acrylic mirror into three 7 7⁄8 inch (20.0 cm) by 1 1⁄8 inch (2.9 cm) rectangles, using an operating table saw with a carbide-tip blade. Use a vacuum to clean any sawdust from the mirrors.  Cut a white PVC pipe with a diameter of 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) to a length of 7 7⁄8 inches (20.0 cm) using a chop saw with a carbide tip-wood blade. Clean the tube to remove any dirt or debris.  Drill a 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) hole into the center of a 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) PVC socket end cap. Wipe around the hole to remove any debris.  Cut a strip of adhesive-backed foam into pieces about one inch long. You will need three pieces for the kaleidoscope.  Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter. Cut it into one inch pieces. You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope.  The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic. Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish.         You can either leave the glass clear to create a "world view" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it the the PVC tube., Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in. Make sure you have removed any protective film first. Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle.  Remove the adhesive backing from the three pieces of foam and stick one piece on the side of each mirror, approximately one inch from the end.  Gently insert the mirrors, foam end first, into the PVC tube. You may need to squeeze the foam to make it fit. Insert the three pieces of foam rope into the spaces between the mirrors and the tube.  Place the PVC end cap over the open end of the PVC tube, twist to secure tightly. Your kaleidoscope is now ready, enjoy the view!	Prepare the mirrors. Prepare the PVC pipe. Prepare the end cap. Prepare the foam strips. Prepare the foam rope. Glue a petri dish to one end of the PVC tube. Assemble the mirrors. Attach the foam strips to the mirrors. Place the mirrors inside the PVC tube. Close it up.
One of the simplest ways to use leftover grounds is to add them to the rest of your compost. In addition to providing extra organic matter, coffee grounds are able to speed up the decomposing process in compost. Getting this benefit is as easy as pouring the leftover grounds into the compost pile and mixing to incorporate them.   There are two main types of composting materials: "green" compost and "brown" compost. Coffee grounds are considered to be "green" compost along with other wet, nutrient rich materials. If you add a lot of coffee grounds to your compost, balance it out by adding some "brown" compost as well — dry, bulky materials like dry leaves, twigs, newspaper, straw, corn husks, sawdust, and so on.; , On their own, coffee grounds have a pH of about 5.1 — fairly acidic compared to the soil in most gardens. Though this can be too acidic for some plants, it's perfect for some that require extra-high acidity. Just sprinkle a handful of grounds near the roots of the plants at the start of the growing season to get the acidifying effect. Blueberries, cranberries, and citrus fruits like coffee added to their soil. Other coffee-loving plants include camellias, gardenias, rhododendrons, and vireyas.Some flowering plants will give different-colored blooms in acidic soil. For example, the addition of coffee grounds to hydrangeas is good for blue blooms.  As noted above, coffee grounds' natural acidity can make them inappropriate for many "average" gardens. To mitigate this, mix a pinch of lime with the grounds. Lime is naturally alkaline (or "basic," the opposite of acidic) and will work against the acidity in the coffee grounds. This lets you add coffee grounds directly to your garden as a mulch or soil conditioner.   Lime (often sold as "garden lime" or "agricultural lime") is a powdery substance that's not related to the green citrus fruit of the same name. You can usually find it at hardware stores or gardening supply stores for fairly cheap.  Acidity isn't the only thing that coffee ground have to offer. They are rich in several nutrients that are critical to healthy plants, so if your garden lacks these, coffee grounds are an excellent choice. See below:Coffee grounds are rich in:  Nitrogen Magnesium Potassium Coffee grounds are not rich in:  Phosphorous Calcium  , You don't need to use the coffee grounds themselves in your garden — you can also make a nutritious plant food from them and use it instead. To do this, place a handful of coffee grounds into a bucket of water. Let it sit in a cool, out-of-the-way place (like your garage) for a day or two. It should create a nice amber-colored liquid. Strain the remaining grounds out, then use the liquid to water your plants.   It will have the same acidity and nutrient content as normal coffee grounds, so use it with caution if your plants don't require high acidity or nitrogen, potassium, etc.	Add coffee grounds to your compost. Add grounds to the soil directly to increase acidity. Consider adding lime to balance coffee's pH. Use coffee grounds to add nutrients to your soil. Optionally, make a liquid plant food.
Pine needle tea has up to five times more vitamin C than a lemon by weight. This tea has a unique minty, sweet taste to it. It is made simply by adding some pine needles to hot water. Do not consume it if you are pregnant or breast feeding.; , They can be used as a pest controller or as fertilizers.  They are great to use as an air freshener inside a simple sachet. Or, they can be used simply as a decoration or even added to potpourri.	Use the pine needles from a pine tree to make tea. When you are sweeping up pine needles, use the pine needles for gardening. Use pine needles as sachet-fresheners.
You drive it, maybe you own it too. In any case, it's vital that you learn as much as possible as you can about this massive piece of machinery that you trust your life with.   Review the owner's manual of any car you own. Owner's manuals will typically provide a maintenance schedule for your vehicle, location of different parts and part numbers, the meaning of different buttons, and many other things you might have had questions about. Learn the specifications for your vehicle, like the stock tire size, recommended tire pressure (not the maximum), and loading information. You should be able to find this information on a label inside the driver's door jamb. Learn the names of different parts on your vehicles. It's most helpful if you have someone knowledgeable who can show you the different parts and what they do, but if not, looking up repair videos for your vehicle can help you with identifying different parts.; ,   Listing any pertinent information will help your mechanic with making a more accurate assessment of the vehicle's problem. You should make note of any abnormal sounds, vibrations, movements, and other tactile feelings. If you notice any lights on the dashboard, report those as well.  Many mechanics would be happy to show you where and what exactly the problem is and entertain questions you may have as long as it is safe for you. Be sure to ask questions like:   How important is this to fix? Can the parts be repaired or will they have to be replaced? Is there a warranty on new parts? How much time would it take to fix this?  , The estimate should include the costs of parts, labor, tests, taxes, and any other services performed. Note that an estimate doesn't mean that the actual price will be exactly the same - but it should be close, unless they get your permission to perform additional services on your vehicle.,, This is for the benefit of you, your mechanic, and any future buyers of your car. This way you can tell when certain maintenance needs to be performed and prevent potential issues before they come up.	Know your car. Use details when describing problems. Ask him to show you the problem. Always ask for a printed or handwritten estimate.Ask questions  , Keep a complete maintenance record for all repairs to your vehicle.
Don't throw him into the shark tank, don't lock him up, don't gloat, don't push him down the shaft of eternal fire. Just shoot him in the head, then shoot him again to make sure.  You can guarantee that somebody will have found a way to escape. If you absolutely must build a dungeon for locking people up, make sure it follows these guidelines:   Don't put in a window. The prisoner can't crawl away out of the window if there is no window. Make sure all of the walls are as thick as possible. This stops prisoners from scratching away the mortar, pulling away the stones and making a hole in the wall. Keep the cell keys in a locked box, out of reach of any stick, belt, shoelace or cunningly trained pet.  This makes it easy for the good guy to disguise himself. At the very least, you need to be able to see the faces of all of your henchmen (I recommend plexiglass visors). Custom-tailored clothes are also helpful, as the poor fit will give the hero away.  The button labeled with the word abort should do something else, like electrocute whoever pushes it. The actual abort button should be labeled with something inane, such as "make coffee" or "recline chair".  That way, if the good guy cuts the power or detonates an EMP, everything keeps working.  The computer should contain useless (e.g. funny cat pictures) or harmful (e.g. a virus) items, so the good guy can't download your evil plans. The plans should be written on flash paper (paper that has been converted to nitrocellulose) that will burn up almost instantly.  Usually this means putting a mixture of men and women on guard at the same time, or hiring eunuchs.  The rank "most trusted henchman" should only ever be awarded posthumously.  Don't hang about, you can always come back if your henchmen defeat him. , This stops the good guy from using the old "count the bullets" trick.  Henchmen will either pass target practise or be used for target practise.	If you catch the good guy, shoot him!, Don't doubt that however secure you think your dungeon is, you're wrong. Don't give your henchmen face-covering helmets and generically-sized clothes. Don't label the abort button with the word abort. Make sure everything has a backup battery and a surge protector. Don't store your evil plans on the computer. Don't hire henchmen that can be distracted by a pretty girl walking past the front of your evil lair. Don't trust anybody. If you have an emergency escape vehicle, use it as soon as the good guy enters your evil lair. Don't make a CCTV system with any blind spots.  , Modify your henchmen's guns so that they fire more bullets than usual. Only hire henchmen with, at the very least, basic marksman skills.
Remove the jug handle by cutting one end of the pin that holds it in. (Use the handles for some other project.) Use a heat gun or hair dryer to soften the labels to remove them.; , Turn the jug upside down and cut out a rectangle, leaving an edge all around.  Cut the holes out on the sides and top only, using a SoniCrafter or whatever you have that will cut through tough plastic.   Cut off the top 2/3, leaving the bottom 1/3 to attach your bottle/cup to.       At this point, score along the bottom, so that the flap can be bent inward.  Use the miter saw to cut off the top of the bottle. (If you are using plastic cups, you can skip this step).  Set the half bottles/cups in the holes of the planter. The top of the "pot" should be just a little above the top of the hole, just so that it doesn't slip inside. Cut off any excess bottle/cup.  Drill a hole a little smaller than the screw through each bottle/cup half bottom, and the flap on each hole. Screw each cup to each flap.  Measure the space between the top of the holes to the bottom of the "pots" and cut a scrap piece of board to fit in and use as a wedge to keep the pots up against the planter. Caulk around the outside edges of each "pot", sides and bottom. Add the caulk to the sides of each "pot" on the inside. After the caulking has dried, you'll probably need to check it over and recaulk any areas that you missed.  Let the caulking cure for the time advised. Once this is done, drill drainage holes in the bottom of the planter.  Sand it just to roughen it up a bit and wipe it down. You are now ready to paint. Paint with a spray paint made for plastic.  Pictured here is the finished "Strawberry Jar".	Prepare the jug. Cut the bottom out. Cut the holes. Cut the "pots". Add the "pots". Screw in the cups. Caulk the "pots". Drill the drainage holes. Paint the strawberry jar planter. Finish and plant.
You should never be bored after school if you have uncompleted homework. If you get your homework out of the way as soon as you get home from school, you will have the rest of the evening to have fun. Even if all of your homework is finished, consider studying for an upcoming test instead of procrastinating until the night before the test.  Of course, if you have a book assigned to you for school, make sure to read it first. However, if you don’t have any required reading for school, try selecting a book that you would like to read for pleasure. Learning to read for pleasure and not just for school will improve your overall quality of life as you grow older.Go to the school or public library and ask the librarian for suggestions. The librarian will help you to select a book that fits your interests. Search the internet for books that seem interesting to you. You can also purchase ebooks to read on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.  If you are craftsy or artistic, try spending your after school time on projects. Create a scrapbook or collage for your memories. Make homemade products, such as body scrub, to give as gifts. Learn to sew or knit to make scarves, hats, or other articles of clothing.  Everyone has skills. Instead of wasting your time after school being bored, you could be spending it perfecting your skills. Practice for the extracurricular activity that you participate in, such as ballet, piano, or baseball. Spend your evenings painting, sewing, or cooking.	Finish all of your homework. Read a book. Create something. Refine your skills.
It's unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over. A bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well, but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars.Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on. You can make a simple bike rack with scrap parts. All you'll need are hooks and a frame. Insert hooks into 2 x 4 boards oriented vertically and attach those boards to a sturdy base, separating each board by the distance between the hubs of the wheels.; , A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master link are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother.   If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases. If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, you can use a special tool called a chain-tool to remove the chain., This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between wheels will be easiest.   If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool., Bike chains are greased to improve their performance and prevent the elements from causing the chain the degrade quickly. It's likely that a layer of gunk has accumulated on your chain. Clean this with a rag that's been dampened with degreaser and wipe free the buildup and grease.   To gain access to the full length of chain, move the pedals with your hands to rotate it through the drivetrain until an uncleaned section of chain is available. If you lack chain degreaser, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) or paint thinner both work well as a substitute. , Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. With a master link, you can do this by squeezing both ends of the master link inwards with your hands or a pair of small pliers so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If using a chain tool, you should:   Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link. Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain. You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged. Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it., Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones.Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.  It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one.   Count the number of links your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove. If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike., For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at either the top or bottom midpoint between your wheels.   Positioning the ends of your chain at the midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible, which will make the reattachment easier., With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link.   You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place. If you were not able to measure and shorten your chain beforehand, you should notice that your chain hangs somewhat loosely in your drivetrain. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear., If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain.   When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much., As your suspension compresses, the chain of your bike will adjust. This can cause chain binding and make your bike difficult to ride. Take your bike off its rack and then:   Vent the compression element from your shock or disengage it. This can usually done with the press of a button on the shocks of your bike. Bike shocks are generally be located on the front frame of your bike around where the frame of your bike forks to the wheel. Press down on the seat of your bike firmly until the suspension is fully engaged. When your bike can compress no further, your suspension is fully engaged. If your chain remains taut, your bike is good to go. If, however, you notice the chain loosens, you'll likely have to remove another link or two. If it resists the compression of your bike's suspension, you may need to add a link., Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers.   To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.  The most reliable way of doing this is with a chain wear indicator, which you should be able to purchase at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading.   Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values. If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn., If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:   Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur. Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly., The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfer the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.   You might want to snap a few pictures of the gear mechanism(s) on your bike with your phone before removing the chain. You can consult these pictures later on, if you're having difficulty reattaching the chain.	Secure your bike. Check for a master link. Position your chain. Clean the chain. Remove the chain. Avoid using failed chains as replacements. Measure your replacement chain. Insert your chain into the gear mechanism. Attach the loose ends of your chain. Remove extra links from the chain, if necessary. Prevent chain binding for full suspension bikes. Test your chain. Evaluate the wear on your chain. Try to join the ends of your chain to test wear, alternatively. Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain.
Brake pads and brake shoes are different from one another. The brake pad is built for disc brakes found on most front axles of cars and trucks. Brake shoes, on the other hand, are built for drum brakes which are often found on the back axles of cars and trucks. The reason behind these two different designs can be found by examining the braking sequence:  When you actuate the brakes of your vehicle, the disc brake pads or brake shoes have to slow down the brake rotors or drums mounted between tire rims and the suspension. The friction of the disc pads squeezing the rotors or pushing the brake shoes outward on the drums in order to slow the vehicle down causes the disk pads or shoes to get really hot.       On long downhill runs, there is a lot more stress placed on the front brakes (and therefore the front brake pads) than on the back brakes. For this reason, a superior braking method is required for the front brakes in order to handle this extra stress.  As mentioned above, the disc brakes located at the front of the vehicle are required to handle more stress than the drum brakes at the rear of the vehicle. As a result, they need to be of a higher quality.  Disc brakes were developed by race car and aircraft designers who wanted to find the best way of slowing down the machine without burning up the brake shoes. They were later introduced to the front axles of commercial vehicles in order to reduce the wear-and-tear on the front brakes.       The rear axle, on the other hand, doesn't have nearly as much force on it during braking, and since brake drums are cheaper and easier to manufacture, these are the more common form of brakes on the rear of most passenger cars and trucks.       However, more modern performance cars and heavy duty trucks usually have disc brakes on both axles (front and rear) because of their superior braking capacity. Disc brakes handle heat a bit better than drum brakes too, which means they still work well when they’re hot. Any braking system can develop fading from heat or water but disc brakes recover from those two issues quicker than drum brakes.	Learn the difference between brake pads and brake shoes. Understand why disc brakes are superior to drum brakes.
By definition, a collage should be made up of several different pieces. Those pieces can be made of all sorts of items, such as paper, yarn, fabric, stamps, magazine cut-outs, plastic, raffia, foil, labels, lids, matchsticks, corks, natural items (bark, leaves, seeds, eggshells, seashells, twigs, etc.), buttons, and so forth. You can either choose one medium such as paper or fabric, or you can make an eclectic mix, such as paper, buttons and foil., While a paper or cardboard backing is the usual choice, the backing can be anything you consider will work well. For example, a backing could be blotting paper, cardstock, fabric such as a piece of hessian (burlap), newspaper, old book covers, wood, smooth bark, plastic, etc. If the surface is usable and items can be stuck to it, you can probably use it for making a collage., As you become more proficient at and enthused about making collages, you'll probably start seeing opportunities in all sorts of materials. Be sure to keep a special collage materials box for collecting the pieces in.	Choose a style of collage. Choose a suitable backing. Hoard the materials for future collages.
Bottles, although glass, are often surprisingly tough and can last many years. Many very old bottles have been found intact along the edges of rivers.; , A length of river edge that is sandy/rocky has high potential, as the same geological processes that created that kind of river edge also tend toward depositing such things as bottles. For time's sake, you should consider how far you should go before turning back and stick to that plan. On the way back you can concentrate your search closer or further from the water. Give yourself plenty of daylight time and try not to get caught out at dusk. River edges can be dangerous places in the dark.  Bottle glass tends to stand out when you come across it, especially the valued bright colour ones.  Try not to pull too hard, as it may be fragile or broken. If necessary, gently dig around the bottle with your fingers or a stick.  Wash the dirty bottle in the river and put it in a soft bag, a big pocket or what-have-you. When you get home you can clean the bottle better with a mild detergent (like dish soap). Avoid harsh cleaners, and never put them in a dishwasher if you want to retain their collectible value.	Find a section of river edge that is near a populated area, preferably one that has been inhabited for some number of years. Decide on a stretch in which to search. Begin slowly walking in a straight line along the edge of the water, scanning back and forth in front of you as you go. When you find glass carefully, pull it out of the sand (if it is covered) with one or two fingers. More often than not, the bottle will be without a cap and full of dirt.
It will be much easier to build a brain atlas if you first reference a picture of one. Doing so will make it easier to gauge where each piece fits in and how that piece should be shaped., Each color will be used to create a different section of the brain. Using different colors will make it easier for you to separate and identify each part of the brain.  Use a different color of clay for each section of the brain. No particular color is assigned to a specific section of the brain in the atlas. Uses whichever color meets your preference.  Pinch of a small amount of clay and roll it between your palms to create a thick rope. This section will have a slight “s” shape or elbow. Smooth the rope with your fingers until the top of it curves upward and to the left, while the bottom should be slightly longer than the top section and sink off to the right. The bottom should also have a pointed tip, while the top should have a flat edge and look a bit wider overall.  Pinch off roughly half the amount you used with creating the brain stem. Roll and form this into a triangle with rounded edges. Position it so that one side of the triangle sits in the upper curve of the brain stem., Pinch off a roughly the same size lump of clay you used for the brain stem. Roll this clay into an oval shape. Place the center of this oval onto the top of the brain stem, and press it gently to attach the two pieces of clay together. The bottom, left half of the oval should reach half way up the left side of the cerebellum if we consider the bottom of the triangle to be the part matched to the brain stem., Take a piece of clay roughly the same size as your temporal lobe. Roll and flatten this piece into a quadrilateral which splays out at the top making a muffin shape. Position it so that the bottom center of the lobe connects to the top, left 1/4 of the temporal lobe. The right side right side of the occipital lobe should cover the other left half of the cerebellum, with the muffin top spilling slightly over the top of the cerebellum., Pinch off slightly more clay than the amount used to create your occipital lobe. Form another rectangle just larger than a square. One bottom shorter edge of the rectangle should cover the rest of the right half of the oval made by the temporal lobe. The rectangle should lean slightly to the right., This should be your largest bit of clay, and slightly larger than your original amount used to create the brain stem. Roll it into an oval, then slightly flatten the bottom right and left sides to attach them to the rest of your brain atlas. Wedge this final piece in place on the left of your model to create the front of the brain. The flattened bottom right section will attach to the parietal lobe, while the bottom left covers the top left half of the temporal lobe oval, slightly overlapping the edge.	Consult a basic brain atlas. Choose six different colors of clay. Form the brain stem. Attach the cerebellum. Create the temporal lobe. Move on to the occipital lobe. Add the parietal lobe. Make the frontal lobe to complete the atlas.
Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade.  Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade.  Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade.   Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over.  Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes.  Sand the blade using successively finer grits of sandpaper, up to 220 grit. Be sure to take the time to sand out any scratches. Sand all areas of the blade. This will increase its luster and quality.   Sand in opposite directions each time you change grits. You can use a file to add ridges to the inside near the handle. Trace a pattern and file the metal away.	Use the hacksaw to cut the metal. Grind the profile. Grind the edge. Drill your rivet holes. Finish the blade.
To calculate your lease balance, you will first need to calculate your lease value and monthly payments. To do, you will need some information. Contact your lender or dealer and ask for the following:   The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for the vehicle. The sale price of your vehicle. Any rebates or incentives provided on your lease. The residual value of the vehicle. The lease duration and the number of months remaining. The money factor on your lease. This figure is similar to an interest rate, but is expressed differently.; , Read the agreement to protect yourself against calculations errors on the funder's part or purposeful fraud. Compare each figure stated in your agreement to the information you just received from your dealer or lender. Look for early termination fees, administrative charges, and taxes, along with any resale charges or expenses. Your agreement will also specify a residual value for the vehicle, so make sure that this matches the value given to you by the lender or dealer.   An early termination charge may be assessed by the dealer in the event of lease termination. This charge may be in the form of several months' worth of lease payments and may depend on how many months of payments remain on the lease., Any unpaid or late lease payments will also be added into the cost of ending your lease. Check for these payments by checking over your lease payment history., Your monthly lease payment is the payment you have been paying throughout the life of your lease. You can find this amount on your lease bills. If you have not yet gotten the lease. You can calculate your monthly lease payment by adding the vehicle's monthly depreciation plus the monthly finance charge.   Calculate the monthly depreciation by subtracting the residual value from the capitalized cost of the vehicle. The capitalized cost of the vehicle is what the lender borrowed for the lease, which is the sale price of the vehicle minus incentives and rebates.  For example, a $40,000 car might have sold for $37,000, and then been further reduced by a $2,000 rebate to $35,000. The capitalized cost is the $35,000.   The residual value is stated in your lease agreement. Imagine for the $35,000 vehicle that the stated residual value is $20,000. The total depreciation over the life of the lease would be $35,000 (the capitalized cot) - $20,000 (residual value), or $15,000. The monthly depreciation, assuming a 5-year lease, would then be $15,000/60 (for 60 months), or $250. The finance charge is calculated by adding together the capitalized cost and depreciation charge and then dividing by the money factor. For example, imagine that the lease described above has a money factor of 0.00100. The monthly finance charge would then be ($35,000+$20,000)*0.00100, which is $55. Finally, add the monthly finance charge to your monthly depreciation to get the monthly payment. In this case, this would be $55 + $250, or $305., You can work out the number of months left on your lease in several ways. First, try just asking your lender or dealer how many months of payments remain on the lease. Alternately, you can subtract the number of months you have paid from the total lease duration in months. So, if you've paid 3 years (36 months) of a 5-year (60 month) lease, you have 60-36, or 24 months remaining., Once you know how many payments you still owe, multiply that number by your monthly payment amount to get your adjusted lease balance. For example, using the example of 24 months remaining on the five-year lease with a $305 monthly payment, you would have a lease balance of 24*$305, or $7,320., Despite the simple calculation above, your actual adjusted lease balance may be different due to rent charges in your lease. These may differ from your calculations due to different calculations made as part of the actuarial method by the lender or dealer. To know your adjusted lease balance for sure, call your lender or dealer and ask for this balance., The residual value is defined in the lease agreement. It is the lender or dealer's estimated value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term. This may be somewhat higher or lower than the actual value of the vehicle in the current market when you end your lease, but is still used in determining your termination costs., The realized value is another way to measure the value of the vehicle at the time of your lease's termination. It can be defined in the lease agreement, or may be calculated through other means, including:   You or the dealer may obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of the vehicle upon lease termination. The highest bid for the vehicle at a wholesale or retail auction.The insurance payout for a total loss in the event that the vehicle is severely damaged in a collision., Add up termination fees, charges, taxes, unpaid amounts, and resale expenses to arrive at a fee total for the lease termination. Then, add in your lease balance as calculated by you or provided by your lender. Next, add this figure to the residual value specified in your loan agreement. This number represents the money that you owe your lender before turning over the vehicle.For example, imagine you owe $2,000 in various fees and expenses, along with the loan balance of $7,320 calculated in the previous example and a residual value of $20,000. Your total at this stage would be $2,000 + $7,320 + $20,000, or $29,320.  Your realized value is now subtracted from the previous total to arrive at your early termination cost. Keep in mind that your realized value may be lower or higher than the residual value in the lease agreement and depends on the market value of the vehicle.For example, imagine that the realized value for the car in the previous example is $28,000 at the time of lease termination.  Your early termination cost will be what you owe the lender or dealer for ending your lease early. In the above example, this would come to $29,320 - $28,000, or $1,320.   This fee can be avoided by transferring the lease to someone else rather than terminating it.	Request information from your dealer or lease provider. Double-check the criteria for early termination that is included in your lease agreement. Check for past-due payments. Find your monthly lease payment. Figure out how many months are left on the lease. Multiply the number of months by the monthly payment. Confirm your lease balance with your lender. Check your lease agreement for the vehicle's residual value. Figure out the vehicle's realized value. Add together expenses, fees, and your lease balance. Subtract realized value. Arrive at an early termination cost.
Transportation means will be one of your major concerns in case of an EMP; you won't want to be left stranded and forced to walk on foot.; , Preferably dehydrated food, since it's lighter, but canned or jarred food will do. Don't buy a 5-liter bottle, instead, buy several half-liter small bottles, they are easier to arrange, end you can have some with drinkable water and others with water to purify later. Just make sure you can tell them apart.  This "72 Hour Survival Kit" will serve greatly when you need to Bug Out (flee), and can provide you with the essentials for a longer stay in the wilderness. Make sure you can run with it.  Just make sure there is a good mix of essential skills. Remember, hacking a computer will serve no purpose after an EMP.  Weapons such as firearms are great but if they are illegal in your area. Go for pepper spray, knives, mace spray or even rocks and sticks! But make sure you know how to use our weapons and also get training if your weapons are not available.	Buy a bike and learn to ride it. Buy non-perishable food and bottled water. Make a BOB (Bug Out Bag). Assemble a survival group. Consider self-defence weapons and training.
In this case you'll need them wide and fat, so extend them on either side and add the toes at the front. ,, Cut out pieces of polyfoam and glue them to fill in the sides of the slippers where the canvas extends beyond the slipper., Glue it in place., You can use scissors for doing this, or you can buy a tool for cutting foam.        If, as you're cutting and shaping the toes, you accidentally cut off too much and make them look blocky, fill in the gaps with batting.  Experiment with something cheap that you don't mind throwing away until you get a shape that will fit around your foot. Use the image as a guide for the desired shape. If the fabric is only 2 way stretch, make sure you cut it so it stretches horizontally., When you cut it out and fold it in half it should be similar to this. Sew the edges together, forming a tube of sorts. You will also need to sew elastic casing on the narrow end so that it doesn't slip down when you're wearing it. Put it on your foot while you're wearing the slipper., Pin it to the sock you made in the previous step. This image shows a white fabric being pinned for demonstration purposes, but yours should be the same color as your sock., Sew on the sole and flip back right side out.  You can add a bias tape elastic casing to the top, necessary to keep it from slipping down. , Otherwise it will slide around., Use embroidery thread to pinch the fabric in place and tie it underneath.,, Just cut them out of felt and glue them on., It will keep your fabric from getting dirty and provide a grip so you don't slide around on floors. It's recommended that you use the thickest craft foam you can find.,,	Draw what you want the sole of your foot to look like on the plastic canvas.  Repeat for the other slipper and cut both out. ,  Glue to the sole of the slipper. ,   Fill the shape with poly foam.   Add another layer to round out the top.   Carve it into a round shape.  Cut out the fabric.  Sew the edges together as shown.  Cut another piece of fabric to serve as the "sole" of your feet.  Remove the sock carefully and flip it inside out.  Pull it back over the slipper. ,  Take the embroidery thread (in the same color as your fabric) and a big needle, and, using several stitches, tack down the fabric to the plastic canvas.  Define the toes.  Define them even more by gluing a thin stripe of felt between the toes. ,  Add any other detailing, like spots, stripes, bows; whatever your character requires.  Take the black foam and cut out a sole for the bottom of the foot.   Glue it to the bottom and make sure it doesn't stick out from the sides. ,  Enjoy your self-made cat feet!
You will need this to record vocals.; , This could be GarageBand, Logic, Cubase, ProTools or even Audacity!  , Guitars? Bass? Drums? Make sure you have the necessary equipment to record these. For guitars and basses with your amp and one or two cables, it's okay. For drums you might need specific mics that are quite expensive.  Take off the end of the cable that is connected to the amp.   You might need a little adapter to convert from a 6.35mm end to 3.5mm (standard headphone jack measure), then plug it to your computer's Audio-In port. (Usually next to the Audio-Out, or where you plug headphones or in newer Mac models, it's the same for Audio In & Out)  , Make proper adjustments for the DAW to recognize your guitar plugged and for the program to record from that line (either Mono or Stereo).  You can also mic your amp, by putting the mic close to the amp and set the program to receive that signal.  For the drums you can use Drum Machines included on some DAWs, like GarageBand or Acoustica Mixcraft.  Keyboards often have a MIDI-out or a USB port so you can record directly, if not, use the headphone jack on it and plug it like you plugged the guitar/bass/microphone.  Other instruments like violins or pianos need a microphone in order to be recorded.  Your voice can be recorded either using a common microphone plugging it the way you plugged your guitar; or you can use any USB microphone. Guitar Hero or Rock Band mics work perfectly, people have recorded a whole EP with them, so don't be afraid to try them!  , Phone recorders are increasingly high-quality, and can be just as easy for getting quick ideas down on record so you can play them back as in setting up an elaborate DIY studio with your computer. All you've got to do is click a button and place the phone close to the source.   Try downloading higher-quality audio recorders than the default one that comes on the phone. HD options are available for no more than a few dollars--much cheaper than ProTools or other pro software.  Digital recorders like Zoom mics are great for recording acoustic music in quiet settings, just as good at getting field recordings and capturing the ambience of the room. You can record it straight into the recorder, play it back, and upload it to your computer as an mp3 to listen to later and share with your friends.  If it was good enough for the Mountain Goats, who recorded their first several albums all on a boombox and developed a huge following, it can be good enough for getting quick ideas down for demos or for recording practice sessions.   If you've got an old model analog cassette stereo, pop a fresh cassette tape in, hit record, and play acoustic interments close to the input. For better quality, consider lining in a straight AV cable mic with the appropriate jack.  On YouTube, there are many different backing tracks you can find for writing your own song to.  Once you have it in your head what sort of melody you could sing, the whole process will be easy.  Use interesting words and gripping sentences for this. Use stuff that will hook the listener.  Then, upload it into a sound editor in a software like Easy Media Creator 10 by Roxio. You then have that as your first layer.  Then upload the instrumental onto your phone. This will help to keep your music organised. Put your ear buds in, then press record on the sound app and play on the song. You will be able to sing in time.  Then add a second layer in your Sound Editor, and put it on. , Rip the track to CD, and it's all done.	Obtain a home recording studio setup, you can use reflection filter products such as SnapRecorder. Secondly make sure your computer has enough RAM memory to run a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Organize what you want to record. Plug your guitar to your amp as you would normally. Hit record. Use the mic and amp. Record the drums. Record keyboards. Record other instruments. Record your voice. Record on your phone. Consider investing in a high-quality hand-held digital recorder. Get an old cassette tape boombox for recording acoustic music. Decide what backing track you're going to use. Find a melody that will fit to the instrumental. Write the lyrics. Save the instrumental using an app like TubeSave. Using a tablet (iPad, Kindle Fire HD), download a really good sound recorder. Upon finishing, upload the recording onto your computer. Increase/decrease the volume of your vocals to the volume you want on the song.  , Save the finished song.
Despite what you may think based on the looks of some punks, the movement isn't about fashion, so ladies, don't spend hours looking for the "perfect outfit" or putting on makeup, and guys, don't wear your "favorite shirt" or anything you don't mind getting beer and sweat on - and both of you, be prepared to have a shirt get ripped. These shows get very hot and sweaty after a while, and most of them stretch on in excess of three hours (most cities have a midnight - 2:00AM curfew though), so wear something that can breathe and not get ripped off easily. T-shirts, jeans/shorts, and good athletic shoes or boots are preferred. Tank tops, sandals, and skirts or baggy pants are not.; , Whether you're talking to a bouncer, a band member, or another person in the audience, be polite and respectful. Strike up a conversation with someone between bands; who knows, you might find out about another cool band or even make a friend!  , If one begins to form, get out if you have no idea how to maneuver your way around in one. If you feel brave, however, know that it's mainly shoving and slamming into other people (slam-dancing) or running in a circle. Depending on the genre, some people (known as "hardcore dancers") will swing their arms and kick to the rhythm of the music. In all of these cases, nobody is intentionally hurt, and if you fall or want to get out, people will help you out. If you wish to leave, make your intentions known to the people at the "wall" of the pit by making a T shape with your hands to express your wish for "time out", otherwise, you may be mistaken for a slam-dancer trying to approach the wall and will be shoved back as a result. Do not take offense if this happens; just try to leave elsewhere.  If you get hurt, it's nobody's fault but your own, since nobody forced you to do it. That being said, if you wish to crowd-surf, make sure that the people around you are cool with it, make sure your wallet, keys, and phone are someplace safe (to prevent them from being stolen) and keep your feet above people's heads. If you're a girl, you may get groped by a jerk in the audience; the people around them will usually retaliate for you, so don't go blindly kicking into where the person was. If you get dropped, try to protect your head and your back; your body can take an impact, but your brain and spine won't do that very easily. As for stage diving, don't stay onstage for more than three seconds, definitely do not touch the band members, and make sure that the audience will catch you. The bigger (height and weight wise) you are, the less likely they are to catch you. Other than that, just stick to the basics above.  If you begin to feel dizzy or faint, get out of the crowd, get some water, and get into some fresh air. If you do pass out or even begin to get weak, you could lose footing and be crushed under the rest of the crowd. This has happened before (most infamously at a concert by The Who in Cincinnati and at a Smashing Pumpkins gig in the 90's), and you don't want it to happen to you.  If water isn't free (it usually is at punk shows), conserve it as much as possible. If it's free, drink at least two glasses between bands or when you get tired, and maybe pour a little over your head to cool off if you feel hot enough.  Retaliation will get you thrown out at best or assaulted at worst, so let the big guys do their job.  Jump around like a maniac, scream until your voice goes out, go to school/work the next day with bruises and five hours of sleep, and have some good memories for the future.	Wear practical clothing and footwear. Be cool. Moshing originated in the punk movement, and it definitely still goes on to this day. Crowd surfing and stage diving are dangerous, however some people choose to do this anyway. If you can't breathe, GET OUT. Stay hydrated. Guys AND girls: If someone's harassing you (verbally, physically, or sexually), tell the bouncers. Have fun.
Lay out a sheet of green tissue paper. Pick up one corner and roll it into a tight cylinder. Continue rolling, pressing down the paper to keep it as tight as possible. Now you have the stem for your flower.   ; , Wrap a small piece of tape around the final corner of the paper "stem."     , This looks best with paper in two or three bright colors. Cut the paper to 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 in) for a medium–large flower, or try out other sizes.  Starting from a short side, fold the stack of paper over about 2.5 cm (1 inch). Crease the paper, flip the stack over, and fold it again in the other direction. Keep folding in alternate directions, as though you were making a paper fan. Continue until the entire stack forms an accordion fold.      Optionally, trim the ends into a point, rounded end, or V-shaped notch. These effects create a flower with distinct petals, instead of a fluffy carnation. You can even make a second layer in green paper, cutting it into sharp points to form leaves. If you are using paper much smaller or larger than the size mentioned above, adjust the size of the fold to match.  Keep the paper in a 1-inch wide stack. Fold it in half so the two ends meet. Crease it to mark the center, then unfold it again.  Place the stem against the crease mark. Fold it over the paper so it touches itself on the other side. Secure the stem with tape.      Tie a ribbon or wire around this instead if you want to hang the flower. Cut two small notched at the center first to secure it., Gently separate the layers of tissue paper. Spread them out on all sides to form a round flower.	Roll green paper into a stem. Tape the stem. Stack four sheets of tissue paper or crepe paper. Fold the stack accordion-style. Crease the center of the paper. Tape the stem around the center. Fan out the accordion folds.
This is not true by any means. Playing bass takes a lot of rhythm and coordination. If you do not have either, practice up on them before taking action for the next step.; , This is a fairly easy one, assuming financial limitations are few. Buy a bass under $500, but more than $200, since these are generally very good quality instruments, but not too fancy or elaborate. As far as amps go, get one about 50w for starting. 50 watts is enough to feel the bass and hear it over a drummer, considering you are playing with one. Upgrade both your bass and amplifier after about a year of heavy use.  This step is the most important of them all. If you don't know how to play, and play well, you never can have the chance for people to like you and your style! So you can either do what i did, teach yourself for about a year and then start lessons, or just take lessons right off the bat. Do not teach yourself without taking lessons at all along the way, only because i feel that associating with one who knows more about the instrument than you can truly help you succeed.  What good is a bass player without a band backing him or her up? join up with some people who share interests in the same kind of music as you, and learn to cover some of your favorite songs. This will help you in the future if you start writing original material. Make sure your new band practices often.  Don't just rip off some other Bass player's style. First thing in establishing your style is to find out your method of playing your bass guitar. Do you play with your finger, with a pick, or do you slap? Make sure you have your style down-pat and then move on to deciding your image. What matters is the player and how well they perform. If you wish to establish your look, by all means, do it! Are you going to take the Flea approach? The "Krist N style"? Les Claypool-esque? Do whatever feels and looks the most natural for you. Don't try to be something you're not either, you don't want to be a poser.  Book some gigs and rock your heart out! Figure out your stage presence and always be in this presence at shows! get people excited! land a record deal! BE BIG! just remember, stay true to the music. it's the best thing to ever happen to you, take my word for it.	Make sure you are serious about becoming a bass player, most people think that it is very easy and doesn't take any skill. Purchase a bass guitar and a bass amplifier. Learn how to play!, Join/start a band!, This is it, time to establish your style. Succeed!
This step isn't necessary, but it can make your project easier if you have a model for your costume. Find a photo of the front and back of the Jellicle you're using as inspiration. You don’t have to make your costume an exact replica, but you can use it for guidance.   If you don’t want to copy an existing Jellicle, study photos of all the Jellicles to get an idea of the accessories, fur, and patterns that they use so you can create your own.; , The major element of a Jellicle cat costume is the full unitard. You need to find one that covers the legs, body, torso, and arms.   If you're making a costume for a specific Jellicle, try to find a leotard that matches the fur color. Otherwise, your best bet is to go with a white unitard.Good places to find a unitard include costume shops, dancer and gymnastic supply stores, American Apparel, and online.  There are a number of supplies you'll need to make and decorate your costume and the accessories that go with it, including:   Fabric paint in multiple colors A disappearing fabric marker A pair of furry, knee-high leg warmers A pair gloves or arm bands A yard of faux fur material to match your cat suit A ball of yarn in the color you want your tail to be Small, medium, and large paint brushes Ballet slippers A white spiky-hair wig A clean spray bottle Acrylic ink Isopropyl alcohol 70 percent  , Put on your unitard in front of a full-length mirror. Using your photo or your imagination to guide you, use the disappearing marker to indicate where you want different patterns stripes, spots, and coloration markings on the unitard.   If it’s hot where you're working, consider running a fan gently while you do this, so that you don’t get sweaty and make the marker run. When you're finished, you might want to have a shower to wash the marker off your body in case it bled through., To turn your white unitard into a cat suit, you have to paint it with cat-like stripes and spots. On a hard, flat surface, lay out some newspapers or a canvas drop sheet to protect your work surface. Place a layer of plastic or newspaper inside the unitard to separate the front and back and prevent the paint from bleeding.Use the marks you made with the disappearing marker to guide you regarding patterning and colors. Be sure to use a thin layer of paint, otherwise the paint will be thick and bulge off the fabric. Use the small paint brush to paint crosshatches to create patches. Use the small paint brush to create tight vertical lines to create diagonal stripes To make your job easier and avoid having to constantly wash your brushes, paint one color at a time before moving on to the next color. When you have finished creating all the designs, use your large brush to paint the unitard in the color of the cat’s body.  Once you’ve finished painting the front of the cat suit, let it dry overnight. Otherwise, you may smear and smudge the paint and ruin all the hard work you’ve put into the suit.   The next day, you can flip the unitard over and paint the back. Use the same methods and techniques that you used for the front. When finished, allow the paint to dry overnight again.  The paint may be somewhat crunchy or hard, but it will soften up over time as you wash the suit. Wash the suit by hand with a mild hand soap to remove excess paint and marker.   When clean, lay the suit on a large towel and blot it dry with a second towel. Hang it to dry.  For this you'll need to find a blonde wig with long spiky hair (sometimes called punker wigs). You'll also need acrylic ink (2-ounce bottles) in all the colors you want the hair to be, 70 percent rubbing alcohol, and enough clean spray bottles for each color ink you're using.Use elastic bands to section the wig and divide the hair into patches that will be different colors. Pick one color to start with, such as red, for instance. Leave out all the sections you want to dye red and cover the other sections with plastic wrap to protect them. Take the wig outside and lay down a large plastic bag to protect the ground. With your first color, pour the ink into a spray bottle, then add equal amounts of isopropyl alcohol. Shake well. Spray the ink onto all the sections of hair that you want to dye red. With gloved hands, work the ink into every strand. When you’ve done all those sections, cover them with plastic wrap and let the ink sit for about 10 minutes. Then, remove the plastic and let the hair dry for about an hour. Rinse under warm water until the water runs clean. Repeat with the remaining hair, working with one color at a time.  There are several things that you can use to create the furry or patterned arm bands worn by the Jellicles. Good options include:   Faux-fur trimmed, elbow length gloves. Cut the finger tips off so the top two-thirds of your fingers are exposed. Furry arm bands Animal-print pantyhose: cut the legs off so you have one band for each arm. Snip off the feet so you can slip them onto your arms, and trim them so they are forearm- or elbow-length  , The Jellicles also wear furry spats on the bottom of their legs, and you can replicate this with furry leg warmers.You can find these at costume shops, dance supply stores, accessory stores, or online.  To make the tail, take a ball of yarn in the color you want your tail to be. Cut about 12 pieces of yarn that are each 63 inches (160 cm) long. This will yield a 25-inch tail, roughly. Lay them all out so they match up. Grab all the yarn ends on one side and tie them all into a loop. To make the tail:Divide the yarn pieces into three even groups and braid them together, leaving the final four inches free. Tie a knot in the end to secure the braid. If you like, decorate the tail by gluing extra pieces of yarn or strips of faux fur onto the tail. To tie the braid to your body, measure the circumference of your waist. Double that number, then multiply that by 2.5.Cut another 12 pieces of yarn to that length. Tie a knot in one end and braid that yarn like you did before. Slip the loop of the tail through this new braid and position it in the center of the longer braid. Position the tail at the bottom center of your back. Wrap the longer braid around your body twice and tie it in place at the back.	Choose a Jellicle to model your costume after. Find a full-body leotard. Gather your supplies. Get into the unitard and mark patterns. Paint the front of the unitard. Let the front dry before painting the back. Hand wash the unitard. Wig. Find the right arm covers. Turn leg warmers into furry spats. Make the tail.
There are several varieties of hydroponic systems, and tomatoes can grow well in any of them. The instructions in this section will teach you how to construct an ebb and flow system, which is relatively cheap and easy to build. This system is also known as a flood and drain system because it floods the plants with nutrient solution and then the solution drains when it is about two inches from the top of the container.Alternatives:Deep water culture: simple system for cherry tomatoes and other small plants.Multi flow: a larger version of the ebb and flow that relies on gravity. Difficult to build, but supports more plants.Nutrient film technique (NFT): Suspends the plants with roots brushing against slope of trickling nutrients. Slightly more finicky and expensive, but preferred by some commercial growers.   Note: Hydroponics stores and home improvement stores may sell a hydroponics kit which includes everything you need to set up your system. Alternatively, you can purchase each component separately, or even find some of them around your house. Clean secondhand or previously used components thoroughly before building the hydroponics system.; , Hydroponics systems are only suitable for indoor or greenhouse environments. They require precise control to function properly, so they should be set up somewhere closed off from other rooms and from the outside. This allows you to set the temperature and humidity to accurate levels needed for best growth.   It is possible to grow hydroponics using natural light, but keep the system under a glass or polyethylene covering such as a greenhouse roof, not open to the air.  Use a plastic container that does not let in any light to prevent the growth of algae. The larger this reservoir, the more stable and successful your hydroponics system will be. Each tomato plant requires about 2.5 gallons of nutrient solution.However, many factors can cause the tomato plants to use water faster, so it is recommended that you use a container that can hold double the minimum amount of water.You may use a plastic bucket or trash can for this purpose. Use a brand-new one to prevent any contamination of the system, or at least a lightly-used one thoroughly scrubbed with soapy water and rinsed. Collected rainwater may be better suited for hydroponics than tap water, especially if your tap water is especially "hard" with high mineral content., This "ebb and flow tray" will support your tomato plants, and will be periodically flooded with nutrients and water that the tomato roots will absorb. It must be sturdy enough to hold up your plants (or be placed atop additional support), and placed higher than your reservoir to allow excess water to drain down into it. These are typically built of plastics, not metal, to avoid corrosion that could affect the plants and wear out the tray.  You can purchase a water pump at a hydroponics store, or use a fountain pump found at home improvement stores. Many pumps will have a chart listing the water flow at different heights. You may use this to find a pump strong enough to send water from the reservoir to the tray containing the plants. The best course of action, however, may be to pick a powerful, adjustable pump and experiment with the settings once you have your system set up.  Using 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) PVC tubing, or the type of tubing that came in your hydroponics kit, attach one length of tubing between the water pump and the tray, so the tray can be flooded to the height of the tomato plant roots.   Position the inlet and outlet pipes at opposite ends of the tray to promote water circulation.  Attach a second length of PVC tubing to the tray with an overflow fitting, located at a height at the bottom of the roots.When the water reaches this level, it will drain back through this tube and into the reservoir.   Keep in mind that the overflow tube should be larger in diameter than the inlet tube from the pump to avoid flooding., A simple timer intended for light fixtures can be used to power the water pump at regular intervals. This needs to be adjustable so you can increase or decrease the amount of nutrients delivered depending on the plants' stage of life.   A heavy duty 15-amp timer with waterproof cover is recommended.Any water pump should have a way to attach a timer, if it doesn't come with one already, but the exact instructions vary by model. Ask the manufacturer if you are having trouble with this step.  Turn on the water pump and see where the water goes. If a stream of water fails to reach the tray, or if excess water spills over the edges of the tray, you may need to adjust the settings of your water pump or you may need to adjust the size of your drain pipe. Once you have the water set to the correct strength, check the timer to see if it sets the pump going at the specified times.  Raise your tomato plants from seed whenever possible. If you bring plants in from the outdoors, you may introduce pests and diseases to your hydroponics system. Plant seeds in a nursery tray with a special growing material for hydroponics, instead of ordinary soil. Before using, soak the material with pH 4.5 water, aided by a pH test kit from a garden store. Plant the seed under the surface, and keep under plastic domes or other transparent material to trap moisture and encourage the seeds to sprout.   Growing materials:Rock Wool: excellent for the tomatoes, but wear a mask and gloves to avoid irritation.Coconut coir: excellent choice, especially when mixed with clay "grow rocks." Low-quality products may require rinsing due to salt content.Perlite: cheap and moderately effective, but washes away in an ebb and flow system. Best in a mix with 25% vermiculite.  As soon as the plants sprout, remove the covering and place the seedlings under a light source for at least 12 hours a day.Only use incandescent light bulbs as a last resort, as these produce more heat than other options.   See the section on hydroponics system setup to learn about grow light options. Take care not to let the light shine on the roots to avoid damaging them. If roots are protruding from the starter material before they are ready to transplant, you may need to soak additional starter material and use it to cover them.  Wait until their roots start to protrude from the bottom of the nursery tray, and the first "true leaf" has grown, larger and different in appearance than the first one or two "seed leaves". This usually takes 10–14 days.When you move them into the hydroponics system, you may place them at 10 to 12 inch intervals in a layer of the same material, or transfer them to individual plastic "net pots" containing the same material.   If using the ebb and flow system described in this article, the plants are placed on the tray. Other systems may call for the plants to be placed in a trough, along a slope, or wherever the water and nutrients can reach the roots.  To begin with, try setting the pump to run for 30 minutes every 2.5 hours. Do not go more than 2.5 hours without running the pump.Keep an eye on the plants: you'll need to increase the watering frequency if they begin to wilt, and decrease it if the roots become slimy or soaked. Ideally, the material the plants are in should just barely dry out when the next watering cycle comes along.   Even once the watering cycle is established, you may need to increase the watering frequency once the plants begin to bloom and fruit, since these processes require additional water.  For ideal growing conditions, expose growing tomato plants to between 16 to 18 hours of light a day. Then turn off the lights and let them sit in total darkness for about 8 hours. The plants will still grow if you are relying on sunlight, but will likely grow more slowly.  Some tomato plants are "determinate," meaning they grow to a specific size, then stop. Others continue to grow indefinitely, and may need gently tying to a stake in order to grow upright. Prune them by breaking off stems with your hands rather than cutting them off.   Keep in mind that even though determinate tomatoes will grow without staking, there is a risk of lower yields if you do not stake the plants upright. When the plants set fruit, they may droop and come into contact with the growing medium.  When the tomato plants bloom, since there are no insects in your hydroponics environment to pollinate them, you will need to do it yourself. Wait until the petals bend back to expose the round pistil and the pollen-covered stamens, or long, thin sticks at the flower center. Touch a soft paintbrush to each of the pollen-covered stamens, then touch the rounded end of the pistil. Repeat daily.  During "daylight" hours, the air temperature should be 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 C). At night it should be 55 to 65 °F (12.8 to 18.3 °C).Use thermostats and fans to regulate the air temperature. Monitor the temperature while the plants grow, as it could change with the climate or tomatoes' life cycle.   Pay attention to the growing solution temperature as well. This should be between 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. However, you do not need to keep it exactly within this range. If it goes slightly outside of it, then that is fine. Just avoid letting the growing solution temperature go below 60 degrees Fahrenheit or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit., A fan that exhausts to the outside or another room may help keep the temperature even throughout the room. The air flow it creates may also make pollination easier, although to be certain of growing fruit you may wish to pollinate by hand anyway, as described below.  Choose a nutrient solution made for hydroponics, not ordinary fertilizer. Avoid "organic" solutions, which may decompose and make caring for your system more complicated.Because the needs of your system vary with tomato variety and mineral content of your water, you may need to adjust the amount or type of nutrient solution you use. To begin with, however, follow the instructions on the packaging to determine how much you need to add to the reservoir.   Two part nutrient solutions create less waste and can be adjusted if problems arise simply by mixing them in different amounts, making them preferable to one-part solutions.You may wish to use a growth-focused formula while the tomatoes grow, then switch to a bloom formula once they flower to meet their new nutrient needs.  Use a pH test kit or litmus paper to test the pH of your nutrient and water mix once it's had time to become an even mixture. If the pH is not within the range of 5.8–6.3, ask a hydroponics store or gardening store employee about materials that can be used to lower or raise the pH. You can adjust the pH with acidic or basic additions to the reservoir.   Phosphoric acid can be used to lower pH, while potassium hydroxide can be used to raise it.  Artificial "grow lights" will allow you to simulate ideal growing conditions year round, providing your tomatoes with many more hours of "sunlight" than the garden outside may be receiving. This is one of the major benefits of an indoor growing system. However, if you are using a greenhouse or other area that receives high amounts of natural light, you may accept a shorter growing season and save money on electric bills.   Metal halide lamps simulate sunlight most accurately, making them a popular choice for hydroponics systems. Fluorescent, sodium, and LED grow lights are also available, but may cause slower or differently shaped growth. Avoid incandescent lights, which are inefficient and short-lived compared to other options., An electrical conductivity meter or "EC meter" may be expensive, but it is the best way of measuring the concentration of nutrients in the water. Results outside the range of 2.0–3.5 indicate that the water should be changed or partially changed. EC meter testing works best if you are using a two part fertilizer. If you do not have an EC meter, look for the following signs in your tomato plants:Leaf tips curling downward may mean the solution is too concentrated. Dilute with pH 6.0 water. Leaf tips curling upward or a red stem suggest the pH is too low, while yellow leaves indicate the pH is too high or the solution is too dilute. In any of these scenarios, change the solution as described below.  If the water level in the reservoir drops, add more water, but do not add more nutrients. Every two weeks, or once a week if your plants do not look healthy, empty the reservoir completely and rinse the support material and roots of the tomato plants with pure, pH 6.0 water to leach away mineral buildup that could cause harm.Fill the reservoir with a new water and nutrient solution, making sure to balance the pH and let the mixture become even before you start the water pump.   You may use the water used for leaching to water regular garden plants.	Decide which type of system to use. Find a suitable location. Fill a large, plastic container with water to use as a reservoir. Fix a tray in place above the reservoir. Install a water pump inside the reservoir. Install fill tubing between the reservoir and the tray. Install an overflow fitting leading back to the reservoir. Attach a timer to the water pump. Test the system. Grow tomato seeds in a special material. Place seedlings under artificial light once they sprout. Move seedlings into the hydroponic system. Set the water pump timer. Set your artificial lights (if applicable). Stake and prune tall tomato plants. Pollinate the tomato plant blossoms. Control the temperature. Run a fan in the room (optional). Add a nutrient solution to the reservoir of water. Use a pH test kit to test the water. Install grow lights (recommended). Monitor the water regularly. Change the water and nutrient solution regularly.
Your new closet door/bookshelf will be bigger than the 1 you already have, so make sure there is enough space in the room.  Draw a diagram of a shelving unit with approximately 4 to 5 shelves, depending upon your preference.  If you believe there will not be space in your room for 5.5 inch (14 cm) shelves, you can make them more shallow. This will still give the effect of a bookshelf, but may only be suitable for knick knacks instead of books. You will need to account for the fact that your top shelf pieces must be the exact width of the door, while your shelves will need to be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) skinnier to account for 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood on each side. Subtract 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the side shelf panels to account for the same measurement.  Buy 2 to 3 sheets of 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood. One home improvement source recommends using birch veneer plywood., You will need a work table and an outlet for a circular saw., When using a saw, you will need safety goggles and a breathing mask. It is always a good idea to wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants.	Measure the height and width of your closet door frame. Plan to make the shelves approximately 5.5 inches (14 cm) deep. Visit a home improvement store with the dimensions of your door. Set up a work station in your home. Put on your work clothes.
Craft or dollar stores are great places to find artificial flowers.; , With a pair of scissors, cut the stem off of the fake flower. You want to make sure to cut enough off so that you are now working with a flat surface.  Let the glue heat up for a few minutes before working with it.    Press it against the base of a blank pin for 15 seconds. If you want something for your hair instead, glue the flower onto a plain barrette. Depending on the size of the pin or barrette you get, you may be able to fit more than one flower onto your new accessory. , After the flower is attached to the pin or barrette, decorate your flower as desired.   Use the hot glue gun for this as well. Be creative! If you'd like, glue on sequins, beads or crystals to the fabric of the flower or to the remainder of the pin or barrette. ,	Assemble the items. Trim the stem. Prepare the glue. Glue on the base of the flower. Let the glue dry for several hours before wearing.  , Decorate. Let the glue dry again for a few hours before wearing.  , Finished.
Choose something you think you'll enjoy to avoid getting bored. Go online and look at reviews on large sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb to see if it's a good movie.; , You may have to buy them in advance at an online site, or go to the box office early to make sure it's not sold out.  Normally, theater lobbies will be jam-packed with people on weekends, so allow 20-30 minutes to get your tickets, get snacks, and then get good seats. Allow extra time for blockbusters, like a Harry Potter film or The Hunger Games.  If you have kids with you, limit how many extra items they can have. Try not to buy a lot of snacks: the movie seats are generally small, and you won´t focus in the movie if you have to rescue that falling super-size stack of candy.  A great way to save money on snacks is if you put a box of candy in your purse and pockets. Buy drinks at the theater; if you put them in your bag, they may leak.  No theater in their right mind is going to ask to search your pants pocket for snacks - too much risk of a sexual harassment lawsuit.  If you planned ahead and arrived early, you might be able to sit at a desirable seat. The best seats in most cinemas are at the back of the room because you won´t have those annoying seat-kickers, or in the middle as you will have the best view there. Try not to arrive late, or these seats might be occupied by people.  After you have watched the movie, you can discuss the movie with friends or family that you went with.	Decide on what to watch. Know how to get the tickets. The movie schedule must be at your fingertips. Buy snacks and be prepared to pay more. Most movie theaters like it if you buy food from them, but they normally don't enforce the rule. If you're bringing your own snacks, wear cargo pants - it's far easier to stash snacks in cargo pockets (just don't stuff them to the gills). Pick your seats. Discuss the film.
In addition to checking with your insurance company directly, contact your credit card company as well. Many major credit card companies include insurance coverage for rental cars. If they do, use your card to reserve your rental and receive these benefits.Ask your credit card company about what is and isn’t covered, and consider adding to the coverage through the car rental company Be aware that some countries require coverage for theft, which you pay to the rental car company., For instance, ask if anything specific is required to drive along the route you’ll be taking, or if there is any additional information you should know. Further, ask about whether you can take the vehicle into other countries.Simply say something along the lines of, “Will my insurance cover me if I cross an international border?” It’s best to share your anticipated itinerary with the rental car company to prevent unexpected fines or a potential lack of coverage.  There are a few assumptions about renting a car that you should avoid. Perhaps foremost, do not assume you can return the vehicle at any time, or in any location. Some rental companies will charge you a fee for returning a vehicle outside of certain hours, or for returning it to an unspecified location.Additionally, do not assume the cheapest option is the best. For one - it will likely be a manual transmission. If you do not know how to drive a stick shift, don’t assume you’ll be able to learn while driving abroad.	Check with your credit card company about insurance. Ask the rental company’s employee any specific questions. Plan a specific return time and location.
It can be either hard plastic, or metal. Don't use less than a 25 gallon (94.6 L) can, but the bigger the size, the more composting materials it will hold. Do NOT use a liner.; , You can begin to add the bottom table of compost. This can be several types of materials, and can be compacted down to about the first 6 or 7 inches (15.2 or 17.8 cm) of the bottom of the can.  Fill the bottom of the can with these materials first, making sure that you cover the bottom part of the trash can. The next layer can be mostly any materials that you want to put in. Table scraps (except meat and bones), manure, fill dirt, leaves and small twigs, etc. At this point, mix some pulverized limestone in water, and pour this mix of limestone and water onto the top of the compost materials. Continue to stir the limestone so it will stay in the solution of the water. Be liberal here, as this sweetens the acidic soil, and helps add calcium to the bin.  If you are going to leave the bin somewhere for a long long time, you may want to add lots of materials at one time. One good thing about a trash can is that it does have a lid. Keep it covered with the lid as much as possible at first, then if you know its going to rain, take of the top and let natures rainwater give a dose of moisture as often as possible. Put the trash can upon brick, blocks or rocks and put a tray below it to capture organic fertilizer that will be useful in many ways.  Alternate between leaves, cured grass clippings, dirt and manure, chopped up greens of any kind, table scraps, and fill the can about three quarters of the way to the top with these items. Once again, be liberal with the pulverized limestone mixed in rainwater, or non chlorinated water. You can also use pelleted limestone, as it will break down over time.  Red Wigglers are the normal choice, and you can get them pretty cheap. They work the compost materials quickly, and you don't need to feed them anymore at the top. You can use night crawlers too, but they often need shade, and cooler temperatures. Red Wigglers can often breed rapidly, and they can stand a range of temps. Use as many as you want to, but using at least 6 to 8 pounds or more of these worms for this bin is a good idea.  Materials should be extremely damp, but not soaking wet. Put a tray below the compost bin to catch the water that flows out. This is highly enriched organic fertilizer that you can use on flower gardens, plants, or just about any other use.  After 3 months, empty your compost bin completely, and remove castings, replace materials and put your worms back into the bin for the next session. Put castings into your garden, flowers bins, or sell them for profit. Gardeners will pay you for this type of composting fertilizers. It makes plants grow and produce many more garden veggies.	Get a new or used trash can. After you have rinsed and cleaned the bin with warm water and a soft brush, drill a few holes in the bottom to release excess moisture. Start by laying down a nice thick bed of wet straw, shredded paper, cured grass clippings, clay and silt, not too rich in sand though, but you can use potting soils that do not have chemicals added. Choose a place for your bin that is partially shaded, so it will not over heat in the hot summer sun, and kill your worms. Layer the materials, and do not stir or mix them. Once you are about three quarters to the top, add your worms. Once the worms are added, and they have gone into the top of the materials, water generously from the top with rainwater, or non chlorinated water. Check on the compost bin from time to time, and if some materials have decayed enough, it may be wise to remove some of it, and replace it with new layers of organic materials.
Begin the hydro dip process by deciding what you want to paint, then pick paint colors and find a water-tight container large enough to accommodate the object. You can use one color of spray paint, or several colors to swirl into cool designs with a disposable wooden stick. Purchase spray sealant (available at art stores or hardware stores) to seal your colorful design onto the object after hydro dipping, as well as protective gloves.The plastic container should be large enough that it won’t overflow if the object being painted is submerged in it. Buckets, large plastic storage containers, and feed tubs are all good options. If you do not wish to get paint on the container you are using, line it with plastic sheeting before pouring in the water.  If you can, set up outdoors (e.g. in your driveway or on the lawn) to avoid having your home smell like spray paint fumes. Make sure all of the items you will need are within arm’s reach, as the process of hydro dipping can go very quickly. Fill your container about ¾ full with lukewarm or warm water, as the ideal temperature for spray paint is between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 10 to 32 degrees celsius).If you have to set up indoors, open as many windows and doors as possible and nearby furniture with plastic sheeting. Make sure to keep children and pets away from the area while you paint.  In the event that certain spots on the object do not get covered in paint when you dip it, apply a base coat color that will show through. Use spray paint to coat the entire surface of the object. Let it dry for 2-3 hours before you start the hydro dip process., Make sure to shake the spray paint cans thoroughly to mix the paint before applying it. Hold the can 10 to 12 inches (approximately 25-30 cm) from the surface of the water and spray it to your heart’s content until the surface is coated. Switch between colors as desired to make your own unique creation.Colors will swirl together naturally on the water’s surface. To make smaller swirls, use a clean wooden stick to stir the colors until you’re left with a design you like.  Put on gloves and make sure that the object you are painting is free of dust or debris. Slowly dip it into the container until it is fully submerged. Slowly pull the object back out of the water.If you do not wish for the object you dipped to receive a second coat of paint on its way out of the water (which might alter the original swirl pattern of the paint), part the paint on the water’s surface before pulling the object out of the container. Having a second person to help you would be a big help for this step!  , Place the painted object on a plastic sheet or piece of cardboard to air dry. To make sure it is completely dry, let it sit for several hours before touching it. If you leave the object indoors to dry, make sure it is left somewhere safe where children or pets will not have access to it., To keep your hydro dip paint looking fresh and clean, spray it with a clear spray sealant (available in hardware stores in matte, semi-gloss, or gloss finish). Spray an even coat over the object and let it dry for several hours. Apply the sealant only after the object is completely dry.	Gather what you need. Set up the painting area. Apply a base coat. Spray paint onto the water’s surface. Dip the object in the container of paint and water. Leave the object to dry. Use a clear, spray sealant.

Plastic and glass bottles can be acquired cheaply in most supermarket and online. If you want to make a good gesture for the environment or save money, you can clean and recycle an old bottle with dispenser instead of buying a new one.   Choose a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bottle. Remember that you want to use it for a long period of time. If possible, test a few bottles. Make sure that the pump works well and look for a sturdy bottle which can survive a fall on the floor.; , Washing your hands can damage the skin. If you suffer from hand dryness, irritation, itching or cracks, look for hypoallergenic or scent-free soap. Examine the label. The most common allergic reactions are caused by the following ingredients: QAC, iodine, iodophors, chlorhexidine, triclosan, chloroxylenol and alcohols. Look for a soap with moisturizer to protect the skin of your hands.  Pour tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Shake well to mix the gel and the water until they form a liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.   Add the water first. If you don't, the water will make the soap foam up. Do not fill the bottle beyond two thirds of the way. If you do, the bottle will overflow when you screw the cap back on. If the dispenser pump is not springing back to the up position, rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the dispenser stem to get it freely moving again. The mixture must be diluted enough to flow through the pump. If the dispenser is clogged, clean it and add more water to the mixture.	Buy or recycle an empty bottle with a dispenser pump. Buy the right bottle of gel soap refill. Mix the ingredients.
Your pot should have a somewhat large gap in it from the broken section of the pot. However, the base of the pot should be intact. Fill the pot a quarter of the way with soil, with the soil sloping upwards away from the broken section of the pot.Depending on the size of your pot and its broken section, you may need to use more or less soil. The goal at this point is to put enough soil in your pot so that you can nest your large potsherd in it. A general potting soil, which is sometimes called potting or container mix, should work well for the plants in your fairy garden.; , If both the upper corners of your large potsherd are still attached, put on safety glasses and use a hammer to break off a corner. If you've broken the right corner, nest the large potsherd in the soil inside the pot so its left side touches the left side of the pot, or vice versa.The gap in the corner will allow a space for you to use smaller potsherds, stacked on sloping soil, to create a potsherd stairway.  With your hands or a hand spade, add more soil to your pot. Fill it about ¾ of the way full, and arrange the dirt so it holds the large potsherd in place. Your dirt should slope upwards away from the broken segment of the pot, with the greater portion of the soil in the main part of the pot, behind the large potsherd.The shape of your large potsherd or the size of your pot might require you to adjust the amount of dirt you add at this point in the project.  If you don't have small potsherds, take your hammer and break the corner you removed from your large potsherd into pieces. If you already have small pieces of potsherd:Layer the small pieces of potsherd on the sloping dirt in an ascending fashion. These should spiral up the sloping dirt to the gap in one of the corners of the large potsherd. Press the potsherds into the soil or add a little soil to firmly fix the smaller potsherds in place.  Now that your potsherds are in place, you can add plants. Choose those that look like normal, everyday plants (like trees, shrubs, and so on), but miniature. This will give your garden the atmosphere that it was cultivated by little fairies.   Succulents, bonsai plants, and moss are well suited for creating this kind of atmosphere, but feel free to experiment.Tiny flowering plants will make your fairy garden appear to be a miniature flower garden tended by little fairies. Try plants like Baby's Breath, Alsike Clover (Trifolium hybridum), Black Swallow Wort (Cynanchum nigrum), Blue Curls (Trichostema dichotomum), and more.	Fill your broken pot with soil. Nest a large potsherd in the soil. Add more soil to the pot. Build a staircase with smaller potsherds. Decorate the pot with suitable plants.
Many garden supply stores sell special blends, and you may have more success with a potting mix designed to promote rose growth than with a generic soil.    A simple blend includes a sterile non-soil potting medium, like fine bark, mixed in equal parts with perlite to lighten the mixture. Another common blend includes 40 percent topsoil mixed with 30 percent perlite and 30 percent screened compost.	Select a potting soil specifically blended for roses. Create your own soil blend.
Like wood, stainless steel products also have a “grain.” When you clean, polish, or sand stainless steel, you always need to work in the direction of the grain. To identify the direction of the grain:   Look closely at the stainless steel door. You will see tiny brush strokes—these brush strokes indicate the direction of the grain. Note if the grain (brushstrokes) is moving horizontally or vertically.; , When removing scratches from stainless steel, it is important that you begin your work on a clean surface. If sanded or buffed, excess dirt, grime, stuck on materials, and loose materials left on your fridge could cause further damage to your door. You may clean the door with a polishing cleanser powder, such as Bon Ami, Comet, or Ajax.   Wet the entire surface of the fridge door with water. Sprinkle a gentle polishing cleanser powder onto the wet door. Dampen a clean sponge. Move the sponge across the surface of the door in the direction of the grain to combine the product with the water. Rinse the fridge door with water. Pat it dry with a clean microfiber cloth., Cleaning vinegar is 1% more acidic than traditional white vinegar. The additional acidity allows this mild, yet powerful, cleaning product to cut through greasy fingerprints with ease. Prior to removing any scratches, use this product to cleanse the surface of your fridge door.   Pour the cleaning vinegar into a small bucket. Wet a clean cloth with undiluted cleaning vinegar. Moving in the direction of the grain, wipe down the surface of your fridge door with the damp cloth Wiping with the grain, remove any excess vinegar with a dry cloth., There are several products on the market designed specifically for cleaning stainless steel. Select a product that you are comfortable using to remove dirt, oil, and stuck on materials from your fridge door. Before applying the product, always read the directions listed on the cleaning product.   Be sure to note any recommended safety precautions, such as wearing gloves., When applied with a little elbow grease, gentle polishing cleaners can buff out hairline scratches from your stainless steel fridge door. These cleansers, such as Bon Ami, Ajax, Comet, and specially formulated stainless steel cleaners, come in both a powder and a cream form.   If you are using a powder form, mix the product with water to form a paste. Apply the paste or the cream to the hairline scratch with a damp cloth or sponge. As you rub the paste or cream into the scratch, always move in the direction of the grain. Occasionally wipe away the cleaning product with a clean damp cloth and inspect the scratch. Continue to apply the cleaning product and buff the affected area until the scratch is no longer visible.If the scratch remains, try to remove the scratch with a mildly-abrasive product, like whitening toothpaste.  Unlike gentle polishing cleaners, whitening toothpaste is mildly abrasive. If the gentle polishing cleaner did not remove the scratch, try to treat the marred area with a whitening toothpaste.   Coat the bristles of the toothbrush with the whitening toothpaste. Use the brush to apply the toothpaste directly to the minor scratch. As you work to buff out the scratch, always move the toothbrush in the direction of the grain. Periodically remove wipe away the toothpaste with a wet rag and assess the scratch. Wipe in the direction of the grain. Continue to apply the whitening toothpaste to the scratch until it is no longer present. Once the scratch is gone, wipe away the toothpaste with a clean, damp rag. Condition the area you cleaned with metal polish or olive oil., If the scratch in your refrigerator door is deep, it is possible to sand out the prominent gash. Always contact the manufacturer to determine which grit is acceptable to use on your fridge door.   Wet the scratched area with a sponge or cloth saturated with water. Throughout the process, keep the surface wet. Wet a piece of sandpaper with water. Throughout the process, make sure the sandpaper remains wet. Move the wet sandpaper lightly over the scratch in the same direction of the grain. Feather out from the scratch to blend in the affected area. Once the scratch is removed to your satisfaction, wipe the area with a wet rag in the direction of the grain. Pat the area dry with a microfiber cloth. Condition the treated area with a metal polish or olive oil. You may use a chloride-free paste In addition to water, If your fridge door is severely scratched or has multiple scratches, you may want to consider purchasing a stainless steel scratch removal kit. These kits are sold at home repair shops and online. The kits typically contain a sanding block, three abrasive pads, a lubricant, and an instructional video.   Always read and follow the instructions provide by the product’s manufacturers. Affix the finest grit sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant. Sand the affected area in the direction of the grain. If the scratch is not vanishing, affix the next coarsest sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant. Sand the affected area in the direction of the grain. If the scratch still remains, affix the coarsest sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant and sand the affected area in the direction of the grain. Once the scratch vanishes, use the same grit sandpaper to treat the entire stainless steel door in the direction of the grain., If you are not a diy-er or your fridge is severely damaged, consider hiring a professional stainless steel refinishing and polishing company to complete the work for you. A professional repairman will be able to assess the damaged fridge and provided you with a variety of repair options. If the scratch or scratches can not be buffed or sanded out, the repairman may suggest refinishing, or sanding, the entire fridge door., If you have exhausted all potential repair options, consider replacing the fridge door. Contact the manufacturer to inquire about the availability and cost of a new fridge door.   The only way to repair dented stainless steel is to replace the part.	Identify the grain. Clean the door with a gentle polishing cleanser powder. Remove dirt and grime from your fridge with cleaning vinegar. Clean your fridge door with your favorite stainless steel cleaning product. Try to buff out a minor scratch with a non-abrasive cleaner first. Try to buff out a minor scratch with a soft bristle toothbrush and whitening toothpaste next.

Since Troll Dolls are from the past, one of the only ways to find them is to go to a thrift shop, trade center or antique store. Another trend is some comic stores are starting to sell vintage tool figurines and there's also vintage stores that sell all 40s to 90s stuff Ebay is also a great source to find rare trolls and have a variety of options.  Be selective! Only go after the ones that really capture your heart instead of every model of a troll doll there is. Like all collecting this too can get addictive very quickly.	Shop around different kinds of stores to find the Troll Dolls.
You'll probably want to be a female pirate if you are a female and vice versa, but it's up to you. Many female pirate depictions are quite inappropriate -- if you're not looking for that, consider just girling up a male pirate's outfit.; , This can help to guide your pirate costume crafting, but it's certainly not essential. It's likely to be useful where there is something unusual or fascinating about the costume of a particular pirate that you'd like to emulate.  For pirate crew, your top doesn't need to be as fancy as that which would be worn by the pirate captain or long-term senior pirate crew. A t-shirt will serve adequately. A larger shirt is best to give the idea of rugged sloppiness, which all good pirates attempt to get across.  You've been at sea for months. Though you don't want to pretend you have scurvy, make it seem you're a little worse for the wear. Cut areas of the t-shirt to give an impression of ruggedness:   Cut off the ends of the sleeves in a jagged fashion. Cut the bottom of the t-shirt off. Pirates don't need hems. Cut off the neckline of the t-shirt. $10 says Hanes was not around in the era of your pirate.  Also paint lines around the sleeves. These don't need to be perfect––the more homemade they look, the better.   Allow the paint to dry, then flip the t-shirt over and paint the back the same way.  If you'd rather wear a shirt than a t-shirt, that's fine too, especially if you're trying to be a pirate captain. A big, billowy white shirt is ideal. Try to locate one which has flowing sleeves rather than tight ones.   For women, choose a man's shirt as it will be bigger and more likely to billow. For men, avoid anything that's too tight or too short.  Pirates don't wear stiff business collars. Away with it (give it the plank!) by snipping it off and restoring a ruffle or similar soft collar instead. If you hate sewing, you can probably get away with using fabric glue to attach a ruffle but ensure that the area that has been cut won't fray.   If possible, just try tucking in your ruffle to your neckline. The volume of the ruffle will cover up any self-improvements you've made to your shirt.  Since you're wearing a decent shirt, it's more about upgrading than turning it to tatters. Consider some of the following embellishments:   Fancy buttons for both the middle and cuffs A golden or silver chain toggle for the collar area Ruffles! Ay, matey. Ruffles can be added almost anywhere on the shirt ––around the cuffs, around the collar, down the button line, etc.  Let the rest of the costume do the talking. In days of yore, no pirate was donning floral-printed pants, so don't worry about your pants making a statement.   If preferred, you can wear a long skirt with petticoats underneath. It's best if it billows out, to allow freedom of movement. This is something female pirates might like to wear in place of trousers.  You could paint stripes on a plain pair of pants to give them more of a pirate vibe. Use fabric paint to paint on vertical stripes. The color can be matched to the pants or any other part of your pirate outfit. Perhaps you're part of a pirate gang?   Another alternative is to wear pants but to wear a coat tailored to hug around the front with tails in the back like a full skirt. This would probably be something you need to sew yourself or have tailored, but it can be a nice combination of pants and dress.  Keep it plain and dark in color; if it fits the vibe of your pirate, leave it unbuttoned so that your shirt or t-shirt can be seen underneath. Classier pirates may want to be proper and stay buttoned-up.   For a colder night, wear a very long, free flowing overcoat. It can have seen better days, provided it's not a tight fit. Search in thrift stores for such a coat. Again, it's best kept a darker color but can be colorful or patterned if you're a flamboyant pirate.  Use this measurement to get the size of the pirate hat accurate. This is the part that tends to make the pirate costume. Fortunately, it's very easy to make a pirate's hat.  Use this as the template. If you're not confident in this, one can be found online.   Place the template over lightweight card and trace around it. Do this twice, as you need two sides to the hat. Cut out the hat shape.  Run glue or tape around the edges of the hat, leaving the base of the hat where your head goes in untouched. Let dry if using glue.  Go over with at least two coats and let dry. Then paint on the skull and crossbones design in white. Again, if you're not super artsy, print this off the internet and glue on.   If you're using paint, this may take two coats; white over black at first is gray. Be patient -- your hat is one of the flashiest parts of your outfit -- put the time in to make it right.  Tape this together in a loop or circle. Slide this inside the hat and tape or glue to the hat. This will help to keep the hat shape open and keep it snugly on your head.   If it's really windy out and you're forced to become an outdoor pirate, add elastic to keep the hat in place. Only do this as a last option though, as it can look a bit bulky and silly.  A bright red bandana around the neck will stand out and is something a pirate might well have worn. If you don't have one, make one!   Cut a piece of red fabric in a large square shape. Fold the square into a triangle. Wrap around your neck. Tie the ends at the back of your neck and have the bandana tips pointed downward at the front of your neck.  A belt around your shirt or t-shirt is a perfect pirate touch. You can either wear a very wide belt you've found in your own wardrobe or from the thrift store, or you can make a belt from fabric or card.   Some pirates wore (or "wear" in the images on Google) a belt that more resembles a sash. If you have a black or red scarf, it can easily be turned into a pirate belt.  Eye patches can be purchased from costume stores or online, or you can make your own:   Draw the shape of an eye patch on a piece of lightweight card. Cut out the patch. Paint the outer side black. Let dry. Pierce two holes into the top of the patch on either side of it. Thread in the ends of thin elastic and knot in place. Check that the length of elastic is just right for going around your head before cutting and knotting the final hole.  Holes are perfectly fine provided you're not jumping puddles or snow. Add a buckle to improve the look of an old pair of boots, especially if you're a pirate captain   The more worn, the better. Hit up your local thrift shops for shoes you will probably never wear again -- or at least not until next year. , Just mascara and eyeshadow is good. If you're an evil pirate, this goes double. Shade your creases to give the look of added depth.   You don't necessarily have to mirror Jack Sparrow, but his is certainly a good look.  Wear a pair of big golden circle earrings if you are a woman; if you're male, one is good. Ear(s) not pierced? A lot of costume jewelry just snaps right on.  Fashion it like a headband -- a true pirate wears it like a sweatband. But yours can be much more fashionable and a little Bohemian.  Cut a cutlass or sword from cardboard. Paint the blade end silver and the handle end brown. You can slip this into your belt when not carrying it.   Plastic ones are pretty cheap and abundant in costume or party shops, too. Your entertainment will be provided all night -- just be careful not to knock too many things over or poke someone in the eye.  Use a tube from kitchen wrap or similar. Paint it black. Then attach a silver band about a quarter of a way from the top, to section it. Add another silver band to one end, which looks like the end the pirate looks through. You can attach this to your belt with a piece of elastic.	Decide if you want to be a man or a woman. Find a pirate image. Select a large white t-shirt that you're willing to change. Start sculpting. Paint blue stripes across the shirt using fabric paint. Find a suitable shirt. Lose the stiff collar. Embellish a little. Choose dark colored pants for a conservative or simple look. Fix up an ordinary pair of pants. Consider wearing a vest that opens at the front. Measure your head. Draw a pirate's hat shape on a piece of paper. Stick or glue the hat together. Paint the hat black. Cut a band of card that fits your head precisely. Wear a bandana around your neck. Add a pirate belt. Rock an eye patch. Wear old shoes or boots.Wear skulls or gold jewels like thick necklaces and earrings. Put some black makeup around your eyes. Wear at least one earring. Wear a scarf around or in your hair if you are a woman. Carry a cardboard cutlass or sword. Make a telescope.
Heavy equipment may be used to clear the footprint of the building, plants and unsuitable material should be removed, and the subgrade should be inspected to determine if it will give adequate support for the slab and the structure that will be built on it.   Have the site surveyed or layout the building lines yourself. Batterboards may be used, or corner stakes can be set to allow building lines to be pulled and grades to be established for clearing and grading. Grub out trees, bushes, and other plants, including their roots so they will not leave voids in the subgrade when they decay.  Remove any mucky or otherwise unsuitable material from the subgrade. Proof roll or use another method to compact the disturbed subgrade soil material.; , For monolithic slabs, there may simply be a turn down edge, but for many buildings, a spread footing is poured, then CMU (concrete masonry units, commonly called block) are layed up to finished floor grade.  Building lines which have been laid out on the outside building line and on grade (at the proper elevation), will allow you to form the edges of the slab straight and level.  Bathtub drainpipes and commode flanges are often blocked out so the traps can be installed when the fixture is set into position later.    Capillary fill is used where moisture may create a problem. Crushed limestone or other aggregate base materials can be used for slabs with heavy loads like warehouse floors and aircraft hangars. Cohesive materials like clay are sometimes used where the subgrade cannot be sufficiently stabilized using conventional methods.  For engineered buildings, testing the density of the fill may be required to meet the architect's specifications. This is usually done by a geo-technical engineering laboratory.  This is usually done by a bonded and licensed pest control company.  This will help prevent the chemicals from evaporating, and will prevent the subgrade from drying out and becoming loose.  Make sure it is supported so that it will be positioned in the correct location after the concrete is placed and has set. Using concrete chairs is an effective method of doing this.  For wide spans, you will want to set grades or some type of screed guide to allow the screed operators to keep the concrete flat, or at the required slope. Pipe screeds are used in the placement shown in the photographs, but other techniques may be used, including grade stakes, or using a laser level and target to set wet screeds.  This should be done early in the process so that concrete trucks and other required equipment will be able to get into the area they will need access to during the concrete placement.   Aerial pumps can place concrete to specific areas of the slab via an articulated boom and hose assembly up to 120 feet (36.6 m) from the concrete truck. They are often used for placing concrete on elevated decks or in inaccessible locations. Line pumps also use pipes and hoses to move the concrete from the truck to the placement location, but require a lot of labor to move the hoses around while in use. Concrete buckets can be used for placing the concrete in high locations or inaccessible areas using a crane or forklift. Georgia buckets are self-propelled wagons that can maneuver in tight locations to place concrete. Chuting or tailgating is discharging the concrete directly from the truck into the form. , Measuring the length times the width, then multiplying it by the depth, in feet or a decimal fraction thereof will give you the total cubic feet of material required. To convert this number to cubic yards, divide it by 27. Allow enough extra concrete to fill any monolithic footings, depressed slabs, and low areas in the fill material.  This means both the date and time of the pour, and the interval of delivery for multiple trucks to arrive on the job site so the concrete crew has time to discharge and tend to each truckload, while not having to wait for the next truck to arrive.  Testing labs often perform the following tests:   Slump. This test determines the plasticity of the concrete material. A vertical cone shaped mold is filled with concrete and the amount the concrete slumps is measured, to make sure it is not too wet to meet specification for the job. Temperature. Concrete suffers detrimental effects when it becomes too hot, so the temperature of the product is monitored during placement. Air entrainment. Chemicals are added to the concrete to ensure air is entrained in the mixture. These tiny voids will allow the concrete to expand and contract more before cracking when concrete is expected to be subjected to large temperature variations over time. A typical air entrainment requirement is 3-5%. Compressive strength. Concrete strength is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), and special plastic molds are used to collect samples of the material which are later used in the testing lab's laboratory to determine the concrete's strength.  Things to consider are these:   Make sure you have sufficient manpower to perform the job. Check the weather conditions. These factors can contribute to concrete setting times:  Temperature. The higher the temperature, the faster the concrete will set, and very hot conditions will affect the ability of the workers to perform. Humidity. Very low humidity will allow for the water in the concrete to evaporate more quickly. Wind. Wind can increase the speed the surface of the concrete will dry. Cold weather can greatly increase the setting time for concrete. Placing concrete at near freezing temperatures or when freezing conditions are expected during the next 48 hours is not recommended. Sunshine. Concrete will set more quickly in bright sunny conditions than it will in cloudy conditions.    If a concrete pump truck is to be used, have it arrive an hour or so early to allow it to be set up and in position, and to let the pump operator get an idea of the placement plan. Service troweling machines, including checking the controls, the blades, and making sure they are full of engine oil and gasoline. Check straight edges, screed boards, power screeds, and bull floats to make sure they are in good condition. Make sure concrete vibrators are in good condition if the slab requires their use. Check personal safety equipment, such as gloves, rubber boots, and eye protection. Clean and check all hand tools so they are in good working condition.  Concrete can be placed in parallel sections as long as each subsequent section is placed before the prior section has begun to set up, or there will be cold joints between the two.  If needed, have a worker or two walk with the persons placing the concrete and use hooks to pull the wire up. Keeping the reinforcing in the proper position is critical to the strength of the slab.  Have finishers work around electrical conduits and plumbing pipes with hand tools to keep the surface level.  The person who bull floats the concrete may need a laborer to add concrete to any low areas he notices while performing this task.  This is the process of moving around the edge making sure the perimeter of the slab along the forms is flat and smooth. This is especially important if braces are anchored on top of the form, or if the forms are not flush and level.  If there is a hole left in the concrete when the screed or stake is removed, shovel additional concrete into it to flush it with the surface of the screeded concrete.  Once the concrete has been completely screeded, give someone the task of cleaning the tools used for placing the concrete, including the pipe screeds, bull floats, comealongs, and shovels.  If the edges have been properly floated, and the bull floaters have done a good job with the main areas, you will want to have the crew wait until the concrete gets hard enough to support workers on knee boards before continuing the finishing process. Check the concrete by pushing it with your gloved finger until it is unyielding.  Working around blocked out areas, pipe stub ups, rebar dowels, and other obstacles will often require considerable effort.  Waiting too long will mean to concrete is too hard to achieve a very good finish, but starting too early will mean the blades of the machine may dig into the concrete causing rutting, humps, and other problems.  This gives them more surface area, so they will not tend to sink in as they spin across the surface. Using a combination type blade, rather than a finishing blade is better for this step. , If the surface is flat and free of defects, you can allow the concrete to harden until it is ready for the finish troweling. Because the concrete is placed in a continuous operation, the first area that is poured will normally set up first, but be aware that areas exposed to hot sun or wind may get hard earlier than areas that were placed in a shaded, protected location.  For a hard troweled finish, you will raise the blades up on the machine as the concrete gets progressively harder, which in turn puts more pressure on a smaller area of the blade. ,, Make sure to remove any nails or screws that may present a hazard to workers handling these materials.	Prepare the area where the work will be done. Form and place any concrete foundations which will be below the slab. Set the forms for your slab. Install any roughed in plumbing or electrical pipes, as well as sleeves for air conditioning piping and wiring. Fill the slab area with a suitable material to finished grade. Compact and finish grade the fill material. Pretreat the fill and subgrade for insects using an approved and labeled termiticide. Install the required moisture barrier or waterproof membrane immediately after the termiticide is applied. Install the reinforcing wire or rebars required by the architect/engineer or your local building codes. Plan the method you are going to use to screed the concrete. Determine the method you will use to place the concrete in your forms. Check forms for alignment and make sure all braces are tight and well anchored so the weight of the concrete does not cause them to bow or fail during the pour.  , Calculate the quantity of concrete you will need to complete the slab. Order the concrete from a ready mix concrete supplier, and schedule the delivery to coincide with the concrete placement schedule. Coordinate concrete testing with a qualified testing laboratory if the construction contract requires it. Plan on beginning large slab placements as early as possible to allow time to complete the project successfully. Set up all equipment used in the concrete placement on the day of the pour. Begin the concrete placement at a corner and continuing placing the concrete along the grade or screed lines as you have established. Make sure the reinforcing wire mat or rebars are not forced to the bottom of the concrete while placing. Keep placing the concrete and pulling it roughly level with Come Alongs and screeding it off with a straightedge or power screed. Have one or two finishers, as the job requires, to bull float the concrete after it has been screeded. Give men the job of using hand floats the job of working the edges of the slab. Remove pipe screeds or grade stakes as each area is placed and screeded off. Continue pouring the concrete until the forms are filled to the finished grade of the slab. Allow the concrete to set. Have concrete finishers get on knee boards to work areas where a power trowel (troweling machine) cannot be operated. Set your troweling machine on the slab when the concrete is hard enough to support the workman without leaving deep footprints in its surface. Trowel the concrete with the blades at their flattest setting. Sprinkle a light mist of water on areas that do not respond to the troweling machine, particularly to help pull grout up to fill voids and cover any aggregate left exposed during bull floating.  , Let the concrete continue to set after it has been troweled the first time. Run the troweling machines over the concrete until the level of finish you desire is achieved. Apply a curing compound or use a curing technique to keep the concrete from drying too quickly, especially in extreme weather conditions resulting in rapid evaporation.  , Saw any joints required by the construction plans.  , Remove the forms and clean them for reuse on the next project.
Most band managers "discover" the artists they manage. You'll need to do some research and keep your eyes and ears open to find the right up-and-coming band.   Attending local shows is the best way for a band manager to find clients. Look for bars and clubs in your area that feature live music. Attend local music festivals and other outdoor events. When you find a group whose music you love, approach them and ask if they'd be interested in hiring you as a new manager. Talk to local contacts in the entertainment business. If you know anyone involved in the local music scene, ask their opinions about local bands. This is a great way to focus your search if you're not sure where to start. They may also be able to warn you about bands with bad reputations before you invest your time to find out the hard way. Don't forget to use social media. Use their search features to quickly find bands nearby. Many of these will even have a few songs uploaded. Give them a listen to see if they have potential. For the bands that seem interesting, follow up with a trip to their next local show.; , When you're just starting out and don't have many contacts in the industry, you may have to take some steps to get your name out there.   Leave a flyer or business card at places musicians frequent, such as instrument shops and practice spaces. Register accounts for your business on social media sites. Be sure to mention that you're accepting new clients. Try to match your aesthetics to the type of group you're interested in representing. For example, if you're interested in managing country music acts, you may want to include a picture of yourself wear a typical country outfit in your promotional materials. Wear some combination of denim, flannel, leather, and/or turquoise with a Stetson hat, western shirt, bolo tie, and/or a pair of cowboy boots. Make sure it's an outfit you would normally wear to avoid looking fake or over the top.  Don't manage a band whose music you do not personally enjoy. It's important to manage a band you can be passionate about.   Remember that that a major part of managing a band will be "selling" your band to other people, such as venue owners and record executives. If you genuinely love the music, you'll be better able to give a convincing sales pitch. Your devotion to the band will show through in all aspects of your work. When you're passionate about your job, you're more motivated to do it well. Believing in your band's success will help make it happen., You may not have this option when you're first starting out, but it's generally a bad idea to go into any type of business with friends and family. Under ideal situations, there is nothing wrong with it. However, business ventures are rarely ideal. If things don't work out, these relationships run a major risk of going sour.Sometimes there are exceptions when established relationships can actually help you be a better manager. When a loved-one's career is in your hands, you might be more motivated to do the best job possible., This applies to you, the members of the band, and anyone else you'll be spending a lot of time with, such as bus drivers and roadies. For a successful business relationship, you need to click on a personal level and work well together.   In addition to initial chemistry, you may need to help resolve interpersonal conflicts as your act matures. You'll be their coach, making sure they stay productive and together., Before you start managing your band, you'll need to do some research into relevant laws where you live.   Find out which roles you can legally take on as a band manager in your state. Although you don't need any formal certification to be a "band manager," some related work requires licensing. Typical examples of these are booking agent and accountant. These laws vary greatly between countries, states, and even cities. Information about these laws can be found on government and professional organization websites. You can also talk to a local entertainment lawyer for guidance. This step is incredibly important for securing your future success and income. If you accidentally overstep your legal role as manager, this may be used to nullify your contract., Most band managers work on commission, meaning that they take a set percentage of the band's profits. A typical commission for band managers is 20%, but established managers with proven track records sometimes ask for a higher rate.   Although not as common, some band managers charge their clients a set monthly retainer.These retainers vary widely and depend on the manager's experience, the band's income level, the services provided, and the local cost of living. This averages anywhere from $500 to $4000. If you've never managed a band before, it is probably prudent to start off much lower. It's also common for new band managers to "work on spec" either for free or at reduced rates for a period of time to prove their abilities. Consider setting a specific milestone for when it will be time to renegotiate your rates. This can be a set period of time (one to three months, for example) or a level of success for your band (when they begin to gross $1000 a month).  Once you've found a band and know what types of services you can provide, sit down with them and draw up a contract. In the contract, specify what you will do for them as a band manager and agree on what your compensation will be. Likewise, be clear about the band's own obligations.   If you're working on commission, be sure to define exactly what you're asking for a cut of. For example, if the band recorded an album before you began your partnership, are you entitled to a commission on future sales? Be sure this is clearly stated in the contract. This step is just as important when working with friends and family as it is with relative strangers. It might seem awkward to ask a friend to sign a legally-binding agreement, but it will actually prevent a lot of awkwardness in the long run. Remember that the contract should protect the interests of all parties involved. Human memory is fallible and miscommunication is a frequent cause of conflict. Having your expectations in writing makes them clear, explicit, and easy to refer back to., In many ways, this is your primary duty as a band manager. It is your responsibility to establish business contacts and market your band.   Examples of other professionals you are likely to deal with if your band takes off are booking agents, promoters, venue owners, record executives, lawyers, accountants, engineers, and road crews.Ask established industry contacts for recommendations. If you don't get enough leads that way, do your own research online to find professionals with good track records who you think would fit in well. For most of these hires, it's a good idea to get the band's input. This is especially important for sound engineers and road crews who will be working with the band directly on a regular basis.  Many band managers are always "on call." Business opportunities can come at unexpected times, and you'll need to be able to field calls and emails 24/7. You'll also need to be ready to take care of a crisis, no matter its size.   For example, if your lead singer ends up in the hospital the night before a show, it's your responsibility to let the venue know as soon as possible and to possibly arrange a new date for the performance., As a manager, a big part of your job will be to "sell" the band to other professionals and occasionally to potential fans. You are likely to be the one interfacing with media, managing interviews and pitching your band to advertising firms. In the early days while your band is relatively unknown, you may also choose to have a direct hand in marketing, possibly creating a website or designing flyers.   It's also common for a band to use a dedicated promoter instead. In this case, it will likely be your responsibility to find and vet one., As a manager, it may be your responsibility to secure work for your band. Look for venues and speak to the people there in charge of hiring live music. Negotiate the best fee for your band and have the venue agree to a rider if necessary.   In some areas, such as California, band managers cannot book concerts without a special license unless they are also a member of the band. Smaller bands can book their own shows, but you will likely need to find a booking agent to work with if your band takes off., Tour schedules can be tough to organize, as you'll need to coordinate with multiple venues to choose dates while also accounting for travel time. Additionally, even when you can't book the shows, there are many other aspects of a tour that need to be taken care of. When acting as tour manager, it will be your duty to secure transportation and book hotels in addition to everything else you normally do for local shows. Budgeting tours is an important skill you will need to develop, making sure to keep your band comfortable while also minimizing costs.	Scout for local talent. Advertise your services. Believe in the band you want to represent. Avoid managing people you have pre-established personal relationships with. Make sure all personalities involved are compatible. Familiarize yourself with entertainment law. Agree on compensation. Prepare a formal written contract. Negotiate with other professionals on your client's behalf. Be available at all times. Promote your band. Book shows for your band. Plan tours.
You may want to shift the transmission briefly through each of its gear settings before putting it in park.       ; , There's usually a lever on the inside of your car that pops the hood, usually near the left hand side of the cockpit. Consult your owner's manual if you are unable to find it.  On many newer cars, the transmission fluid pipe will be labeled; if not, consult your owner's manual for its location.          On a rear-wheel drive vehicle, the dipstick is usually in the rear of the engine, above the valve cover. On a vehicle with front-wheel drive, the dipstick is usually in the front of the engine and is connected to the transaxle, sticking straight up out of the transmission., On most cars, the car must idling in park with the parking brake on and the transmission hot. Wipe the dipstick on a clean rag or paper towel, reinsert it and pull it out again to check the transmission fluid level. The fluid level should be between two marks labeled either "Full" and "Add" or "Hot" and "Cold."          Usually, you should not have to add transmission fluid. If the level is down significantly below the "Add" or "Cold" line, you probably have a system leak and should take the car to your mechanic to have your car inspected for leaks by a technician.  Good automatic transmission fluid is usually red (although sometimes pink or light brown), without bubbles or odor. If any of the following conditions are true, take your car in for servicing.          If the transmission fluid is a discolored brown or smells burnt, the fluid has been overheated and it can no longer protect the transmission as designed. The fluid can be tested further by putting some on a clean paper towel and waiting 30 seconds to see if it spreads. If it does not, the transmission should be serviced, or the transmission itself will suffer serious damage. If the transmission fluid looks milky brown, it has been contaminated by coolant from the radiator through a leak in the automatic transmission fluid cooler. Take the car to your mechanic at once. If the transmission fluid is either foamy or bubbly, there may be too much fluid in the transmission or the wrong transmission fluid has been used.  Add the fluid a little at a time, rechecking the level periodically, until it is at the correct level.          If you've drained the care completely, you will probably need to add between three and four quarts of transmission fluid.Otherwise, check the dipstick regularly to avoid overfilling the fluid pan.  This process allows the newly added transmission fluid to circulate and properly coat each gear, lubricating it. Start with the engine running and the car in park, if possible with the wheels off the ground. Go through First all the way to Third, including Drive, Overdrive, and Reverse gears. When finished, place the vehicle in park and let it idle to warm the fluid.  Inspect the dipstick, as transmission fluid may have lowered from being circulated through the clutch packs, purging any air from the system. Add fluid as needed to bring to the correct level.  Depending on whether you're just giving your transmission fluid a top-up or you're replacing the entire pan with new transmission fluid, you may need to add extra fluid at this point.          If you're simply topping up, you may need to only add only a quart of fluid, or even less. If you've drained the fluid from the pan, removed the pan and replaced the filter, you may need to add anywhere from 4 to 12 quarts, depending on the make and model.  Your car's transmission fluid is now properly set and your car should be humming along.	Park your car on a level surface with the engine running. Raise the hood. Find the automatic transmission fluid pipe. Pull out the transmission fluid dipstick. Check the condition of the transmission fluid. Add transmission fluid, if necessary. Run the car and take it through each gear if possible. Check the dipstick again to determine how much additional fluid you may need to add, if any. Add the necessary amount of fluid to bring it to its proper level. Finished.
To add even more detail to the rock, you can use acrylic paint to paint a colorful theme on the rock, which matches the photos displayed above the rock or figurine.  Paint the rock according to the theme of the pictures being displayed. When you have a beach-like theme, you can paint a small landscape of the beach on the rock. When you have a camping theme, you can paint a small campground with trees and mountains on the rock.  You can use scrap booking embellishments or card making embellishments to add elaborate detail to the photo holder.  Once the base is dry, you can begin attaching your wires to the base.	Use a rock or figurine that has a hole in the middle that extends all the way to the bottom of the figurine. Paint the rock with acrylic paint. Apply embellishments to the rocks when you don't have paint on hand or when you want to add detail that is difficult to paint. Wait for the paint on the rock to dry.
If you're considering getting into improv, the best way to know for sure is to take a class. Joining an improv class will teach you more about the genre and give you all of the necessary tools you'll need to be a successful improv actor. There are different levels of improv classes, including a beginner's level, so don't be afraid to join a class.   Even if you end up not pursuing improv, taking a class can be a great way to gain self confidence, improve your communication skills, meet new friends, and spark your other areas of creativity. Improv classes can be found in almost every city, so look online to find a class near you. If you decide that you're serious about pursuing improv, you should consider moving to a city that is known for it's comedy scene. Some of these cities are Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City.Take a free class with a friend. Some theaters offer free classes to help promote their new classes or their upcoming season. Go to classes as often as you can and practice regularly.; , This is also called the 'Don't Deny' rule. This rule means that you should always say yes. If the person you're working with has an idea, build upon what they have created. Do not deny the scenario they have set up, just go with it. Even after you've gotten good at improv, this basic rule should still be followed.   If your scene partner starts the scene by stating that you two are pirates, then you must embrace that you two are pirates. If you deny that you're a pirate, you will discredit your scene partner and cause tension in your scene.  It's a good idea to always start scenes on a positive note. When a scene begins positively, there are many more directions for the scene to go. However, if a scene begins on a negative note, it doesn't have much room to grow. Scenes that start negatively usually result in the characters fighting or dying.   For example, if you start a scene by saying "Nobody likes you at school, they think you're so weird," there isn't much that can be done with that scene besides an argument. However, if you say "Everyone at school thinks you're so weird, but in a cool way," the scene has room for growth. You can talk about how your character is different, what makes it cool, etc. Make positive statements to allow your scene partners to embrace their characters., Collaboration is the key to successful improv; you cannot create a successful improv scene on your own. Everyone that is a part of a scene must work together and support one another, otherwise the scene will not work. Embrace each other's ideas, give everyone a chance to shine, and give each other opportunities to enhance the scene.   Focus on the overall scene as opposed to your role in the scene. If everyone wants what's best for the scene, they'll be more willing to share the spotlight and let each character have their shine.  In improv, it's important that you learn how to work well with others, as you'll be creating scenes and scenarios off of one another. When you're working with a partner, both of you should get the same amount of shine. Don't try to upstage your partner, but don't let them outshine you either. Practice working with others so that you can understand a good balance of give and take when doing improv with a partner., You can learn a great deal from watching both bad and good improv. When you go to improv shows, pay attention to what works well on stage and what doesn't. Pay attention to how the audience responds to certain things. Get ideas about characters and personalities that you can develop for your improv.   Going to local comedy shows will also help people become familiar with you. Immersing yourself in the scene is a great way to meet other improv actors and comedians. Most big cities have at least one improv comedy club, but if you're looking for an amazing local comedy scene, you may want to consider relocating to Chicago, LA, or NYC. Some well known improv comedy clubs include Second City, Acme Comedy Theater, ComedySportz, Brave New Workshop, The Bad Dog Theater Company, and Groundlings, just to name a few., Watching these shows will allow you to study some of the best improv comedians and learn what makes a good improv performer. Study the good and the bad, and apply what you've learned when you practice.   Some good improv and sketch comedy shows to watch are Saturday Night Live (SNL), Whose Line is It Anyway, Wildin' Out, In Living Color, Mad TV, and Chappelle's Show. Keep in mind that most of these performers started on a local level as well. They got better over time, and so will you if you apply yourself., Hang out with the friends that you've met in improv class and watch each other practice. Although it's important for you and your improv friends to work together, it's just as important to watch each other from an outsiders point of view. If you and your friends take turns observing each other, you'll be able to provide feedback from the audience perspective.  The best way to get experience with improv is to perform. Practicing is important, but performing in front of an audience brings another element into the mix. Many improv shows feed off of the audience, so it's important to experience doing improv in front of an audience., As your improv skills progress, you should switch to a more advanced class. This will allow you to work with better improv actors and new instructors, and will also push you to improve your improv chops.   Advanced improv classes often come with other perks, such as workshops with successful actors, discounted or free tickets to professional improv shows, and assistance with head shots and resumes.Head shots are professional photos that actors submit to casting directors when auditioning for roles. Resumes list all of an actors experience and are turned in with their head shots at auditions. When you are ready to start auditioning for different roles, be sure to get your own head shot and resume.  Many improv teachers are known and respected in their local comedy scenes, so it's a good idea to develop your relationship with them. If your teachers see that you're taking improv seriously, they may be willing to introduce you around or set up some auditions for you.   Volunteer often in class to show that you enjoy participating. Attend your teacher's comedy shows outside of class. Ask your teachers what additional things you can do to practice, perform, and immerse yourself in the improv scene.  If you don't have a real audience to perform in front of, gather some friends and family to be your audience. This will be a good way for you to practice in front of an audience and get comfortable doing improv in front of others.   This can be as simple as playing playing a game of charades with a group of loved ones. It will be a fun time and will allow you to exercise your improv and teamwork skills.  We all have families, we all have friends, we all have our own lives. Apply improv in your daily routine. Almost all up-and-coming comedians have to keep day jobs to pay rent, so don't be embarrassed that you have one as well. Many jobs will allow you to practice improv throughout the day, so take advantage of those opportunities.   Teaching people is a great way to improvise. Whether you're teaching students, your children, or your friends, try to teach them something new. Each person learns differently, so you'll have to adapt to them as you teach them. Believe it or not, you can practice your improv skills while working with customers or coworkers. Learning how to interact with your customers and pitch a product is all part of acting and improvising, as is working with difficult coworkers.	Join an improv class. Learn the "Yes, And" rule. Follow the positivity rule. Focus on teamwork. Work with an improv partner. Go to local improv shows to study other performers. Learn from watching improv and sketch comedy on TV. Watch your friends practice improv. Perform in improv shows. Take advanced improv classes. Build good relationships with your improv teachers and fellow students. Perform improv skits in front of your friends or family. Apply your improv skills in your every-day life.
The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.  If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded., Give a gentle clockwise twist when inserting the mouthpiece. When removing the mouthpiece, give a counter-clockwise twist. It should not turn more than about a half of a rotation, if that. Never bang in the mouthpiece.Over time, the twisting will have a threading effect and make the mouthpiece less likely to be stuck.  Always remove the mouthpiece before putting the instrument in its case. Place the instrument in the case properly. Do not put extra items like music or other items in the case where they don’t fit.  Keeping your mouthpiece clean will help ensure that it fits properly and smoothly into your instrument. Wash it carefully with warm water and mild soap, drying it afterwards with a soft cloth. Periodically, apply a little dab of valve or key oil to the insertion end., Dropping a mouthpiece on a hard surface such as tile or concrete is sure to dent or otherwise damage your mouthpiece. Even dropping a mouthpiece on carpet can risk damaging it. If you drop the mouthpiece, inspect it right away to ensure that it is still round. If it’s dented, use a trueing tool to reshape the insertion end.	Regularly inspect the mouthpiece for damage. Use a mouthpiece trueing tool. Carefully insert the mouthpiece into your instrument. Properly store your instrument in its case. Regularly clean your mouthpiece. Don’t drop your mouthpiece on the ground.
Tape is a great way to accent your handlebars and provide a better grip at the same time.   Simply buy a colored tape from any store that sells bike accessories and wrap it flush against the handlebar until the entire surface area is covered. One layer of type will suffice.; , Every bike has a cap that sits atop the headset where the steering portion is bolted together. The headset cap simply covers the bolt and is usually a bland color. You can swap out your current cap for a custom color or design and add flare to an otherwise ordinary bike part. The headset cap comes in different sizes. The surest way to figure out what cap size you have is to consult the manual that came with your bike or consult an employee at a local shop. The installation is simple and the cap should simply screw off and back on.  Bags are a great way to attach extra space to your bike that stores objects like your phone, a water bottle, or anything else you might need. Rather than getting a run of the mill bag, you can get a great design or color to personalize your bike.   You can get a number of different bags depending on your preference. There are trunk bags that sit behind the seat, a handlebar bag that sits up front or some that nestle below the bike frame out of sight. , Decals are a great and simple way to spruce up your bike frame without investing the time or money to paint it. You can get your name, a favorite brand or even more fun ones that represent your interests and hobbies, like your favorite breed of dog!  , There are a lot of different types of bike seats that improve comfort and look great. Changing the material and cushioning of your seat is an easy customization. Gel cushioning. These mold to your body and provide great comfort for a casual rider. Foam cushioning. This is great for long rides and those who weigh over 200 lbs. It’s great for long rides because it provides more support for your lower back but still enough give for comfort. Leather saddles. These are becoming more popular. Although they take some time to break in, it will help keep you cool on long roads and is second to none in terms of durability. This is a great choice for someone who rides a lot.  This can be time consuming and requires a little more work, but a new paint job can make your bike look new.   Make sure to clean your bike well getting off the rust and imperfections from wear and tear. Following this you can buy special primer and paints designed for bikes that turn your old dingy frame into a bright masterpiece.  Maybe you want to change how your bike looks without changing the frame or bike itself. You can buy a lot of neat accessories and apply them to your bike and simply take them off when you tire of them.   Bells and horns. These can be great from a safety standpoint to alert people you’re riding near them, but can also add a unique spin to the front of your bike. Water bottles and cages. Biking is hard and it’s important to stay hydrated. You can add water bottles and holders (cages) to your bike that look great while making sure you stay healthy. Lights. If you like to ride later in the day, it’s important to stay visible. You can get lights that are solar or battery operated that come in different colors and make sure you stand out not only in the dark but also to your friends.  You’ll want to make sure it doesn’t change the performance of the bike too much, but new handlebars can look great. Flat handlebars. These are the most common type of handlebar. They’re simple and light with great control but are not great for those who like to do tricks or high speeds. Riser bars. These are basically flat handlebars that rise from the center clap area and are typically wider than flat bars. They give you great control, are good for your wrists, but can also make your bike less aerodynamic and thus slow it down. Bullhorns. These aren’t great for turning but are otherwise great for high speeds and climbing. They curve up and forward from the center. Drop bars. These have a straight middle section with each end curving downwards and towards the rider. These are a great general handlebar but are not recommended for frequent tight turns.	Apply colored handlebar tape. Swap out your headset cap. Add a unique saddlebag. Buy a decal. Change how you sit. Apply a fresh coat of paint. Add accessories. Change your handlebars.
Cleaning will decrease their value significantly. Avoid cleaning corrosion (such as rust), buildup (such as dirt), and other filth from old coins if you are hoping to sell them for prices anywhere near coin-collecting book values. If the coins you want to clean are part of a numismatic (serious study of coins) collection, do not clean them. Doing so can greatly diminish their coin-collecting values. Leave the cleaning of valuable coinage to experts, who are in the business of this work.; , Any potentially valuable coins should not even be handled with your bare hands. Don gloves, and put the coins in plastic coin envelopes. Get your coins appraised by a professional before you proceed. The same goes for all antiques: don't clean, paint or polish anything that may have value before getting them appraised.  Copper can discolor other coin surfaces when they are left to soak together in a cleaning solution. In terms of American currency: clean pennies separately from nickles, dimes, quarters, etc.   Do not leave copper pennies to soak with steel pennies. The copper could react with the cleaning chemicals and somewhat dissolve in the solution. The dissolved copper will bind to the steel pennies, ruining their finishes.	Don't clean your coins if you plan to sell them, or if they have any potential value. Handle coins with care. Do not clean mostly-copper coins (like pennies) with non-copper coins.
Not all forms of miniature roses will take as cuttings, and unfortunately there is no foolproof list of which can be grown in this manner and which cannot. It depends on the soil, the climate, and the rose in question. So be prepared for some successes and some disappointments -- but do keep trying.; , Do this just after the flower has faded, and be sure that the stem has a minimum of three to four leaves.  Do this by cutting just above the leaf closest to the dead flower.  Remove any excess dead leaves from the stem, ensure that at least three leaves remain on the stem. Dip the cutting in some honey; this helps protect the cutting from rotting, dying, or going moldy.  Gently pat into place and keep well-watered as it strikes. But make sure that the compost is not wet, as over-watering can kill the cutting; keep the cutting in moist compost.	Experiment. Choose a healthy stem from the miniature rose from which you wish to propagate. Remove the dead flower from the top. Make a bottom cut just below a leaf. Plant the cutting in a pre-prepared container already filled with free-draining mix.
Deep tears that expose the substrate under the leather require a "sub patch" to form a strong backing for your repair. A leather repair kit is a convenient way to purchase sub patch material, since it will also include the other tools needed for this repair. If you don't have a repair kit, you can use any strong, flexible mending fabric, or another piece of leather or vinyl. Cut the sub patch so it is slightly larger than the hole or tear. Round the corners for easy insertion.  Use a pair of tweezers to insert the sub patch into the hole, then to flatten out any wrinkles or folds. Make sure that the sub patch completely covers the hole and sits smoothly between the substrate and the leather.  Using a large needle or toothpick, apply a flexible fabric or leather glue to the underside of the leather. Spread the glue in a thin layer wherever the leather will contact the sub patch. Press the leather onto the sub patch, gently pulling the tear back to its original shape. Wipe away excess glue with a paper towel.  Place a block of wood or heavy book over the entire area to apply even, firm pressure. Wait for the glue to dry for at least twenty minutes, or according to label instructions.          Check your glue label to see if it suggests using a hairdryer to speed up drying. Even if it does, keep the heat low and avoid holding the blow dryer directly against the leather. Excess heat can dry out or damage leather.  Before you apply leather filler to repair the hole, you'll need a clean surface for it to bond with. Lightly dampen a clean rag with leather cleaner or 70% isopropyl alcohol, then gently clean the damaged area.          Alcohol is usually more effective than leather cleaner at removing excess glue or grease-based stains., This helps the leather filler create a flush surface with the edges of the tear.Carefully trim away any loose or stringy fibers around the edge of the hole.  If there is still a small gap between the two edges, use a palette knife to spread a small amount of leather filler into the gap. Use the flat side of the palette knife to smooth out the filler and to scrape away any excess.You want to leave the filled area flat and flush with the rest of the leather surface. Use a paper towel to remove any excess filler and feather the edges where it touches the undamaged surface of the leather.          Leather filler is included in leather repair kits.  Refer to your product instructions for an estimate of drying time. Once dried, you should be able to press the repaired area gently without it shifting or feeling squishy.You may have to apply a second coat of filler if the surface still feels uneven after drying.  You can mix your own color by hand following the instructions in your repair kit, or send a sample of the leather to a custom leather dye company to make an exact match. Once you have the right color, dab a small amount of dye over the repair with a damp sponge. Once the area is mostly concealed, wait for it to dry. Repeat as necessary, gradually blending outward for a natural appearance.         Test the mix on an inconspicuous corner of the leather first if you're not confident it's the right shade. If the color seems wrong, wipe it away quickly.  Some leathers have a more lustrous finish than others. If the dye looks too flat and dull, dab a coat of clear finish over the top, and wait until it dries. The clear finish will help protect the color and match the luster.	Cut out a piece of sub patch. Insert the sub patch beneath the hole. Glue the sub patch to the leather.  Weigh down the tear while it dries. Clean the area. Trim away any loose fibers around the edge of the tear. Apply leather filler. Wait for the filler to dry. Dye the repaired area. Apply leather finish.
Lemongrass can be grown from seeds for very little money and with very little supplies, most of which can be found right near your home. The best time to begin growing is mid-February to early March , however, with the right care, you can grow them any time of year.   Stop at a garden store to find a 5 gallon container for every plant you’d like to grow, as well as sterilized seed starting mix, potting soil, and several planting trays with plastic domes - plastic bags also can work as a substitute. Seeds are sometimes harder to find at garden stores, but you can also buy them online at multiple nurseries. If your seeds will not be constantly at least 70 degrees while they are germinating, consider buying a seedling heat mat as well to help nurture your seeds at a constant temperature as they grow. If you wish to speed up the process, you can also purchase a nitrogen organic fertilizer like Alfalfa Meal or Blood Meal.; , At this stage, the seeds are too fragile and vulnerable to go directly into soil, so you need to give them 1-2 weeks in a dark, warm place to sprout by tending to them very carefully. This is easier in a warm environment, but it’s possible to do in a colder place as well.   Put your seed starting mix into your seedling trays, inserting them about ¼ of an inch deep. Place the domes, or your plastic bags, over the seeds so they are covered. If the area around the seeds is cold, place your seedling heat mat beneath the trays. Spritz the seeds with water daily, keeping them moist but not wet, replacing the dome or plastic bag each time. When green seedlings appear from the seeds, remove the dome or bag from the trays and move them into full sunlight.  Seedlings need more room and nutrients in order to grow into stalks, and each will need their own 5 gallon container to do this properly. So when your seedlings are roughly 6 inches long, it’s time to transplant!Fill each of your 5 gallon containers with four gallons of rich, well draining soil. If you purchased fertilizer, mix a ½ cup of this with your soil before filling your container. Move each seedling to its own pot, placing it roughly a ¼ of an inch down into the soil. Water your plants at least 2 or 3 times every week, or a few times more if the weather is over 80 degrees and the soil feels dry like sand.	Purchase all materials. Germinate your seeds. Transplant the seedlings.
To do this, you will need to fit a charging hose on the low pressure port, which is on the refrigerant line on your car, usually near the accumulator. Be sure to use eye protection. If your system is completely discharged, it may be contaminated with moisture, and charging will not give satisfactory results unless the source of the leak is found, repaired, and the receiver dryer is replaced. The open system must be repaired and purged using a vacuum pump to remove air and moisture. You will also want to add compressor oil if the system has been leaking. Evidence of oil leakage and measurement of oil left in a replaced compressor will be a guide as to how much oil to replace.; , If your system has lost sufficient refrigerant to quit working, you have a leak. Small leaks may take months to deplete the refrigerant so that the AC fails to cool, but charging a system with a significant leak is simply a waste of time. Look for refrigerant oil residue on hose, tubing, and fittings that are part of the refrigerant system. Spray a soapy water solution on fittings and watch for bubbles to appear, indicating a leak.  To test a compressor with a low charge you may need to jump the pressure switch, often located on the accumulator.  This is done by completely opening the valve on the tapping fitting, which retracts the tapping pin into the valve body. Failing to do so will result in the tap puncturing the can when it is installed, releasing the refrigerant before the fitting is sealed.  This drives the pin into the top of the can, making it possible to release the refrigerant when the valve is opened.  Open the valve until you hear it fill with refrigerant, then slowly loosen the brass fitting that connects the hose to the valve. Be careful not to allow refrigerant to spray on bare skin, as this will freeze skin tissue on contact. Re-tighten the hose once you have heard refrigerant escaping; this should have forced any air (and moisture) from the hose.  This will be on the larger tube, usually near or on the accumulator. Connect the quick coupling and make sure it is not leaking.  If your recharging hose is equipped with a pressure gauge, check it to determine if the system needs refrigerant. If the pressure holds steady in the recommended range, the system is full and should not be charged. If the pressure is below the recommended range, follow the instructions to recharge the system.   Another indicator that the system needs refrigerant is that the compressor cycles rapidly. If the compressor switches on and off every 5 to 20 seconds, it is most likely due to low pressure. You will see the pressure drop when the compressor kicks on, the compressor will shut off when the pressure gets too low, and the pressure rises back up to the operating range as the system equalizes. Compressor cycling (switching on and off) in a completely charged system should be very slow (every 30 seconds or up) or not at all present (compressor stays on) in hot weather. Be aware if the cooling fans for the radiator are on and functioning with while the AC system is on. If the compressor is on, the cooling fans should also be on to assist in cooling the freon in the condenser, located either in front or behind the radiator. Most vehicles have 2 fans, with one being dedicated to the AC system  ,, This often takes anywhere from two to five minutes. The hotter the outside temperature, the more quickly the contents will discharge. Keep the can with the tap up at all times, to allow non-liquid refrigerant into the suction side of the system to prevent compressor damage. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart.  Check the charging port for leaks, and replace the plastic cap.  It should be blowing cold (38-45 degrees), if not, either one can of refrigerant was not sufficient to charge the system, or some other component is the problem. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart.	Determine if you have any refrigerant left in your system at all. Check for any obvious leaks. Make sure the condensing coils are not obstructed with debris, and that the compressor is operating. Tap your refrigerant can. Securely thread the tapping valve on the refrigerant can, close the valve completely shut. Purge the charging hose. Locate the low pressure charging port on the refrigerant line on your car. Crank your engine and turn the AC on high cool, high fan. Open the valve until you hear refrigerant passing through the hose.  , Allow the can to dispense its contents. Close the valve and disconnect the hose when the can is empty or no longer discharging enough to keep the can cold. Check the air from the AC vents in the car.
There is a wide variety of choices, but not all of them will align with your personal preferences. Some are commercially produced from chemicals, some come from plants, while others are based on essential oils. The origin of the scent may impact your choice to use it, especially if you're concerned about chemicals in your home environment. Typical sources of scenting candles include:   Commercial candle making scents: These are in liquid form and are available from most stores that sell candle making supplies. The strength of the scent will vary from brand to brand and whether or not you have access to a full list of ingredients will depend on the manufacturer's willingness to provide this. Expect to use about 1 ounce of liquid scent to every 2 pounds of melted wax. Fragrance oils: These are 100% synthetic and are not specifically made for candles but usually still work for scenting them. The same issues as the commercial scents apply. Most are highly concentrated, so use of these should be sparing. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of fragrance oil per 1 pound of melted wax. Essential oils: These are produced naturally from plants such as herbs and flowers. They have specific properties, which can be found by doing an online search or using a book on essential oils. Not all essential oils will work well with wax, so you may need to do a test first. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of essential oil per 1 pound of melted wax. Natural sources of scent: This covers such things as crushed or powdered plants, spices and herbs, finely ground zest, etc. Some work really well with melted wax, such as ground cinnamon, crushed lavender flowers or finely ground lemon zest. Others may not meld as well though, or can stop the wax from turning hard or prevent the wick from burning, so do your research first. Expect to use about 1 teaspoon of ground spice, herb or zest per 1 pound of wax.;	Consider the kind of scent you'd like to add to candles.

Make sure the product you buy protects the Vespa from rain or direct sunlight and that it will fit your model. Order the cover. Fit the cover. Keep your Vespa in the garage. Regularly maintain your Vespa.
To make a bamboo flute, you’ll need a drill, a rotary tool such as a Dremel, and attachments for it. You’ll also need a general purpose hand-held sander, masking tape, a saw, a ruler or measuring tape, and a box cutter or sharp knife. You should be able to find all of these items from the hardware store.; , Of course, you’ll need some bamboo as well, and you don’t always have to buy it. Even if it is not a plant that is native to your area, sometimes you can find it growing on the side of the road because these plants tend to take root and flourish almost anywhere. However, if you are unable to find bamboo out in nature, head to your local hardware store and ask around.   Also, look in your local yellow pages. Carpet stores sometimes have bamboo flooring that comes in bamboo rods that you could use., When you’re selecting bamboo, make sure that the diameter is between 3/4 inches and 7/8 inches. However, thin-walled bamboo about 1/8 inch-thick or so produces the best sound. Also, look for a good piece of seasoned bamboo that isn’t cracked. It shouldn’t be really flexible or have any visible cracks, rips, splinters or holes.Make sure that the bamboo has at least one node -- a notch where it is solid inside instead of hollow like the other parts of the bamboo. It’s usually marked by circular ridges that look like joints on the bamboo. One node at the end of the flute will become what is known as the “cork.” The node should be smooth and without holes on the inside or the outside so that the flute has proper tone., Use a hacksaw if necessary. You’ll also want to sand down any notches left behind from where you cut off the bamboo. If you have one, use the hand sander to do this; it’s much faster and easier than sanding by hand.   The piece of bamboo that you selected might have several nodes. If it’s a long piece of bamboo, select the part of the bamboo that you are going to work with and sand down that section so you don’t sand the entire bamboo stem unnecessarily.  The length of the pipe determines the key that it plays. To make a flute that plays in the key of A, cut a 14 inch length of pipe. For an F flute, cut it to 18 inches, and for a key of D cut it to 21 inches. Choose a section of bamboo with joints that are a little bit more than half as far apart as the intended length of the instrument.   For instance, if you want a 14 inch flute, the nodes should be a little more than 7 inches apart from each other. In other words, there should be a little more than 7 inches of tube between each node. The aim is to cut it so that there is a node at the end and another node more or less in the middle. You want the flute to have a node at one end and another more or less in the middle after you cut it to size. It should have at least one. Wrap a piece of masking tape around the area that you want to cut, then cut it with the hacksaw. The tape helps stop the bamboo from splintering. Cut outside of the node. Don’t cut into it.  Choose the part of the bamboo with the node near the end to be your cork. Then, measure 2 cm (0.78 inches) out from the node and mark it with a pencil. This area is will be known as the cork of the flute. The blow hole, which is formally known as the embouchure won’t be placed far from it. Don’t cut into this area.  Because if it has holes in it, then it the flute’s tone might not be proper.  As previously noted, the inner portion of the nodes are solid, not hollow like the rest of the pipe. So, you’ll have to knock out all of the nodes except for the one near the end serving as your cork. You can use a hammer and chisel to do this. Stick the chisel or a sharp tool up against the node inside the tube, then hit the top of the tool with a hammer. You’ll slow chisel it away.   Another option is to burn out the nodes with a hot poker, but the safest option is most likely boring out the nodes with a long drill bit.  Wrap sandpaper around a dowel rod about 20 inches long and tape the sandpaper to it. Then, rub the sandpaper against the inside of the bamboo to smooth the inside of the tube. Also, sand the places where the nodes were located so that it is as smooth as possible.  Now that the bamboo is open, you can see the thickness of the walls, which you’ll need to know to calculate the diameter of the embouchure -- the blow as previously noted. Using your ruler, measure each one to the nearest millimeter and write down your measurements. Then, set them aside for later.  The embouchure should be one diameter up from the cork -- the node you selected at the end of the bamboo. For instance, if the width or diameter of the bamboo is 8 centimeters (3.1 inches), then you will measure 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) up from the cork. Then mark it, and this is where the center of the blow hole will be placed.   The diameter is the length of a circle.  Now, you need to know how wide to make the blow hole because the width of the hole makes a difference with the sound of the flute. Use a flute calculator such as Flutomat to calculate the measurements for you.   Input your measurements of the flute's inner diameter and wall thickness.Then, choose the key you want the flute to be in. If you cut your flute to a specific length for a specific key, you can skip this step if you want. The application will calculate the diameter for the embouchure and the other holes in the seven-note Western scale. Write down the diameters of each hole. For instance, suppose the diameter of the blow hole is 10mm (0.393 inches), then according to the calculator, the diameter of the following finger holes 1-7 might be 8.0 mm(0.3149 inches), 8.5 mm (0.335), 9 mm (0.354 inches), 7 mm (0.275 inches) ,9.5mm (0.374 inches) ,10mm (0.393), 5.5mm (0.217 inches).  Use the flute calculator, which also calculates the space between the edge of each hole and the open end of the flute. It gives the measurements based on each holes distance from the embouchure. So, mark where each hole should be to make sure that they will fit on your pole. Once, all your measurements seem correct and everything seems to fit on the bamboo, then you’re ready to drill.  Use wood clamps to clamp it down. Then, with the embouchure facing up, begin drilling with the 2mm (0.078 inches) drill bit where you made your mark for the first hole. Once you’ve made a small hole with the drill bit, increase to a larger drill bit like 8 mm (0.315 inches) . Steadily increase the size of the drill bit until you get to a bit larger enough to make the size of your holes. For instance, if your embouchure is 10 mm, increase your drill bits in increments until you get to a 10mm drill bit to make the hole that size.   When you’re drilling, hold the bit perpendicular to the bamboo with a steady hand. If you hold the drill at an angle or are unsteady as you drill, you might drill the bamboo improperly or splinter, crack or rip the bamboo. Be deliberate but careful as you drill.  Use a Dremel or a similar rotary tool to make the hole nice and smooth. Put a sanding attachment on the rotary tool. Use one of the attachments that has medium grit sandpaper. (Feel the paper to check. The rougher the sandpaper, the more gritty the sandpaper.) Gently sand the hole with medium grit and then a smoother sandpaper while being careful not to change the shape or size of the hole.  You need to test it to make sure you get a familiar, mellow, "flute-like" tone. If you need to make adjustments, sand the outside edge of the embouchure with a sanding file at a downward slant, but only do this if you think it needs adjustment. If it sounds good to you, it’s better to play it safe and not make any adjustments.  Make sure that they are in the right place respective to the blowhole. The Flutomat calculator gives the space between each hold from the end of one hole to the end of the next hole. So, it doesn’t give you the hole’s center. You’ll need to make your hole one radius up -- half the diameter-- of the hole. This is where the center of the hole will be and where you’ll drill. Then, drill in the same manner that you drilled the blowhole.   Make sure your holes are marked in a straight line. Drill in successively larger bits, which means start with the smaller bits to make a starter hole. Then, slowly increase to the larger bits to get to the size drill bit to make the appropriate size. Some parts of the bamboo and thinner than other such as where a branch was growing. So, be mindful of this when you’re drilling. If you have to drill a hole over a node, this area will be thicker than other areas. Take your time and drill slowly.  With your rotary tool, sand the edges of the hole so that they are smooth. If you are scared of making a mistakes or sanding too much, use the sanding file. They’re also great for smaller holes. Once you’ve cleaned up the drill holes, you’re ready to play.	Gather supplies. Scour for bamboo. Choose a quality bamboo. Remove the branches on the bamboo. Cut the pipe to the length you want based on the key. Select the node that is to become the cork. Check the node that you selected to be your cork again for holes. Knock out the solid nodes. Clean out the inside of the flute. Measure the wall thickness. Measure the exact placement of the embouchure. Calculate the diameter of the embouchure. Measure the length between the finger holes. Clamp the bamboo down and begin to drill the embouchure. Sand the hole. Blow into the embouchure. Recheck your finger hole markings. Clean up the insides of the holes.
Wear a straw hat. Straw hats such as Luffy's are typically available at craft stores. If the rim is too big of floppy, use something sharp (such as an X-Acto knife) to make the rim smaller. Wrap some red ribbon around it. Fasten some cord around it so you can hang it around your neck. Draw a scar under your left eye using a fine tip marker.;	Put together your costume.
Contractors have devised a quick, easy system of determining how much concrete yardage is needed for a given pour. This method doesn't require you to use any volume equations - however, there are two stipulations for its use. First, it only works for rectangular prisms (basic "box-shaped" pours). This method is easiest for relatively shallow pours, but it's possible for all rectangular prisms. Second, it requires that your pour area's length, and width measurements be in feet and that its depth measurement be in inches. To convert any of your measurements to feet, use the conversion factors below:   1 yard = 3 feet 12 inches = 1 foot 1 meter = 3.28 feet 30.48 centimeters = 1 foot  , Square footage (written "sq. ft" or ft2) is a measure of 2-dimensional area typically used to describe floor space. To determine your concrete job's square footage, simply multiply the length and width of the area you're pouring into without taking into account its depth.   For example, let's say we're pouring into a rectangular prism that is 10 ft wide, 5 feet long, and 6 inches (0.5 feet) deep. Its square footage would be 10 × 5 = 50 sq. feet. We don't need to worry about its depth yet. Remember, this method only works for rectangular prisms. In other words, your pour area must have straight vertical edges.  Now that you've found your square footage, all you need to do to find your project's concrete yardage is to divide the square footage by a certain number - the thicker your project, the smaller the number; the thinner your project, the larger the number. Below are coefficients for a few common thicknesses. If your project's thickness isn't listed below, don't worry - you'll learn how to easily figure out your coefficient in the next step.   If your project is 4 inches thick, divide your square footage by 81 to determine your yardage. If your project is 6 inches thick, " " " " " 54. If your project is 8 inches thick, " " " " " 40. If your project is 12 inches (1 foot) thick, " " " " " 27.  If the thickness of your concrete pour doesn't match any of the examples above, you can quickly calculate it by dividing 324 by the thickness of your concrete project (in inches). Then, divide your square footage by your answer to find your project's yardage.   For example, let's say our 50 sq. ft concrete pour is 7 inches deep. We would find our concrete yardage as follows:  324/7 = 46.28 50/46.28 = 1.08 cubic yards.	Ensure your concrete pour is a rectangular prism. Find the square footage of the area you're pouring. Divide your square footage by a numerical coefficient. Determine odd coefficients manually.
Pick two pegs to use. Place one rubber band across two hooks, twisted once to make it a figure 8. Push that towards the bottom of the pegs, and place two more rubber bands on top without twisting them.; , Use your hook to grab one end of the bottom band and pull it over the top of the peg, so that it's looped over the other two bands. Do the same with the other side of the bottom band. Then put a new rubber band on the pegs, again without the twist, so that there are three rubber bands total on the pegs. Twist one band into an infinity shape.  Use the hook to bring both ends of the bottom rubber band over the top of the peg and the two other bands on it. Then add another band to the peg so that you finish each step with three bands on the pegs.   To make an ordinary fishtail bracelet, you would simply continue this step until the bracelet was long enough. For the inverted fishtail, this step is just to make sure all the rubber bands are secure before you begin the trickier inverted pattern.  You should have three bands on the pegs. On one side, slide your hook in between the top two and use it to pull the middle one backwards, away from the pegs and out of the way. With the middle band still pulled back, use your hook to grab the bottom band. Pull the bottom band up through the middle band and then over the top of the top band. Pull it off the peg and leave it sitting on top of the bands stretched between the pegs.  Then make sure to add another band on top, so that you always finish the stitch with three bands.   This stitch is very similar to the regular fishtail. The only difference is that the bottom band comes up inside the middle band and then outside and over the top band, rather than going outside and over both of them.  Use your hook to pull the middle band out of the way. Reach inside and grab the bottom band, then pull it over the peg. Do this on the other side, and then add another rubber band on top.  Depending on the size of your wrist, this can take more than 40 rubber bands.  Finish the way you started, with two regular fishtail stitches. To do this, simply pull the bottom band over the peg on both sides. Add another band and repeat with the new bottom band. You should have two bands left on the pegs.  The two bands that were left on the pegs won't be connected to anything. Holding the ends of the last band that you wove, slide the two loose bands out of the bracelet.  Slide the two looped ends of the last band you wove onto one end of the C/S clip. The other end of the bracelet will have two crossed loops from the first band that you wove; slide these loops onto the other end of the C/S clip to secure your bracelet.	Set up your loom just like for an ordinary fishtail. Begin weaving an ordinary fishtail. Repeat two or three more times. Start the inverted stitch. Repeat the above step with the other side of the band to complete the stitch. Repeat the above steps to create your inverted fishtail bracelet. Continue until the bracelet is long enough. Secure the end of the bracelet. Take the bracelet off the loom, making sure to hold it securely so it doesn't fall apart. Use a C/S clip to secure both ends of the bracelet. Finished.
This method is free, but can take a long time. The idea is to slowly kill the stump by denying its basic needs. Put a dark tarp or trash bag over the stump so it won’t receive sun or water.  During this time, the stump will slowly die. Check it from time to time to see how things are progressing. It should begin to rot and fall apart.   As it dies and rots, you can use stump removal solution to speed the process along. It's available at nurseries and garden centers. You can also add some Epsom salt to cracks that appear in the stump, or see Method One and drill holes in the stump and fill them with salt to make it go faster.  Covering the stump should prevent anything from growing, but until the stump is dead, you can cut saplings off the base of the trunk as they sprout, or paint them with a woody brush killer that contains triclopyr. If your goal is to allow one tree to grow from the old stump, cut off additional saplings do not apply an herbicide.	Cover the stump. Wait three to six months. Cut off any saplings that crop up.
If you are not taking requests the general rule of thumb is to have at bare minimum enough music to play the event, plus an additional hour or two so if certain music is not working well you have enough additional music to fall back on. (NOTE: One Hour = Approx. 12-20 songs).   If you will be taking requests it is important to have enough music to make the odds of you having the requested songs pretty good. One way of doing this is taking the Billboard Annual Top 100 charts for the last 3-5 years and trying to obtain all of the songs listed plus at least one other single from each of the artists.; ,   For example: If you know the dance is a Ho-Down themed event it is important to be well stocked on Country music, if the event is a Valentine's Day dance extra slow songs may be in order, etc. Make sure to bring a variety of musical styles however just in case the crowd becomes tired of a certain genre or you start getting requests for something different.  Many schools will allow a small amount of inappropriate language, others will allow for none.   Search out songs that have (Radio Edit), (Radio Mix), or (Clean) in the song title this will tell you that the inappropriate content has been censored or removed.	Amount of Music : Before you can even begin to play music at a school dance it is important to have a large selection of music prepared ahead of time. Type of Music : When you accept the gig be sure to ask the event coordinator what type of music has been played at these events in the past as you want to ensure you have appropriate music for the venue and the crowd. Radio Edits : Always ask the event coordinator how much tolerance there will be for objectionable language.
Use a sterile, sharp cutting tool to trim only the damaged portions.   Do not cut off any portions of a leaf that are undamaged. Leave undamaged leaves intact, no matter how many other leaves have been damaged. Orchid leaves will blacked due to a range of causes, including bacterial disease, fungal disease, over fertilization, over watering, and exposure to hard water. You can also remove whole leaves that have yellowed and withered, but only if the leaves have weakened so much that you can remove them by lightly pulling on them with your fingers.  When you remove the orchid from its current pot, examine the roots. Look for any unhealthy roots and carefully cut them away with sterile, sharp scissors or clippers.   Unhealthy roots will look brown and feel mushy. Make sure that you only cut away unhealthy roots that are dead and dying. Work carefully to avoid accidentally pruning off healthy roots. To verify that a root is dead, cut off a small piece first. Examine it more closely. If it still looks fresh and white, do not cut any more of that root, since it is still alive. If it looks brown, shriveled, or rotted, continue cutting the rest of that root away.  No matter which portion of the orchid you are pruning—spike, leaf, or root—you should only cut away unproductive or visibly dying portions of the plant. Removing healthy growth can hurt your orchid.   The sole purpose of orchid pruning is to remove unproductive parts of the plant so that the rest of the plant can get a higher concentration of nutrients. Pruning healthy parts of the plant will not improve the way the orchid grows in later seasons. Orchids utilize a process called "trans-location." During this process, dying parts continue feeding healthy parts by moving nutrients. As such, you should avoid pruning any part of the plant until it shows visible signs of death.  Usually, an orchid enters its rest state during the late fall.   An orchid pruned during its growth cycle can go into shock and suffer permanent damage.	Trim blackened leaves.Regularly examine your orchid leaves for black spots or similar signs of damage. Cut off unhealthy roots when re-potting the orchid. Leave healthy growth alone. Only prune during the orchid's rest state.
Haruhi is always studying. See How to Get Straight "A"s. She has a lot of common sense. Try to study and work hard in school, be sensible and do what you think is the right thing. But Haruhi works hard in other things besides school, like housework. Try to work hard in both areas.; , This and hard work go hand-in-hand in Haruhi's personality--she is the kind of girl who does things for herself. You can try to get things done by yourself such as cleaning your bedroom, doing your homework, cooking, or cleaning. This will show responsibility and independence.  Haruhi can easily understand how somebody feels. By not being rich, Haruhi is more down to earth than the other members of the Host Club. You can try to be more understanding by listening to others, try to picture yourself in their shoes, understanding situations, and seeing how somebody is feeling.  Haruhi is very informed, and she sometimes looks down on Tamaki, who is not. Don't rely on watered-down soundbites from 24 hour news channels and Comedy Central as your source of information on what's happening in the world.   Haruhi isn't materialistic. She's really not girly in any way, she tries to save her money any way she can, like getting freebies from the store. Work hard for your money and save it. Haruhi is more mature than other girls her age, mostly because her mother died when she was young. Haruhi had to grow up faster and be more independent. Try to be more mature.  Pick up the clothes on your floor. Wash your dishes after using. Don't reuse the week old socks. Walk the dog. Feed the dog. Study. Get a job. Look for ways to show that you're responsible.  If Haruhi's voice was too high pitched, then she would have been immediately been recognized as a girl. If it was too deep, she might not ever been discovered as not being a boy. Meaning: you can't sound too high pitched or too deep. Test your voice change. If it sounds like a girl's, then make it deeper, but if it sounds like a boy's, make it higher. Practice and soon you'll get the hang of it. (optional) You should be completely flat. A sports bra may work if you are very small, but for anyone over an AA it won't work. You will need some sort of binder. If you are about an A or a very small B you can use Under Armour, which is intended for men who are athletes. You should be able to find their compression vests in a sports store. For anyone above that, you'll need a binder. Underworks, Mango and T-Kingdom make these.  (optional) Try using hoodies, vests and button down shirts.  Haruhi is more of a tomboy than a girly-girl. Although Haruhi mostly wears mens clothing, she can wear girls clothes around people who know her true gender. Try purchasing baggy clothes that don't show off your figure too much. For example; baggy jeans or cargo pants/shorts, a long sleeve white t-shirt and sneakers. Don't wear make-up and make sure any hair accessories you wear are pretty plain-looking.  Preferably in shades of grey, blue, black and red.  What other people think of you is not anything to be extremely concerned about. Many people may assume that constantly worrying over others' opinions on themselves and trying to make everyone like them more is the key to seeming superior, but it is not. You do not want that image.  One thing Haruhi is really good at is complimenting other girls. Now Haruhi actually looked like a boy, so don't flirt, just compliment. Don't feel pressure to say something because some girls are just plain mean. If you're friends with her or don't know her, then she's a pretty good candidate.	Be smart. Be independent. Try to be understanding. Read up on current issues and events in the newspaper and other legitimate sources. Try to be more responsible. Make your voice sound neutral. Compress your breasts. Disguise any breasts that show despite the binding. Wear baggy clothes. Start shopping around and get clothes that are either unisex or follow the new trends; for example: get straight leg pants, button downs,cardigans but nothing too girly. Try to not worry about others' opinions too much. Be good at complimenting girls.
Comb through your hair to remove any knots or tangles. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat, even center part, going from your forehead to the nape of your neck.This method works best on hair that's shoulder length.  Gather all your hair on the left side of the part into a high pigtail. Position it about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above your ear and secure it with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Do the same thing for the right side of your head.Make sure that the hair going into each pigtail is smooth and neat.  Find a pair of clean socks that match your hair color. Cut the toes off, then roll each sock from top-to-bottom to form a doughnut shape.The socks need to be long enough to cover your ankle, otherwise your buns will turn out too small.  Pull the entire pigtail through the sock bun first, then bring the bun towards the end of the pigtail. Set the other sock bun off to the side for now., Try to spread the hair as evenly as possible. Tuck them under the sock bun so that they are nestled between the bun and the body of the pigtail., This step can be tricky, and it may take you a few tries before you get the hang of it. Place your thumbs on the top edges of the sock bun, and your fingers on the bottom edges. Push inward with your fingers and pull outward with your thumbs. This will cause the bun to roll down a notch. Keep going until the bun reaches the hair tie., Plan on using a bobby pin on the top, bottom, and both sides of the sock bun. Use more, if necessary., Check yourself in the mirror to ensure that both buns are the same size and at the same height. Make any adjustments, if needed., Now you are ready to rebel against the Empire and save the galaxy.	Brush and part your hair down the middle. Tie your hair into two high pigtails. Create a set of sock buns. Slip a pigtail through one of the sock buns. Spread the ends of your hair around the top of the sock bun. Use both hands to roll the sock bun towards the base of the pigtail. Secure the sock bun to your head with bobby pins that match your hair color. Repeat the whole process for the other side's sock bun. Spray the buns lightly with hairspray.
Some people are uncomfortable with touch because of personality, family history, intimacy issues or trauma. This can make it difficult to initiate or enjoy displays of physical affection, such as caressing, hugging, holding hands or cuddling.Deal with your fears regarding intimacy and connecting physically with another person. Accept that you are afraid, and find out where it’s coming from. It can be helpful to realize that your fears are probably not related to your current partner or events, and to try to move past them.Talk to your partner and let them know that you are uncomfortable and why. Ask him or her to be patient. Showing physical affection can be easier as you get to know someone better and deal with the root causes of your discomfort with physical intimacy. Plus, improving communication may lead to a closer and more affectionate relationship. Talk to a professional about it. They can help you deal with the negative emotions related to your fears and get over your hesitation to show physical affection. If you don’t want to talk to someone, you can write about it in a journal or express your feelings in other ways. Make showing physical affection a habit. Hold your partner’s hand, touch their shoulder or give them a hug as often as possible. Eventually, showing affection physically will come easier and more natural.; , Touching helps relieve stress and pain, can help people cope and strengthen bonds.Put cuddle time on your daily schedule with your family to promote physical and psychological health. Date night, story time and even TV watching time can all be combined with cuddling.  Whether it is with your partner or your kids, holding hands is quick, painless and can really cement your bond. In fact, it is probably one of the easiest ways to immediately increase the amount of physical affection you show for another person. Whether you are walking to the bus stop, through grocery isles or sitting at home on the couch, reach over and take someone’s hand that you care about.  Having contact with your kids and partner can release oxytocin, the cuddle hormone, which lowers blood pressure. It can also help you control the stress hormone cortisol.Physical touch activates the orbitofrontal cortex in the brain, which contributes to rewarding feelings and can even boost the immune system., Physical affection is any touch that is meant to boost affectionate feelings or love in the giver or receiver.Write down your list so you can refer to it later. Then, make it a goal to do each method at various points throughout the week.   Some ways that you can show affection include: kissing, back rubs, massages, caressing, cuddling, holding, hugging and holding hands. There may be other methods specific to you or your relationship that can also relay feelings of love. Although it may take 21 days to form a habit, the time length depends upon the person. Continue referencing this list for several months to permanently change how much physical affection you show.  Finding humor with your partner can be enhanced by good-natured physical contact. This may be a gentle squeeze, shoulder or knee nudge, playful slap, knuckle nudge or soft push. Always be sure that your partner doesn’t mind when you nudge them and never hit hard, cause pain or leave bruises., You can wrap your legs and feet together, play footsie under the table, put your feet in your partner’s lap or vice versa. This connects you physically and keeps you aware of each other’s presence if you are sitting directly across from him or her. Remember, any physical contact that is intended to convey affectionate feelings is a form of physical affection.  Along with other forms of physical affection, giving massages can help bring you closer in your relationship. Additionally, massages have health benefits including: reducing stress, increased blood and nutrient flow and helping with pain. For all these reasons, a back, foot or body massage is a great way to show physical affection. Your partner will probably enjoy it and hopefully return the favor.	Recognize discomfort. Schedule cuddle time with kids or spouses. Hold hands. Include physical touch in your list of health goals. List healthy ways that you can be physically affectionate. Give playful nudges. Put your feet together. Try a massage.
If you have misplaced hard copy tickets that you purchased by phone or online, you have to deal with Ticketmaster directly. The easiest way to get in touch with them about the tickets is to call their fan support line at 800-653-8000.You can also email Ticketmaster fan support through their Contact Us page at , but it can take up to 12 hours for them to get back to you.

Be as thorough as possible when recording details about the piano. What company produced it? How old is it? What is it made of? Are there any flaws or faults potential buyers should be aware of? The more details you can provide, the better the odds you’ll find a suitable buyer match.; , Once you have established the condition of your piano, you can narrow your search in order to find comparable items either online, in local newspapers, or in buy-and-sell publications. Pianos for sale aren’t always easy to find, but with enough digging, you should be able to come up with a rough idea of your item’s worth.  Be sure to keep a few things in mind:    Brief is best. Only include details relevant to the advertisement. Longer ads lose people’s interest, so keep it short and to the point.  Take a photo. Classified ads and buy-and-sell magazines generally don’t include photos with their ads, but most online sites do. Having a photo of the piano gives prospective buyers a look at exactly what they’re buying, rather than having to rely exclusively on the text in the ad.  Include detailed contact information. Most people have a preferred mode of contact. Enclose a phone number and email address so that interested parties have more than one option.  Flexibility helps. If you’re willing to barter, you’ll likely draw more interest. Include your willingness to accept someone’s “Best Offer” when creating your listing so the buyer knows you’re amenable to negotiating.	Inspect the piano and make notes. Research local or online classifieds and auction sites for price comparisons. Write the ad.
The LoJack radio signal requires special computer equipment for tracking; not all police departments are equipped to track the LoJack radio signal. A list of counties within states where LoJack coverage is available is available by calling 1-800-456-5225 (1-800-4-LoJack).   The telephone list is usually more current than the list on the website.; , LoJack makes different systems for cars built before 1985 (classic cars) than for cars made after that year. The difference in the units is that the classic car version is self-contained and does not require connection to the vehicle's battery to work.   The LoJack version for cars made after 1985 does include a battery back-up to permit it to work if it is somehow disconnected from the battery.  The basic LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System is the wireless radio transponder described above, which LoJack's certified technicians install somewhere in your vehicle. For an additional fee, LoJack offers an Early Warning Recovery System that includes a key pass you carry with you when driving and notifies you by phone, cell phone, e-mail, text message, or pager if your car has been moved without your permission. (You choose which methods you want to be contacted by when you register your LoJack.)   LoJack makes it a practice not to disclose where in the vehicle the LoJack unit is installed, not even to the vehicle owner. Although you can witness the installation, your recovery warranty may be voided if you do.  You can contact LoJack either online or by telephone, and you can arrange to have a technician install your LoJack unit at your home or office.   You can contact LoJack online through its dealer locator and choosing the option "I already own my vehicle or equipment."

Do you want her dirty blonde and black look, or her platinum blonde look?; , Avril is always seen with long hair. If you have long hair, keep it a few inches above your waist, with very few layers at the bottom of your hair. If you have short hair, grow it out long.  If you're going for the black and dirty blonde look, separate your hair into two parts; top and bottom. Dye the bottom part black and the top part almost a dirty blonde. For the platinum blonde look, dye your whole head platinum blonde, except for the front where you can put pink and green in it. If you wanted to be a little different, instead of dying it pink and green, dye the hair your two favorite colors.  Don't copy Avril's hair to a tee, make it your own. If your want to get some funky layers, or different highlights, do by all means.	Decide which Avril look you're going for. Whichever look you're going for, get long hair. Dye your hair. Be unique.
A steady blast of water should knock the aphids off your plants. Continue spraying the plants each day until the aphids no longer return.  Most horticultural oils are actually mineral oils, refined to remove impurities. Many vegetable oils also work well, especially cottonseed and soybean oils.  Use the same types of oil you might use for dormant oil.  Mix crushed garlic and water together, allowing the water to become infused with the scent of garlic. This smell acts as a deterrent against aphids, driving them away.  Mix 1 cup of vegetable or white mineral oil with 2 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of bleach-free dish soap. Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spritz it on infected plants to suffocate the aphids. However, do keep the treated plants out of direct sunlight, since the spray could magnify the light and burn the leaves.  These products cause the aphids' cell membranes to weaken and collapse, ultimately dehydrating them through fluid loss. Sprinkle insecticide powders or spray soaps onto both sides of each leaf on the infected plant.  Pyrethrins are made from the chrysanthemum, while pyrethroids are their synthetic counter-part. Both products are organic, and both are capable of killing off aphids.	Wash aphids off your plants with a standard garden hose. Spray your plants with dormant oil to destroy over-wintering eggs on your plants. Spray your plants with summer oil once you notice an aphid infestation. Use a homemade garlic spray on aphids. Create a home remedy to protect your plants against aphids. Purchase an organic insecticide or insecticidal soap. Try pyrethrins or pyrethroids.
; , First, you must come up with an idea for the movie. Then, you must figure out a way to interpret that idea into a plot that doesn't require any jumping to certain periods in time. Make sure there are absolutely no plot holes.  It's like dancing, but with lines.  They must be very good actors, too. It's very hard to pretend to be scared for almost and hour and a half. It can be very taxing on their emotions and psyche. Give them the script you've written, and then comes the rehearsal.  Rehearsing is definitely something you're going to need to do. Make sure you've rehearsed until everyone knows what to do, what to say, and when to do or say anything. But don't burn these people out! Maybe rehearse about 4 times a day if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Then they can go home. But don't rehearse all day! People will get very frustrated and tired, and that's when their acting becomes very dull and boring.  If not, use a Steadicam, or some other camera stabilizing system. Using a Steadicam takes a lot of practice, so make sure you spend a lot of time prior to making the movie. But not just any camera will do! Make sure it's a very fluid camera, so audiences won't suspect any hidden cuts, even if there are. At least 50 fps (frames per second) is good. HD will be a good thing to use. But, you don't have to make the movie traditional. You can go with found footage, or maybe even strap some cameras to each actor's heads so you can see from each and every point of view in a split screen, like the movie Timecode. Or like Vantage Point.  If you shoot the lights off and use nothing but head-mounted cameras and flashlights, the movie will be scary! Or, you could open a few unseen windows (like skylights, for example) for a cool-colored theme. Or let in as much sun as possible to get a warm feeling.  For instance, replace your windows with sugar glass, breakaway glass, or tempered stunt glass so if anyone goes though a window, the glass will (easily) break into very small pebbles, instead of shards that could cut someone like a normal window! Make sure the window is very close to the ground, and that the actor is on a harness pulled by people off screen. You can get stunt glass pretty much anywhere on the Internet or in special stores. If you're going to be doing any other stunts, like smashing someone into a wall, or a bunch of cabinets, make sure the material breaks easily and doesn't hurt in any way! And make the actor give subtle signs that s/he's okay. Always replace items in your house with breakable look-alikes. Put your own possessions in storage somewhere safe.  Drink lots of tea, or warm beverages. No milk/dairy. Dairy coats your vocal cords and makes it hard to scream/sing/yell. Always push from your stomach, not your throat.  Not too cliché, but not too confusing. If there was no twist, there would be no climax, and ultimately no plot. Any climax without a twist becomes very, very boring.  It's a lot of fun to see the end result!  , If you're looking to make money off of it, sell the movie to studio like MGM, Paramount, etc. If the whole movie was just for fun, YouTube is just fine for something like that.  But, if you're lazy and want the film to only look like one take, while still being divided into scenes, you might have to do some very clever editing. Most professional video editors cost from $100-$300.	Go door to door and tell them when the movie will be shot, so if they hear screaming or see flashlights, it's just you. Planning is the key to everything. Figure out a way to choreograph the camera and actors so they know when and where to go at any given points. Gather your actors. Rehearse. If you're going for a found-footage type movie, then use a freehand camera. Lighting sets the mood. If there are going to be any stunts, take extra safety cautions!, Teach the actors to scream without hurting themselves. Give the plot a good twist to surprise the audience. When the movie is finished, and you've cleaned everything up, have a viewing party!, Distribute the film. If the movie is truly in one take, you won't have to do any editing other than the credits. Finished.
See if it's anything you'd like. Try out music genres like dubstep, dance, pop, rap, and so on.; , Listen to specific artists. Some artists, like I Fight Dragons or Owl City, are inspired by video games.  Try listening to video game soundtracks. They can range from soft, melodic tunes to hard rock and roll. Good starting suggestions would be soundtracks from games like Metal Gear Solid, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Kingdom Hearts.  Even fan music. YouTubers like Smooth McGroove, JT Machinima, The Warp Zone, and The Screen Team make great examples of geeky music.  Try out themes of animes (or any TV show, really). Listen to parodies, or even write your own!	Be aware that geeky music doesn't necessarily have a single genre, although they are typically rock or anything techno. Get familiar with a genre (or several). Look on YouTube for what you want. Look for artists who make video game music. As you get accustomed to geeky music, try expanding your tastes.
It's no fun when you go to someone's house, and all they have is really hard pillows, but they look super-cute... yeah, it takes away the cuteness. Go to a fabric store, or collect some old (but not too old) shirts, blankets, bags, or anything that's soft and stylish.; , Usually 1 and a half feet is really good(make sure it's even on all four sides). Note that the size you cut, will not be the size of the finished product (it will be smaller).  Cut slits 6 inches (15.2 cm) into both fabric pieces (towards the middle) about one inch apart, all the way around.  Please DO NOT DO THIS ALL THE WAY AROUND YET! Leave one side un-tied.  Continue tying the fringe until you reach the place where you started. You now have your throw pillow!	First, you are going to want something soft. Measure out the size of fabric. Lay the two pieces of fabric so that the color/design/patterns are facing the outside(like how you imagine the pillow to look like). Tie double-knots with the bottom & top sections of each strip so that you end up with a fringe around the pillow. Stuff the pillow with stuffing, or scrap pieces of fabric.
You'll want to choose colors with projects in mind. Polymer clay blends very well, so keep in mind that you can mix colors.   There are several different brands of polymer clay available. You may wish to purchase more than one brand to see which one you like best. Some are softer than others. Remember, however, that different brands may have different baking directions, so you may not want to mix them together. You can also make your own polymer clay at home.  You will need to plan what type of pendants you want to make. For a necklace pendant or several hanging earrings, you will need to purchase an oven-proof band holder. This is basically a piece of wire that you can stick into the clay before it is baked that is made to withstand the heat of the oven. This wire will have a loop the sticks out of the pendant, that way you can attach the pendant to a necklace string or chain or to earring wires.   You can find a wide variety of jewelry making tools and accessories at any craft store.  Pick your favorite colors and blend them together just enough so that they create a marbled effect.          You can also mix colors together completely in order to make a brand new color. It might be fun to only buy red, yellow, and blue polymer clay and try to make other colors yourself by mixing them together.  Using your fingers alone you can sculpt pendants, figurines, or beads. Begin with simple shapes, adding small pieces of clay on top of that to create a pattern.   Make unique shapes. There are no limits to what you can do with polymer clay. Try to make an abstract shape out of a variety of colors or a tiny version of your favorite animal. The options are endless on what you can make. Try covering a square or circle of polymer clay with small dots of other colors of polymer clay. Once covered, smooth out the surface gently or leave it with a textured surface. If you run out of ideas, try looking online for inspiration. There are a wide variety of websites that can give you ideas to start from.  There are some accessories that need to be baked into the piece. Be sure anything you put in the oven is oven-proof.  This protects both the pan and the back of the jewelry pieces.  Most clays are baked at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.  You can lightly sand with extra fine paper if needed. If you are making a necklace, thread your necklace string or chain through the wire loop on your pendant. If you are making a pair of earrings, simply attach the earring wires you purchased to the loops coming out of the pendants.	Purchase several different colors of polymer clay. Choose some jewelry making accessories. Mix and blend colors. Sculpt your polymer clay. Add metal accessory pieces to your sculpted items before baking. Place your sculpted items on a foil covered cookie sheet. Bake the polymer clay items according to the package directions. Allow sculpted items to cool completely.
Follow the instructions provided with your sewing machine to change out the presser foot, replacing the standard one with a special rolled hem presser foot.   Choose your rolled hem presser foot carefully if you do not already own one. The best and most versatile kind will allow you to make rolled hems using a straight stitch, zig zag stitch, or decorative stitch. For this project alone, however, you only need one that will allow you to make a standard straight stitch.  Sew a line of standard stitches 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) long, 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the raw edge.   Leave long tails of thread after stitching this line. Both the line of stitches and the attached threads will help you guide the fabric into the presser foot. Do not fold your fabric in yet during this step. Stitch along the wrong side of the material.  Note the guide along the front of your special presser foot. Feed the edge of your material into this guide, bending the raw edge over from one side and under the opposite side.   Keep the presser foot lifted as you feed the material in, then lower the presser foot when finished. Feeding the material into the presser foot can be difficult. Use the threads attached to your small set of basting stitches to help lift, guide, and maneuver the edge into the presser foot.  With the edge guided into the presser foot and the presser foot lowered onto the fabric, sew slowly and carefully along the entire edge of the chiffon, stopping only once you reach the end.   If the edge has been fed into the presser foot guide correctly, the presser foot should continue to roll it under as you work. No further effort on your part should be required. Using your right hand, hold the remaining raw edge taut as you sew, allowing it to feed into the presser foot evenly. Work slowly and carefully to prevent bubbles or bumps from forming. When finished, your hemmed edge should be smooth. Do not back tack the material in place. Instead, leave a long tail of thread at the start and end of the seam and knot the thread in place by hand. You will only see one line of stitching from both the front and back of the material.  Once your hem is finished, take the chiffon to an iron and gently press it down, flattening the fold as much as possible.   This step should complete the process.	Attach a rolled hem presser foot to your machine. Sew a small line of basting stitches.Lower the presser foot onto the material without feeding the material into the guide. Feed the edge of the material into the presser foot. Sew along the hem. Press in place.
Having something to munch on will make the time go by faster.; , Have a small laugh to yourself if you find it funny enough. However, if you laugh too loud, the person next to you may find that you are mentally unsound.  Maybe the actors have done something that your relatives have done too.  What things do you have in common? Have you gone through some of the same things as them or been in their position? Catch the reactions of the other actors on what the actor who resembled you had done. Perhaps, you could learn something to make yourself a better person.  See if you can spot product placement advertising or other brand names featured in the movie. Often most of them can be tad obvious to the audience; trigger your laughing bag if you find it awkward!  , See how long you can hold your breath. Use your watch to time yourself or just count in your mind. Again, if you violate the serenity of the theatre, people may find you brain sick.  You might want to use your hands to do the counting because the dull movie may cause you to lose count if you reckon the number mentally.  Start mentally changing what the actors are saying; for example pretend they end all their sentences with the words, "for booze." You can even stop paying attention to their real words and make up a whole new, more interesting conversation for them to have. It sounds immature, but can be incredibly hilarious in the right movie. Just try not to laugh too loud.  Try to make yourself laugh (quietly)!  , See if you can determine where specific sounds are coming from inside the theater. Move your eyes and tilt your head slightly towards the direction of the sound. People around you who thought that the movie was uninteresting may laugh to that!  , Also known as a cue mark, it appears very briefly in the upper right hand corner of the screen about every 20 minutes. It's a cue mark that tells the projectionist when to change a reel., Recite the alphabet backwards or count backward from 200 by sevens. Other similar mental exercises will help you pass the time.  This is especially fun if you choose incongruous names, for example: if you see a character who looks like your high school math teacher, name him Montel (which means "chubby" in Malay language). Try not to laugh out loud.  Did someone just fall out of a plane and live? Come on, filmmakers. Again, try not to laugh out loud., Doing some "good deeds" may help you avoid having to watch another boring movie in the future.	Buy some snacks and drinks. Try to spot flaws in the editing or other mistakes (known in the film industry as "continuity errors."), Imagine that the actors resemble among people you know, such as co-workers, teachers, friends, or relatives. Make connections between the characters and you. Spot advertisements. Take a breather and test your wits. Count the number of times someone in the audience coughs or sneezes. Warp the script. Make a mental list of worse things that you could do: working on a road crew, cleaning a toilet, lying on shards of glass, getting shot at in Iraq, watch this movie again etc. Pay attention to the surround sound effects. Watch out for the small circle icon. Exercise your mind. Name every character in the movie. Look out for implausible things that are happening in the movie. Clean up your own trash when the film is over.
If your Breyers are knocked down, stand them up. It's just so your movie can look better. Make your barn look more realistic!; , If you have a wide selection of horses, use common colors like a liver chestnut horse, that is, a very common color in horses. You can even use a lot of different modes. Like when the liver chestnut is young, when it's older, and during its middle life. Like middle age. But what if you do not have a wide selection of Breyers? Well, find a horse you like commonly in your collection. Like a black horse. And then age but not as many stages. You can start with a foal stage, and then have him or her grow up. Or make it stay one age the whole movie.  Here's a good example. Start out with the action. Showing hooves is a good way to show action. Show a close up of what's holding the action, or causing it. Then, show a close up of the actual horse and the details. Pan from most of the middle face, down a little bit to the nose, and that's where the action starts. You should mostly show the action. And if you make a Breyer horse struggling in its stable, then you might want to consider starting with the hooves and then panning up. In that case, it makes the horse look larger. Which makes the action seem more aggressive. Or hyper. The other thing to do is start where the action originates, in cast the nose where he's being tied up. To show his face to show his expression and his eyes. You can also put some voicing. You can make them talking, whatever you want. Here's an example: "Why did they capture me? I should have ran away, what should I do now?" Remember, if you are showing action like that, make sure you pan upwards to make it more hyper and aggressive. Also, pan from the nose to the eyes.  A human trait would be, when the person or horse is talking, you should make it look at the person or horse in the eyes. This trait invites people more into the story.  It's hopefully doing all three at once. There are a lot of examples of this. But Afleet Alex and Red Rum is not one of those models. They are either walking or trotting. So, he's not a good model to be in a race, he could be standing in a stall though. Those horses can be anything though. The model called Snowman, can be anything. If you have him, look at him. He may be running, he could trotting, and he could also be standing in a stall. Snowman is the perfect model for any movie. There are a lot of other horses like these, but you have to look and see if that model is doing all three gaits. Ruffian is good, but is a really bad example of a horse that has all three gaits. See, she could never ever be standing in a stall. And if you notice, if you try to ever fit her into one, her back legs will get scratched. Ruffian is a great model for racing videos, and stuff like that, she could never be standing in a stall. Don't use her as a main character. But she could definitely be in a movie. Instead, you can use a model that looks like her. If you notice, Ruffian and Flash look the same, but he is a lot smaller than Ruffian and could fit into a stall better. He almost has all three gaits down. He would be a good model in addition to Ruffian. She could be in a run and Flash could be just in a canter.  There are two ways on how to do the script. You can type it up and look at it as you go. The other way to do it is you can make up what's going on. It's quick thinking, but that's the best way to do it.  Carpet is the hardest thing for Breyer horses to stand on. Models lean over and fall down. Which is a very bad thing to happen when you are in the middle of making a movie. You can make a movie in a hallway or a kitchen, where the floor is not flush like carpet. Sometimes there's hard pack carpet. But it's easier on hard wood floors or dirt if your making the movie outside.  You know how to create a Breyer movie!	Clean your Breyer set. Choose your horse main character. Use camera angles!, When a horse is talking, there's something really important to do, is to add a human trait. Pick a Breyer model that is not just running, walking, trotting, or just standing. Prepare your script. Pick a good kind of floor. Congratulations!
Living in an RV can be very different from living in a conventional home, so to make the experience a success, you need to make sure that you have a good reason to stay committed to it. There are no definite “right” or “wrong” reasons, though, so a reason that seems solid to you will usually be enough.   Retirees and individuals who frequently relocate due to their jobs are among those who usually choose to live in an RV full-time. That being said, if you want to live a simpler life or long to travel across country, this can be a good life choice for you, too.; , Even though living in an RV evokes a sense of freedom, the truth of the matter is that you'll be living in very close quarters with your family members and spending many, many hours with them. If anyone opposes the lifestyle, the divide will create unwanted and inescapable tension in your everyday life.   If you have kids under the age of 18, make sure that your kids agree to the idea along with your spouse. The entire family should also prepare to undertake the challenge of homeschooling.  If you've never spent a prolonged period of time in an RV, it's a good idea to try before you buy. Rent or borrow and RV and try vacationing in it for one week to one month. Doing so should give you a better idea of what long-term RV life might be like.Even if you have experience driving or hauling large trailers, you need to have the experience of actually living in an RV. Get a good idea of what it's like to drive the vehicle, organize and schedule your drives, budget for life on the road, and live day-to-day with only the necessities.  In many cases, you won't need a special driver's license to drive or haul an RV, but there are some exceptions. Research the licensing laws in the state of your permanent address and fulfill those requirements before you make any other preparations.   Check with the state DMV to determine the legal requirements. Some notably large motorhomes may require you to obtain a different license for a different vehicle class, but you shouldn't need a commercial driver's license since an RV is a personal vehicle., Life is unpredictable, and there are numerous things that could go wrong and prevent you from continuing RV life for prolonged periods of time. Have an alternate way of living planned out in case of an emergency.If your RV breaks down or if you develop medical problems that prevent you from traveling, you will need to figure out where to stay and how to pay for the associated costs. Make sure that you have adequate insurance for your RV and for your own health. Try to keep a savings account that will allow you to live for one full year without your RV. If possible, work things out with relatives or friends so that you can stay with them for one or two months in case of an emergency.  Generally speaking, there are three main RV types used for full-time living: travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motorhomes. The best choice will depend on what you want and what you can afford.Travel trailers are bumper-pulled campers. They're the cheapest option, but also the smallest. Fifth wheels are larger RVs that you can hitch to the bed of a truck. They're larger than travel trailers and less costly than motorhomes, but you'll still need a separate truck to tow it. Motorhomes are the most expensive and most convenient option. They offer more storage space, and you can drive the motorhome directly instead of hitching it to another vehicle.  Some RVs are not approved for full-time use, so if they break down, the cost of repairs may fall outside of any warranty you have for the vehicle. Read all the fine print before you finalize the purchase to avoid any unpleasant surprises.  Simple put, you won't be able to have as many possessions in an RV as you can have in a conventional home. Plan on getting rid of anything you don't need or putting it away into storage.   Sort through your belongings and take only what you need rather than clinging to what you want. If you aren't able to give up your unnecessary belongings, this probably isn't the right lifestyle for you. Getting rid of your excess stuff is usually the best option. Sell as much as you can for the excess money, then donate or discard anything else. For things of personal value (heirlooms, keepsakes, photographs), consider giving them to other family members or keeping them in storage. You'll need to factor storage fees into your monthly budget if you rent space, though. If you plan on keeping your fixed home or apartment, you can always keep the excess stuff there. This is the most expensive option, but it might be wise if you think there's a chance you'll change your mind about living in an RV.  You don't need to maintain a fixed apartment or house, but you do need to have some type of permanent address for the sake of taxes and other legal purposes.   All states require proof of residency before you can obtain and maintain a driver's license from that state. You'll also need an address to open a bank account and maintain utility accounts. In many cases, having a post office box many not be enough, and you may need an actual permanent address. If you cannot afford to maintain a fixed apartment or house, consider using the address of adult children or other family members (with their permission, of course). Some mail forwarding services will also give you the necessary street address to fulfill these needs.  Each mail forwarding company can be somewhat different, but in general, these services will collect your mail and forward it to you depending on where you're scheduled to be.   Research different companies and service plans. Prices start as low as $9 per month but can vary depending on complexity, so pick one that fits with your budget and your needs. Depending on the service, you might have the option of classifying mail into separate categories, including: forward, scan, trash, or hold. You can also choose the frequency with which mail gets shipped to your location. Some services will also come with a physical street address that you can use for the shipment of packages and legal purposes.  For important mail, consider going paperless and relying on Internet-based billing and banking. Doing so will prevent your bills from getting lost in the mail and reduce the risk of incurring late payment fees.  Nowadays, many RV parks do offer some form of WiFi service, but you shouldn't rely on that service to stay connected to the outside world. Invest in a reliable cell phone plan and a mobile WiFi system—commonly called MiFi—to maintain a more consistent connection.   Since WiFi at campgrounds and other free access points can be unreliable, investing in a MiFi system will be your best option if you need consistent access to the Internet. Shop around for the best cell phone plan, too. While there are many factors to consider, one of the most important points to look at is coverage reliability. You'll need a plan that covers a wide range of locations across the country.  RV life isn't free, so you'll need to know where your money will come from while you're living on the road. In many cases, you may need to supplement any savings or savings plans with flexible employment.   Jobs that allow you to work online or on a freelance basis are often the most suited for this lifestyle, but you can also consider alternative forms of income like craft fairs and bartering. Check around with others who live the RV lifestyle and determine what your options are. There are also online services dedicated to pairing employers with traveling workers.  It's a good idea to estimate your expenses before venturing out and stick to a budget after you've begun. To determine your average monthly expenses, calculate what you currently spend each month, subtract the cost of living in a fixed home, and add the cost of living in an RV.While costs vary, expect to spend between $1,500 and $3,000 per month while living in an RV. Costs you won't need to worry about include property taxes, mortgages, rent, and certain utilities. Extra costs you will need to include include the cost of the RV itself, the RV insurance, and certain camping costs. Your daily living costs will remain fairly consistent. This includes the cost of food, entertainment, and health insurance.  You won't be able to park anywhere and everywhere, but thankfully, there are many areas where you can legally park for free.You can usually park and camp for free on public land as long as it is zoned for that purpose. Some districts will require you to choose a site with an established campfire ring, and other restrictions may apply. Check with the ranger's office in each district for more specific guidelines. Some commercial parking lots and truck stops will allow you to park for free overnight, but you'll usually need to clear out after a day or two. You can also search for campgrounds and RV parks, but you may need to pay some fee for using these services. If you have pets (especially dogs), you also need to make sure that the places you choose to stop allow you to bring pets.  When you stop somewhere, make sure that you're close enough to a town that will give you access to the necessary facilities required for meeting meet your daily needs.   At minimum, you'll need to stop near towns that have a grocery store and various restaurants. If you do not have laundry facilities in your RV, you will also need to locate nearby laundromats.  Even if you don't need a second vehicle to tow your RV, you should still maintain one in the event that your RV falls into temporary or permanent disrepair.   You can tow your car or keep it in a central, easily accessible location. Cars are more fuel-efficient than RVs, so having your car with you will allow you to take more scenic drives and make it easier to perform errands. Having a car also gives you some form of alternate transportation if your RV needs to go in for service.	Evaluate your reasons. Get a consensus. Practice before committing. Learn about licensing laws. Prepare a backup plan. Choose the best RV for your needs. Read the fine print. Downsize your belongings. Establish a permanent address. Sign up with a mail forwarding service. Switch to online billing and banking. Stay connected. Manage your income. Budget your expenses. Locate legal parking areas. Choose your stops wisely. Maintain a second vehicle.
You will need 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket and 6-8 skeins for a larger throw blanket.   Crochet hooks range in size from B to S, with S being the largest. The bigger the hook, the larger the stitch.  The single crochet is the easier of the two, so beginners should learn the single crochet before attempting the double crochet.  Slide a slipknot onto the crochet hook, wrap the yarn around the hook from the back to the front and draw a new loop through the knot.  Start behind the hook and come over the hook and then draw it underneath.   For a double crochet, insert the hook under the fourth loop from the hook. Yarn over the hook and pull it through the center of the chain. Then yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the first two loops from the hook. Repeat for the last two loops on the hook.  Work from left to right.  You can switch colors whenever you get to the end of a row before flipping your work if you like.  Incorporate any loose ends into the blanket with small stitches before trimming the ends.	Choose your yarn and crochet hook size. Decide whether you want to make a single crochet or a double crochet blanket. Make a foundation chain of stitches along your needle. To make a single crochet stitch, wrap the end of the yarn around the hook. At the end of the row, flip your work so that the last stitch made is now the first stitch to be worked for the next row. Continue this process until you have about a foot of yarn left. Cut the leftover yarn down to about six inches and thread it through your needle, pulling it through the last loop on your crochet hook.
When the time signature reads 4/4, each measure has four beats and the quarter note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 2 beats, the eighth note is worth ½ beat, and the sixteenth note is worth ¼ beat.   If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4.” If the measure had one quarter note followed by six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2-&, 3-&, 4-&.” “&” represents a ½ beat.  When the time signature reads 2/2, each measure receives two beats and the half note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth two beats, the quarter note is worth 1/2 beat, the eighth note is worth 1/4 beat, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/8 beat.   If the measure had two half notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2.” If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&.” “&” represents a 1/2 beat. If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-e-&-a, 2.” “e-&-a” represents a ¼ beat.  When the time signature reads 6/8, each measure receives six beats and the eighth note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 4 beats, the quarter note is worth 2 beats, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/2 beat.   If the measure had six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.” If the measure had 3 quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-2, 3-4, 5-6.”. If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&, 3-4-5-6.” “&” represents a ½ beat.	Count in 4/4 time. Count in 2/2 time. Count in 6/8 time.
Most of the materials mentioned in the things you'll need section can be procured at online shopping sites or hardware retail shops. Some, such as the laser diode, can be found in other electronic devices such as a disk burner.; , Many countries have laws governing the use and power of laser pointers. You can even be prosecuted for having a laser pointer which exceeds the permissible power limit. Be sure to keep the law in mind and tone down your laser pointer as and when necessary.  You will need to drill two holes in the casing. Drill one on the top of the casing. This will be the switch. Drill another hole on the side of the casing for the laser.  Some casings come with laser diodes built in. If your casing comes with a built in laser diode, check whether it is powerful enough for your needs. If it isn't, gently remove the laser diode and replace it with a new one.  Any battery pack will do, as long as it is powerful enough.  You can solder pins on the laser diode to make the attachment easier.  Add a switch, and solder all the components to the casing.  Check whether it works. If it doesn't , you may need to replace the power source or check whether all the components are attached correctly.	Gather your materials. Keep the law in mind. Drill the holes. Insert the laser diode into the casing. Add a power source to your laser. Attach the power source to the laser diode. Put on the finishing touches. Test your laser pointer.
Before you add your varnish, use paint to create an additional decorative design along the outside of your beads. For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead.  To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.  Don't thread the beads on string; use string to create a decorative pattern along the outside of the paper. Cut a small piece of colored thread and use glue to wrap the exterior of the bead with the string. Use several pieces of string for added color and texture.  Use colored florists wire to thread the beads and create pretty spiral or geometric patterns around the outside. Run the wire through the middle of the bead, and then bend it to shape around the bead.  Use a translucent nail polish or watered down paint to coat your bead in an additional color. Adding the glaze will create a light, semi-opaque layer of color over the paper. You can also use watercolor paints for this.,	Add paint. Put on a little glitter. Wrap the beads up in string.

Decoupage gloss sealer is a crafting product that is used to seal small pieces, like glitter or a piece of fabric, under a clear and durable gloss. You can find decoupage gloss sealer, which you may find packaged as ‘gloss sealer’, at craft stores.Choose a decoupage gloss sealer that is acrylic if you need a more heavy-duty seal. Be sure to purchase a glossy finish sealer; matte sealers will dull your glitter’s shine on the finished product., While working in your glitter station, use an inexpensive paintbrush to paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer to the wood. Be sure to only paint the areas that you want glitter to adhere to.   Make sure that the paintbrush doesn’t leave streaks while you are painting. You want the layer of gloss sealer to be evenly applied on the wood., While the gloss is still wet, sprinkle glitter onto the wood. You can use as much, or as little, glitter as you’d like.   Feel free to add a second layer of gloss over the glitter. This acts as a sealant and helps to prevent prevents glitter from falling off.  Let your newly glittered piece dry. Depending on how many layers of decoupage gloss sealer you’ve added, drying times will vary.	Use decoupage gloss sealer. Paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer. Sprinkle glitter over the wet gloss. Let dry.
What you need to complete this project is listed below under "Things You'll Need".; ,,, Miter the lower corners of the bag to add support, if needed.  Layer one-inch (2.5cm) strips, on top of each other, about two inches (5cm) below the opening.  Cut open each buttonhole with a pair of scissors.  Pinking helps to keep fabric from raveling.   Or, turn the edge of the opening over twice, to form a quarter-inch hemline and stitch it in place.    Weave one string entirely around the opening. Tie the ends of the strings together into a knot, to create a strap at one side of the bag. Weave one string around half of the opening. Weave another string around the other half of the opening. Tie the ends of the strings together into a knot, to create two straps – one at either side of the bag. Use long straps to carry the bag over your shoulder.  Tie the strings into a knot to secure the gathered opening.  If you're not using it, the string can be used to hang the bag on a hook.	Assemble your chosen fabric and sewing supplies. Fold the fabric in half.  , Cut a rectangle to your desired length and width.  , With right sides together, stitch the side seams and bottom of the bag, leaving a half-inch (1.27cm) seam allowance. Iron two strips of interfacing "around" the wrong side of the opening. Place buttonholes equidistantly, "around" the opening of the bag, over the strips of interfacing. Using pinking shears, trim the fabric around the edge of the opening. Weave a sturdy string through the buttonholes. Pull on the strings to gather the fabric at the opening of the bag. Fill the bag with your desired items and it's ready to go.
Vintage brands such as Puch have more complicated starting processes. First, if the lock has been engaged, start unlocking the moped using the keylock right below the handlebars. Move the handlebar to the right. Put the key inside the lock.   Be aware that different brands may require more or less steps to start.  First turn the key to the right. When it is turned to the right, you should be able to push it in. Once you do that, turn the key back to the left until the moped is unlocked., On a Puch Maxi, for example, you’ll find the fuel valve on the right side of the moped’s frame. This is a switch you must turn off when you park the moped. You may see the “on” and “off” labels on your moped. Pull the lever into the “on” position.  Look near the handlebars for the engine switch. On the Puch Maxi, it’s on the right side. Make sure the switch is flipped to the “run” position.  This only needs to be done if the engine is cold from disuse. Locate the carburetor. It’ll have a small black bar poking out of it. This is the choke, which you need to press and hold. While you do this, look downwards and find the small primer button on the carburetor. Press this too., Hold the front brake, which is on the right side of the handlebars, so you keep the moped under control. Find the starting lever under the left handlebar. Keep the pedals level as you pull it., Continue holding the starting lever as you begin to pedal. The engine should start and you should be free to go. If it doesn’t start, you may need to try pedal starting it.	Put the key in the lock. Turn the key. Turn on the fuel valve. Flip the engine switch. Depress the choke. Pull the starting lever. Push the pedal.
You can buy a siding cleaning kit with a nozzle attachment from your local home improvement store. Or, you can buy an automobile brush that will attach to your hose. You can use only water to clean if your house isn’t heavily soiled. If it is, you will need to use a cleanser. A siding kit should come with a compartment to pour the cleanser into the attachment.You can find cleanser specifically made for washing the outside of houses at most home improvement stores.  Spray your hose at a downward angle. Work from the bottom to the top of the house. Work in small, separate sections at a time., If you used more than water, you will need to rinse off the cleanser. Again, work from top to bottom as you rinse off the house with only water. You do not need to do anything to dry off the house.	Use a cleaning kit or brush to clean the outside of your hose. Work from the bottom to the top. Rinse with water if a cleaner was used.
If you are working with an agent or a specific publisher, make sure you ask them about or familiarize yourself with their specific guidelines for the synopsis. You want to make sure you format it and submit it the way they want so it gets the best reception possible.If you are unsure, ask the agent or publisher about length, formatting, and style. Even if this is an assignment for a class, make sure you adhere to the instructions or guidelines your teacher provided.  Just like a synopsis for a work of fiction, you need to offer a brief summary of the content.Focus on clearly articulating your argument, and explain why the book should be published. Make an argument for why your book is important in some way.  Even if you have not finished the book, you should still be able to provide a clear outline of its structure in the synopsis. Provide a chapter breakdown with temporary titles for each chapter, which will give an agent or publisher a good idea of the direction the work is headed.You can also include a short description (1 to 2 sentences) of each chapter.  In the synopsis, explain what sets your book apart from existing material on the subject. Discuss how you bring something different to the table.For example, does your book offer a unique perspective or a new way of thinking about a topic? List the leading authors and publications in the field and be clear about how your project is original. Also, describe why you are the author best suited or qualified to produce this work.  A publisher will look at your book and try to determine its place in the market and the intended audience. Take space in the synopsis to discuss where you see the book fitting in to the existing market.Include information on the section of the bookstore or bookshop you see your book being stocked in. This helps publishers assess whether the book will have an audience and how it should be marketed. Are there groups you think would have a definite interest in this book? For example, would this be used in specific college courses, or are there events such as historical anniversaries that the book could be linked to and marketed around?, Many nonfiction books are accepted while still being written, but you should provide a clear time table of your anticipated progress in the synopsis.Discuss how much is currently completed, and give an estimate of when you expect to have a manuscript prepared.  Include other pertinent details in the synopsis, such as an estimated word count and information about whether you will need illustrations. The more information you include about the structure and format of the book, the easier it will be for a publisher to determine if they would like to take the project on., To strengthen your synopsis, share the interesting and unique credentials that helped you write the book.While education and training are important things to mention, also think about whether there are parts of your background or life that publishers and readers may find interesting.  Like any writing activity, sharing a draft of your synopsis with others can help you improve your wording and make the synopsis clearer and more compelling. Ask friends, family, and colleagues for feedback on a draft.   You do not have to be a specialist in the field to determine if a synopsis is interesting and readable, so don’t worry about finding someone who is an expert on the subject matter you write about.	Follow any specific guidelines provided. Include a brief summary of the book. Outline the structure of the work. Identify how your book is different from the competition. Discuss the market for the book. Address your time table. Provide additional details. Promote your credentials. Ask for feedback.
If the area to be divided is longer than one curtain, choose another one or two in the same design.   If the design is stripes, spots or some other pattern, you might consider varying the colors, as long as they match nicely.  Hang this either at ceiling height or above the area of a tall person walking through.   You may also like to attach a curtain tieback hook on a wall or area for ease of pulling the curtain back to one side if needed. This step is optional. , Pull the hung curtain across to create the divider.	Choose a shower curtain with a design you think is perfect for the space to be divided. Hang up a line of strong wire across the area to be divided. Slip shower curtain rings into the shower curtain(s).  , Hang the shower curtain across the wire.
Tuberose bulbs are best planted in early spring after the last frost, but this requires a warm climate with a growing season at least 4 months long, and a USDA hardiness zone of 8, 9, or 10.If you have a shorter growing season, start the tuberose indoors in early spring and transfer once night temperatures outdoors are above 60ºF (15.5ºC).   If you live in zone 7 or below, you will need to bring tuberose indoors for the winter. Zones 8-10 correspond to a minimum winter temperature between 10ºF (-12.2ºC) and 35ºF (1.7ºC). Zone 7 has a minimum winter temperature of 0ºF (-17.8ºC).; , Tuberose needs well draining, highly nutritious soil. To improve your garden soil, mix in organic material such as peat moss, compost, or old, decomposing manure. Pile this mixture up 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) above the original soil surface to raise it above pooling water.Tuberose prefers a soil pH between 6.5 to 7, but are fairly adaptable and should do fine in environments with pH as low as 5.5.You may use a large, well draining pot instead of a raised bed.  Plant in a location that gets full sun for about 6-8 hours during the day. Tuberose is native to hot climates, and will only need to be moved to bright partial shade if it shows signs of withering or drying before the end of the growing season.  If you have purchased a cluster of bulbs, plant the entire cluster.Place bulbs or clusters of bulbs about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) apart to allow for growth.  Give the tuberose bulb a thorough watering to settle the soil around the plant.   Move on to next section to learn how to care for the bulbs and growing plants. Growth should be visible within a few weeks.  Keep the soil fairly dry, but water before it dries out fully. Within a few weeks, green tips should emerge, and root systems will develop that allow the plant to handle more water., As tuberose grows, provide roughly 1–1.5 in. (2.5–3.75 cm) of water once a week.Tuberose prefers this to more frequent watering in smaller amounts.   Reduce watering if rain occurs, so the tuberose only receives a total of approximately 1–1.5 in. (2.5–3.75 cm) of water each week. Take care not to over water, as tuberose rots easily (the reason you really need well-draining soil).  An 8-8-8 fertilizer, with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is recommended for tuberose. Apply solid fertilizer around the soil of the plant once every 6 weeks, or apply liquid fertilizer according to packaging instructions., The flowers typically emerge about 90-120 days after planting, usually in the late summer or early autumn.Removal of the flowers for house display will not harm the plant, so enjoy bringing the scent into your home.   If the weather is turning cold and the plant has not yet flowers, transplant the tuberose to a large pot, and bring it to a warm location indoors. Remember, the pot must be well-draining, with a hole in the base and something beneath it to catch the water. Keep in mind that the tuberose flowers are very fragrant. They will be at their peak of fragrance during the evening hours.  The flowers will start to weigh the branches down when they start to bloom, so you may want to add some form of support. Place a trellis in the ground next to the plant or use a cage to help support the plant from all sides., Even if you don't bring flowers indoors, remove the withered flowers to encourage new growth. Do not remove any leaves until they are completely yellow.  Once the foliage is yellow or brown, the plant is done growing for the year. Move on to the next section if you expect a cold winter, or simply leave it in the ground if you are located in USDA hardiness zones 8 or higher, and expect a typical winter.   Do not apply any fertilizer while the plant is not growing.  If you are located in a USDA hardiness zone numbered 8 or higher, the tuberose will probably be fine if left in the ground year round. In zone 7, you may be able to insulate the soil with a thick layer of mulch, and remove it in spring.In any other zone, move the tuberose bulbs indoors.   Zone 8 corresponds with a minimum winter temperature of 10ºF (-12.2ºC). Zone 7 has a minimum winter temperature of 0ºF (-17.8ºC).  The tuberose may survive one light frost, but it's best not to risk it. The first frost may come in autumn or winter, depending on your climate.  Remove yellow leaves and cut the stem down to 4–6 inches (10–15cm) above the soil.Use a clean knife, preferably sterilized with rubbing alcohol to minimize chance of infection.  Dig out a large clump of soil with the bulb inside, then brush off the soil to reveal the bulb. Dig slowly and carefully to avoid breaking the roots.  Lay the bulbs on a screen in the sun for 24 hours to dry them out.If there is no sun, leave them in a dry area for several days instead. Do not attempt to speed this up by heating them.  Use a cardboard box, tray, or any other container that can hold peat moss, sawdust, or vermiculite. Cover the tuberose with the material and store at about 50ºF (10ºC)., In most cases, the tuberose can be left alone the entire winter. However, if you notice the bulbs shriveling, lightly moisten the packing material once or twice during the winter. On the other hand, if roots appear, move to a dry location., Tuberose can be planted in the spring after being kept overwinter, and the new bulbs around the original will flower as normal.After several years of growth, a cluster may be too large for adequate flower growth. Separate the smaller bulbs and plant separately, but be aware that some newly separated bulbs may not grow in the first year., Get a one gallon pot that has drainage holes on the bottom of it. Fill the pot halfway full with moist potting soil. Then, set the rhizomes on top of soil and add enough soil until the rhizomes are about three inches below the rim of the pot. Add about two more inches of soil after that to top it off., Water the soil until water runs out of the bottom of the pot. After that, you will only need to water it when the top ½ inch of soil is dry Check it once every few days to see when it needs to be watered.  It is also a good idea to fill the tray that goes under the pot with gravel and pour water over it. Then, place the pot on top of the gravel. This will help to ensure that the plant gets plenty of humidity.  It is important to place the tuberose somewhere that it will get sun exposure all day long and where it will warm.Try to keep your home at a constant temperature of 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Check around your house to find the ideal location., Dilute ½ teaspoon of soluble fertilizer—preferably a 5-10-10 mixture—in one gallon of water. Then, irrigate the plant with this solution every two weeks once the plant is actively growing., In the fall, you will need to remove the rhizomes from the pot. Break the smaller rhizomes off the larger ones, and then throw out the large one. Store the small ones in a cool, dark spot until spring, so that you can plant them again.	Decide where and when to plant. Prepare the soil. Select a sunny location. Plant in a hole 2 in (5cm) deep. Water generously after planting. Water sparingly until plants emerge. Water moderately during the growing season. Apply a balanced fertilizer. Feel free to cut flowers to arrange indoors. Support the flowers if needed. Prune to encourage growth. Stop watering when the flowers and leaves die. Consider whether you need to move the plant indoors. Move the plants before the first frost. Cut back the foliage. Dig out the bulbs carefully. Wait for them to dry. Pack the bulbs in soft material. Adjust moisture if necessary. Plant in spring. Add soil and rhizomes to a pot. Water the tuberose. Place the potted tuberose in a warm, sunny location. Fertilize the tuberose. Remove the rhizomes in the fall.
Plants that are drought and heat resistant will be less likely to wither or die when you miss a watering. Heat resistant plants will be less sensitive to differences in light in your garden and will likely still thrive with a little direct sunlight during the hot parts of the day, which can cause more sensitive plants to wilt or die.   Plants native to prairie or semi-arid environments are oftentimes drought and heat resistant. You can find a more complete list of plants like this by doing a online keyword search for “drought and heat resistant perennials.”  , Some plants keep on growing, getting bigger and bigger. These generally require pruning and weeding to prevent them from taking over your garden. This creates more work for you, so for the lowest maintenance garden, you should avoid plants with unrestrained growth cycles. Some plants to avoid include:   Wisteria Magnolia grandifloraWinter Creeper English Ivy, Plants with short bloom cycles often, though not always, require specific conditions to be met for a good bloom. Plants that bloom throughout the season or for long spans during its growing season are generally less sensitive to shocks.   Even if you forget to water or you’re not the kind of gardener who can fertilize regularly, plants with long bloom cycles will, in many cases, keep on blooming. Some common long-blooming perennials include Black-eyed Susan, Moonbeam, Husker Red, Astilbes, and Hellebores.	Select plants that are drought and heat resistant. Prioritize plants with restrained growth. Choose plants with long bloom cycles.
Make sure the fabric is evenly stretched, neither too tight nor too loose. If it's too loose, it will sag and the dye will make puddles. Making it too tight may damage the fabric.; , Wet down the silk with this solution (it will later allow the dye to spread and dry with a soft edge). It also allows more time to paint as it slows down the drying time. This is called the Wet-on-Wet technique.  In this example, red is the primary color and a simple striped pattern is used for the background. Notice how the lines have a soft, fuzzy edge to them.  In general, always start with light shades then move on to darker colors. Since the colors in silk painting are transparent, once you go dark, it's hard to go back to light. If you want white spaces, then you should leave the silk without any color.  You may notice some of the colors separating (shown by the presence of an orange shadow or halo next to the red in this example, even though only various shades of red were used). This happens to some colors especially when working with the Wet-on-Wet technique.  This is called Line Building or Wet-on-Dry technique. These lines will dry with a hard edge and if the application is a bit darker in color, it will also have a dark outline around it. , You can also add salt to the silk as you spray to achieve a more mottled texture, as shown.  The dye that is applied over a previously salted layer will still react with the salt and create neat swirly designs and jagged edges.	Stretch your silk on a frame. Spray the silk with a diluted mix of water and rubbing alcohol (two parts alcohol to one part distilled water). Apply the first layer of dye while the silk is still wet. Add a darker color (such as a darker shade of your primary color) next to add dimension to the design while the silk is still wet. Allow the first layer to dry. Add an even darker shade of your primary color to the dry silk. Add decorative touches such as simple dots.  , Soften harsh lines by spraying on the diluted mix again. Paint additional designs of your choice with the darkest shade of your primary color using the wet-on-dry technique again. Allow the silk to dry thoroughly before putting it on.

Special skills can be anything from music to juggling to skateboarding to foreign languages to sports -- things that make you stand out to an agent or could be useful in a stage or commercial setting.  There are lots of good professional agents, but unfortunately, this industry also has plenty of people who just want your money. Legitimate talent agents are paid if and when an actor gets work. If an agent asks for representation fees, or requires you to take specific classes or work with specific photographers, be very wary. Get the Call Sheet. Backstage publishes the Call Sheet, available in bookstores or online, which lists all the agencies in New York City and Los Angeles. Contact all the agencies that have a youth department.

Smothering weed seeds with mulch will hinder their germination and could prevent them from growing all together.Keep your garden or lawn area well mulched in order to prevent weed growth.   Spread the mulch 2 to 4 inches deep to retain moisture and to stop weed growth. Organic mulches like hardwood mulch, shredded bark, pine needles and straw degrade over a couple of months and can provide additional nutrition to your soil., Pulling weeds from the ground with your hands is the simplest way to rid your garden or lawn of unwanted weeds. Identify weeds as they grow and pull them. You can also opt to sever the roots of the weeds with a knife by stabbing the dirt under the weed where the roots are.Weeds are easier to pull when the soil is moist. A single dandelion can create 15,000 seeds in a single year, which may lead to additional weeds in your garden. Pull or sever the weeds when they’re young before they can create more seeds., If there is already weed growth in your garden, tilling or hoeing the weeds will uproot smaller annual weeds while severing the flowers off perennial weeds. Once you are done tilling or hoeing, discard the weeds and use mulch to prevent seeds from sprouting new ones.If you do not have weed growth, refrain from tilling or hoeing your garden or lawn, as this can activate dormant weed seeds under the soil.	Use mulch to smother the weeds. Pull visible weeds in your garden. Hoe or till your lawn.
Wash with soap, use a specialized plastic cleaner, or soak the plastic in isopropyl alcohol to clean.Dry thoroughly.   Avoid touching the piece with your bare hands afterward, to minimize oil residue.  Briefly sand the plastic with 120-200 grit sandpaper to create a rough surface for the glue to bond to. Steel wool or emery cloth will also work, but remember it only needs to be rubbed briefly.  Two-part "epoxies" require two ingredients to be mixed together to activate the adhesive. Read the instructions on the container carefully, as there are many types of epoxy and each requires a certain ratio of the two ingredients. Some of them can be used for several hours after mixing, while others require application within a few minutes.   See Selecting a Glue to learn which type of glue to use. You can skip this step if you are not using a two-part adhesive.  Use a small brush to apply an even layer of adhesive to both surfaces where they will be attached. For tiny pieces, such as a broken piece on a plastic model, you can use the tip of a needle instead.   If you are using a solvent cement (not a poly cement or plastic cement), you should clamp the pieces together first, then use an applicator bottle to put a thin line of solvent cement along the edge between the pieces, where it will be drawn between them.If you are using it on plastic pipes, see Gluing Plastic Pipes instead.  Press them together to get them in place and remove air bubbles. Don't push so hard that the adhesive oozes out of the joint. If it does, wipe away the excess unless you are using an acrylic cement, which should be left to evaporate.  Use a clamp, vise, masking tape, or rubber bands to hold them firmly together. Read the instructions on your adhesive container to know how long to leave them in place. Depending on the type and brand of adhesive, the bond could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to develop.   Many plastic adhesives continue to "cure", or develop a stronger bond, for days or even weeks after application. Avoid applying stress and heat to the glued piece for at least 24 hours after application, even if the bond seems strong.	Remove grease from the plastic. Sand the surface to be glued. Mix the two glue components together if required. Apply glue to both surfaces. Press the pieces lightly together. Keep the pieces firmly in place.
WD-40 can remove dust and grime from stainless-steel appliances, including your refrigerator, stovetop, dishwasher, laundry machine, and clothes dryer.Spray the WD-40 onto dirty areas from about 2–3 inches away, and let sit for a couple of minutes before wiping down with a wet rag or a soapy sponge.   Although WD-40 can be used to remove splattered grease around kitchen in general, it’s less effective for this purpose than soap and water, or a general-purpose cleaner like Windex., The lubricating properties of WD-40 make it a useful for loosening dirt and grime in hard-to-reach places, including between kitchen or patio tiles. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube about 1 inch away from the tiles or sections of grout that you wish to clean, and spray liberally. Let the fluid sit for a few minutes, and then clean up with soapy water.This method will clean a variety of substances off of tile, in addition to general dirt and grime, including: paint, scuff marks, makeup, and nail polish.  Many porcelain surfaces in the bathroom are stained by mineral buildup from hard water. Other stains build up on these bathroom amenities as well, including some that may be left behind by other cleaning supplies. You can remove these by spraying WD-40 directly onto the stain, and then and then scrub vigorously with your toilet brush (or a sponge).You should not use WD-40 to replace regular toilet cleaner, as WD-40 cannot kill germs and bacteria. Rather, only use WD-40 to remove specific stains that general toilet cleaner can’t remove. WD-40 can be used to remove stains from other surfaces made of porcelain (or a similar substance). For example, use it in your kitchen or dining room to remove stains made from tea or coffee cups.	Spray onto stainless-steel appliances to clean and shine them. Clean tiles and grout with WD-40. Clean stains from your toilet, sink, and bathtub.
These types of tires work reliably in all seasons, but if you are in a climate with heavy snow and ice, snow tires might be better for you.; , Check out the type of tires that are on your car.   Consider buying the same tires that came with your car, if they are all seasonal. Engineers often match the tire suspension to the rubber when they are putting tires on your car.  You can find safety reviews in Consumer Reports, or consumer magazines such as Car and Driver or Popular Mechanics.   Check websites belonging to consumer magazines for more updated reports than the printed publications often contain.  The person or business that does most of your car repairs may be able to recommend an all seasonal tire for your car.  Look at what Michelin, Goodyear, Bridgestone and other well-known brands have to offer in all seasonal tires.   Compare prices. Unless you are buying tires of an unusual size, most all seasonal tires will cost between $130 and $200 per tire when they are new.       Check the tire tread. Look for something that will provide good traction on all road surfaces and in all weather conditions. Look for an open tread pattern and a narrower tread.       Research the ability of the tire to accelerate and brake. You can ask a tire sales associate about this, or read up on it in safety reviews.  All tires are rated for their ability to grip the road. You will see a stamp that says A, AA, B or C on the tire. Buy A or AA for the best traction.  If you put few miles on your car and you find tires that are used but reliable, you can probably save money on your all seasonal tires.  Find out how many miles can go on the tires before you will need to replace them.  Talk to your dealer or mechanic about the best tires to buy, and then look for the best deal you can find.   Check discount tire centers. Their prices are often more competitive than car dealers.       Look for tires online. There are wholesale tire retailers online who might have lower prices than the tire stores you visit. Check sites such as Tire Rack and Tire Buyer.	Make sure you live in the right climate for all seasonal tires. Start with the tires your car came with. Review safety ratings. Talk to a trusted mechanic. Shop the established brands. Check the traction rating on the tire. Consider previously owned tires if they are in good condition. Ask about mileage. Compare prices. Finished.
Ignition assemblies are easily replaced in most vehicles and can be done at home by most hobby mechanics. Before getting started, you will need to order a replacement assembly from your local auto parts store. Be sure to give them the exact year, make and model of your vehicle to get the correct replacement part.Vehicle manufacturers don’t change part numbers often and obtaining the correct replacement from part stores is not usually an issue. Purchase a new ignition lock assembly prior to the removal of a failed assembly. Compare the two and verify the replacement is an identical match before attempting reinstallation.  Generally, most vehicles have a split-plastic housing that covers the steering column and ignition lock assembly. Remove this plastic cover by first adjusting the tilt-wheel to its lowest position and then removing the fasteners holding the cover in place. In some vehicles, the cover will include the portion above and below the steering wheel, while in others the ignition cover will be separate.If it's not equipped with an adjustable steering column, remove the steering column support brace under the dashboard and allow the column to hang. Remove the fasteners from the column cover, separate the two halves and remove the plastic.  Identify the ignition assembly and remove any trim components that prevent access to the ignition wire harness connector and tumbler release hole. Insert a 9/32” Allen wrench into the release hole while turning the ignition key backward.Use the ignition key to pull the entire assembly out by pulling it toward the passenger side of the car. Take care to unplug the ignition switch wire connector as you remove the ignition cylinder.  Once the ignition assembly is removed, compare the new switch and ensure they match. New ignition switches come pre-lubed from the factory ready to install. Verify the presence of grease on all external moving parts and ensure the new key fits and that the cylinder rotates smoothly in both directions.If the ignition cylinder is not properly greased, apply liquid graphite or similar grease to the cylinder. Purchase grease at your local auto parts store if necessary.  You can make sure the internal lock pins move properly by inserting the key completely in and out of the keyhole several times. The key should not get caught or stuck on its way into our out of the key hole.Sticking lock pins are lubricated using powdered graphite that is applied directly inside the keyhole. Graphite comes in small tubes designed to “squirt” the powder with enough force to reach the back of any keyhole. It can be added when needed.  When satisfied the new assembly matches the old one and is properly lubricated, slide the cylinder into position and make sure it is locked in place. Reconnect the switch plug and reinstall any trim components previously removed.Rotate the cylinder forward using the key until you head it click into place. Be sure to plug the ignition wire switch into the new cylinder before sliding it into place.  Before securing the steering column (if disconnected) and plastic cover, check to make sure the engine will start and steering wheel lock will /disengage. Do so by inserting the key and turning it while applying pressure to the wheel in the opposite direction of the lock pin.Steering column bolts usually have torque specifications which are located in the vehicle’s repair manual, in the specification section. If no torque specs are found, tighten bolts firmly using a long handled ratchet for leverage. Column bolts must be secure to ensure they don’t vibrate loose while driving.	Purchase a new ignition lock assembly. Remove the cover over the ignition. Use an Allen wrench to release the ignition assembly. Make sure the new ignition switch is well-greased. Ensure that the internal lock pins can move freely. Slide the cylinder into place and reconnect the switch plug. Start the engine to ensure the steering wheel lock disengages.
Never attempt to load a motorcycle into a pickup truck on uneven ground, or soft ground that may give way as you move the motorcycle. Black top or concrete are the preferred surfaces to use when loading your bike into a pickup truck.Never use pieces of wood on grass or dirt as a loading surface, as the wood may sink, break or slide. Do not attempt to load a motorcycle into a truck on an uneven surface to prevent falling over or dropping the motorcycle itself as you load it.; , You should always use a ramp intended for use in loading motorcycles onto trucks and trailers when doing so. Motorcycles can be extremely heavy, so the ramp must be designed to be able withstand the weight of the motorcycle. These ramps usually fold in half to easily transport them, so unfold it and place the rubber end on the tailgate of the truck. The metal end should rest flat on the ground.The rubber will protect the tailgate of the truck from being scratched as the truck’s suspension lowers under the weight of the motorcycle. Be sure the ramp rests evenly on the ground to ensure it does not damage your motorcycle tire or cause it to move in an unpredictable way when you’re pushing it onto the ramp.  Most ramps will have a hook intended for use in securing the ramp to the truck. Place one hook from a ratchet tie down (also known as a ratchet strap) through the hook on the ramp and secure the other end to a loop or hook in the bed of the truck. Use the ratchet to tighten the strap until the ramp is held firmly in place.Without a strap securing the ramp, it could slide backward and fall off the tailgate of the truck when you push the motorcycle onto it. Do not use a bungee strap to secure the ramp. Bungee straps may give, allowing the ramp to fall.  If you leave your motorcycle in gear to prevent the wheels from rolling when you aren’t riding it, you will need to take it back out of gear in order to push it. Motorcycle shift levers are located on the side of the motorcycle and are controlled by the rider’s left foot. Press down on the shift lever until the motorcycle is in first gear, the pull back up on the lever lightly to put it in neutral.Neutral in a motorcycle is found between first and second gear. Most motorcycles have a neutral light on the gauge pod to let you know that the motorcycle is in neutral.  Pushing your motorcycle onto the truck should be a two person job. Attempting to do so alone could result in the motorcycle falling, causing significant harm to the bike and to you. Place both of your hands on the handle bars of the motorcycle and ask your friend to push from the back. Roll it up the ramp together, but stop before the motorcycle is all the way into the truck. Use your right hand to squeeze the front brake lever on the handle bars to prevent the motorcycle from rolling backwards as your friend climbs into the bed of the truck to help pull it the rest of the way.Having your friend switch places halfway through will not be necessary if you can enlist the help of a third friend. Make sure the brakes are holding the weight of the motorcycle from rolling backward before your friend releases it to climb into the truck.	Park the truck and motorcycle on a firm, level surface. Unfold the motorcycle ramp and place the rubber end on the tailgate. Use a ratchet tie-down to secure the ramp to the truck. Put the motorcycle in neutral. Have a friend help push the motorcycle up the ramp.
Tell yourself, “I will read this chapter for one and a half hours.” Giving yourself a time-frame will help you stay on track as you read. If you begin to notice that you are reading a section for too long, get the main points and move on.Mark the section and come back to it if it is a particularly difficult section.  As you read, place your finger (or an index card or pen) below the first word of the sentence and move it as you read. Your finger will help your eyes focus on the words you are reading, instead of other pictures and information.Additionally, using a pointer can you help control how fast or slow you read something; for example, the faster you move your finger the faster you will read and vice versa.  Sub-vocalization is reading aloud in your head and/or moving your lips as you read. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it can slow down your reading rate. Reduce your sub-vocalization by chewing gum or listening to music while you read. By forcing yourself to read faster you may also be able to reduce sub-vocalization.Additionally, there are apps and programs that can help you reduce your sub-vocalization.  Reading faster isn’t just about reading fast, but about controlling your speed. In other words, slow your reading when you encounter concepts that you are unfamiliar with or do not understand. Then, increase your speed once you have gauged the meaning.	Give yourself a time-frame. Use a pointer to focus on the material. Try not to sub-vocalize. Control the speed of your reading.
Every shinigami goes by an exotic name. It's the only way for other shinigami, or even humans, to identify you. Try using Japanese adjectives to give your name a unique, shinigami-esque sound, while describing your personality. Try names such as Daku (dark) or Kandaina (generous) to comply with your shinigami's tastes. If you want, make up your own words!; , The most well-known shinigami, Ryuk, always had a taste for red apples in the human world. Other shinigami, such as Midora, also seem to take a liking to humans' fruits. In her case, bananas. Try picking your favorite fruit, and be sure to pick one that you wouldn't mind eating very often. Shinigami that are addicted to fruit, as Ryuk explains, experience withdrawal symptoms if they don't eat that fruit in a while.  Okay, so you don't actually have to get shinigami eyes, you just have to pretend you have them. Wear contacts to change your eye color to red, yellow, or maybe even purple. The purpose of shinigami eyes is to see the full name and remaining lifespan of a human, to enable a shinigami to write that human's name in their death note and thus extend their own lifespans. However, be warned that shinigami eyes do not work on death note users or other shinigami, so if you're cosplaying alongside a death note user or shinigami, be careful as to not acknowledge the fact that you can use your eyes on them-because you can't.  All shinigami look different. They can take on an almost human shape, such as Ryuk, or even a completely odd and non-humanoid form such as in the case of Nu. Some shinigami may even meet in the middle, having almost an even split between human and non-human features, such as Sidoh. This is the aspect of creating a shinigami OC where you have the most freedom, because shinigami can look very different from each other. Start by drawing some various designs and pick your favorite to develop on. Keep in mind that all shinigami have wings, and it's up to you to decide how you want them to look.  You're going to need quite the assortment of supplies to make your vision of becoming a shinigami come to life, er, un-life. To begin, a death note is for certain required by all means! Without a death note, a shinigami has no means to survive whatsoever. You're also going to need costume materials to make yourself look like a shinigami, including the contact lenses mentioned in step #3. The amount of costume accessories and materials needed varies, depending on the complexity of your shinigami's design. For wings, try wrapping fabric around a wire rig, but letting it hang freely at the bottom.  Although some shinigami are able to read, write, and speak human languages fluently, all shinigami understand the shinigami's basic alphabet. This language is what is written on Misa Amane's death note, due to the fact that her shinigami, Rem, has difficulty writing Japanese. It is not expected that you would actually understand this fictional language, but writing in various scribbles may give the impression of a foreign alphabet.  Believe it or not, the shinigami do have a strict code of law, enforced by the King of Death and Armonia Justin Beyondormason. Death Note Wiki can provide a good look into the shinigami's rules as well as the typical behavior of a god of death. Some shinigami choose to disobey the typical customs proper for a shinigami, such as apathy and content, but it's rare to find a shinigami willing to break the rules set for them. If these laws are disobeyed, shinigami may be punished on a 9-1 rank, with 9 being the weakest form of punishment, and 1 being the most severe. Any rank from 3-1 will result in the shinigami's death.  Or maybe even a human! Have a shinigami get together and decorate your house like the shinigami realm. Invite your friends, tell them to dress as their shinigami OC! Going to anime conventions as an OC is never recommended, but it can be attempted by anyone willing to do so.  Remember, this is only cosplay. You will not ever become a shinigami or a killer! But warnings aside	Pick a name for yourself. Have an addiction to fruit. Get shinigami eyes. Figure out what your shinigami looks like. Round up some supplies. Write Shinigam-ish. Adhere to the shinigami customs. Hang out with other shinigami. Have fun and be realistic!
If you have not replaced the calipers or loosened any fittings, you can SKIP to the next section. You may wish to bleed the brakes later if you determine that the brake peddle feels mushy or goes down too far.   You'll need a good helper for this, and do one side at a time.  Grease and or fluid on the pads can keep your car's breaks from gripping properly and will make stopping harder. ,, This should be just enough to loosen it, being careful not to damage the screw (use a snugly fitting solid wrench, not pliers and not an adjustable wrench). Attach an appropriate size clear or rubber hose to the bleeder screw with the other end immersed in brake fluid in a jar or can before depressing the brake pedal. This helps to avoid sucking air back into the bleeder screw if the pedal is let up at the wrong time.  Some fluid may flow out or you may see bubbling from the tube in the jar while only air is coming out. While the pedal is at the floor, close the bleeder screw. Have your assistant slowly lift the pedal. While the brake pedal is all the way up, open the bleeder screw again.  Always tighten the bleeder screw before letting up the peddle; final check that it is tightened securely when finished. (Some brakes are gravity-bleed, and fluid will just run out when you open the screw, and only require you to open the bleeder screw until you see clean fluid, without working the brake pedal, but the pedal pressing procedure works in all cases).  If the fluid gets too low you'll be introducing air into the master-cylinder and brake system again and will have to bleed it all out, which is even more extensive than just clearing air out of the wheel-cylinders and hoses.	Bleed the brakes. Use break cleaner to clean up any grease from fingers/skin and any break fluid that may have gotten onto the rotor or pads during installation. Put the wheels back on the car to hold the rotor on straight, if it is the easy removal kind of rotor (separate from the hub).  , Do not let the car down from the jackstands yet.  , Remove the rubber cap from the hollow bleeder screw, and unscrew the bleeder screw about 1/4 or 1/2 turn. Have your assistant slowly depress the brake pedal until it's at the floor and keep there until you tell them to let it back up. Repeat the process of pressing the peddle down, closing the screw, letting up, loosening, return to pressing the peddle down, etc... until you see clean brake fluid (without bubbles) coming out of the bleeder. Make sure the brake fluid reservoir does not run empty while bleeding the brakes.
The first step in any septic installation is to perform a site survey and do a percolation (soil) test on the area where the POWTS is going to be installed. The system then can be designed based on the findings of the survey and results of the soil test. After this, the appropriate permits and approvals can be applied for.   Site survey findings that influence the design include things like:  available space topography intended purpose and perceived water use based on the size of the dwelling/building the system will service.   location of the well and/or neighboring wells. Soil test findings that influence the design include things like:  soil type and layering (sand, clay, rock, and where it is located relative to depth) ability of the soil to drain and filter wastewater.  Upon receipt of the necessary permits and approvals, the system can be installed. Be sure to perform the following procedures in compliance with any and all laws and applicable plumbing and building codes.	Prepare and design your system. Wait for approval.
On cardboard, draw out two tree trunks with branches and cut it out. An adult might need to help you cut the cardboard, since it can be really tough and unsafe to cut.   Make sure that the tree widens out at the bottom of the trunk, like how roots go into the ground. This will help the tree stand up!; , Cut a line in one of the trunks from the top of the trunk (where the branches start to grow), until just past the halfway point on the trunk. Then, on the second trunk, cut a similar line that goes halfway up from the bottom.  You can now slide one tree trunk onto the other! The tree that is cut from the bottom should fit into the one that was cut from the top. Now the tree can stand up!  , Using small squares of colored tissue paper, put a small spot of glue on the center of the paper and stick it on one of the branches of the tree. Keep going until you think your tree is done. You can make it look very full!  , Once you're done adding leaves, you can make your tree look even more special by adding other decorations. Try drawing and cutting out a squirrel to keep your tree company, or make a bird nest out of a pipe cleaner.	Make two tree trunks. Cut a center line. Fit the trunks together. Make the leaves. Decorate and enjoy!
If your vehicle was built prior to 1996, you will need an OBD I scanner. Vehicles made after 1996 will need an OBD II scanner. Connect the code scanner to the port beneath the dashboard and turn it on. Once connected, use the scanner to bring up the error codes making the check engine light come on.In some code scanners, it will provide the English description of the error code on the read out. If your code scanner does not, you will need to look up the code the scanner shows you to find out what it is.  Insert the key into the ignition and start the engine. Wait a minute for the engine idle to level off, then use a pen and paper to write down the RPMs that your engine settles and idles at.You may need to let the engine run for a few minutes in order for it to come down to its normal idle speed. Keep the paper you write the RPMs on handy so you can compare it to the engine’s idle as you continue the test.  With the idle RPMs noted, shut the vehicle back off and remove the key from the ignition. Open the hood and locate the Idle Control Motor. Once you locate it, disconnect it.The way to disconnect your Idle Control Motor will vary from application to application; refer to your vehicle’s service manual for more specific instruction as to how to disconnect it. You can usually disconnect the idle control motor by unplugging the wiring clip going into it.  With the Idle Control Motor disconnected, get back into the vehicle and start the engine again. The engine should still start and run without any issue despite the idle control motor being disconnected.Be sure to tuck the wiring you disconnected up in the engine bay so it doesn’t get caught in any moving parts.  Allow the engine to run for a minute so it settles to a consistent idle, then take note of any difference in the idle RPMs versus the idle you observed earlier. If the idle has not changed at all, it’s likely because your idle control motor has not been functioning.If the idle control motor was working, disconnecting it should have created a difference in the engine’s idle. This test confirms there’s an issue with the idle control motor, but not what the issue may be.  If you identified a difference in engine idle RPMs with the Idle control motor connected and disconnected, confirm your hypothesis by reconnecting it and starting the engine again.The idle should go back to what it was when the idle control motor was last connected. Refer to the note you took about idle RPMs to compare it to your first reading.	Use a code scanner to check error codes. Start the engine and take note of the idle RPMs. Shut the car off and disconnect the Idle Control Motor. Restart the engine. Look for a difference in idle speed. Shut off the engine and reconnect the Idle Control Motor.
It’s important to wear the appropriate protective equipment anytime you work on a car or truck. Car batteries contain a mixture of sulphuric acid and water that could cause serious harm if it gets into your eyes.Batteries can rupture if hooked up incorrectly, which could result in the water/acid mixture from the battery getting into your eyes. Wearing latex gloves can make it much easier to clean up after you’re done working on the car, but may not be necessary for this job.; , It’s important that you make sure the car is in park and turned off before beginning the process of replacing your battery cables. You will be working with the car’s electrical system, so leaving it running could increase the likelihood of you receiving an electrical shock and could possibly do damage to the vehicle.Remove the keys from the ignition to make sure no one can accidentally try to start it while you’re working under the hood. If your car is a standard, make sure the parking break is engaged instead of having the car in park.  Different automakers place the batteries in their cars in different locations for a number of reasons. Most car batteries can be located near the front or nose of the car on the left or right. It looks like a large, usually black box with two metal terminals sticking out of the top, each with cables attached. Make sure the hood struts can support the weight of the hood before you release it, otherwise it could fall and hurt you. If you cannot locate the battery under the hood of the car, it may be in the trunk.Some automakers place the battery in the trunk to improve weight distribution or save space. If you cannot locate your battery, refer to your owner’s manual. It will show you how to locate and access your battery.  Once you have located the battery, you will need to differentiate between the positive and negative terminals. Car battery cables are usually colored to match their use: red cables are positive, black cables are negative. In some cases, the wires may both be black, but they will have red and black boxes or accents at the ends of the cable.If there are no discernible colors visible, you can easily determine which is the negative cable by following them from the battery to the other end. Negative cables bolt directly to the body of the car or engine block, positive cables attach to the starter. The battery will have labels marked with a + and a – sign. The plus is the positive cable terminal, the – is the negative.  You will often find other wires attached to a battery cable using electric tape (particularly on the positive side). Sometimes these wires are held in place more securely using metal or plastic retainers. Do not remove these wires, but cut off any tape that prevents you from reaching the bolt that keeps the cable secured to the terminal.If the end of the cable is housed in a plastic box indicating if it is positive or negative, you can open the box by squeezing the two clips on either side of it. Be careful not to cut any wires when trying to access the bolts.  The negative cable, also called the ground cable, should be the first you disconnect. Once you disconnect this cable, the car will no longer have a completed electrical circuit, and you may notice any dashboard, interior or engine bay lights that were on will instantly shut off. This indicates that the battery is no longer connected to the car in a manner that can power it.You will need to loosen the bolt that holds the cable in place, but you will not need to remove it. If the bolt is seized or will not turn, try spraying some WD-40 on it. It will eat away some of the rust and oxidization and allow the bolt to turn more freely. Do not allow the negative cable to come into contact with the positive terminal at any time.  Because the negative cable is the one most often disconnected while working under the hood of a car, the positive one may by slightly more difficult to remove. Once the positive cable is disconnected from the battery, the battery will be completely disconnected and may be removed.Set the end of the cable aside so that it can’t fall back into place and make contact with either battery terminal. If your battery is in the trunk, the positive cable will attach to another connector near the body of the car. Simply disconnect it from there.  Some cars will not require the removal of the battery while replacing battery cables, but even if it is not necessary, it may make the process easier. Removing the battery can free up room to work and removes any possibility of the cables coming back into contact with their terminals and shocking you.Many cars have a bracket that holds the battery in place. Removing this bracket usually requires unscrewing two bolts. Make sure to set the battery upright after removing it from the car.  Start by following the negative cable from the now loose end back to where it is bolted to the engine block or body of the car. Take note of how it is routed so you can follow the same path with the new cable. Once you locate the other end, use a wrench to remove the bolt that holds the negative cable in place. Then repeat the process for the positive cable, which will be attached to the starter on the other end.Be sure the car is not hot while doing this or you may burn yourself. It’s important you remember the way the cables are routed through the engine bay to ensure they don’t interfere with any moving parts when you replace them.  With both the positive and negative cables removed, compare them to your replacement cables. If you purchased cables specific to your car, they should match in length and have the same terminal connectors at each end. If they don’t you will need to return them for the proper cables. If you are using universal cables that you cut to length, use the old cables as your guide.If the new cables are slightly longer than the old, that likely won’t be an issue, but shorter cables will not work. Make sure the connecting ends at either side of the new cables match the old ones for easy installation.  If there were plastic protective boxes on the old cable’s ends, remove them from the old cables and place them on the new ones. You will also need to ensure that there is no paint or dirt stuck on the new cable ends before you install them.The connections on either end of the cable should be bare metal to allow electricity to pass through them. You can use a steel toothed brush to clean off the connector ends of the cables in order to ensure a good electrical connection.  Use the same bolt you removed to disconnect the old cable to attach the new one in its place. If the bolt is rusted, you may want to use a steel wire brush to remove the rust from the bolt and ensure a proper connection. If it is too rusted, you may need to replace it.Make sure the bolt is good and tight so it can’t vibrate loose as the car runs. Run the new positive cable back through the engine bay in the same way the old one was.  Locate the hole the old negative cable was attached to and use the same bolt to connect the new cable. Once again, ensure the bolt is in good enough condition to hold the cable in place and allow electricity to pass through the cable.Run the new negative cable back through the engine bay in the same route the old one took. Use a flashlight to ensure neither cable is coming into contact with any belts. Belts spin at high speeds under the engine bay and can damage battery cables.  With both new cables in place, it’s time to place the battery back into the car. Make sure not to let the new cables come into contact with the battery terminals as you return it, as that could result in you receiving a shock. If the terminals on the battery appear to be oxidized or rusted, use a steel tooth brush to clean off the connection area before you place the battery back into the car.Bolt the bracket that holds the battery back into place to secure the battery. Be sure you placed the battery back in the same way it was before you took it out, so the positive terminal is closer to the positive cable, and the negative terminal is closer to the negative cable.  You may want to purchase a corrosion inhibitor that you can put on the battery terminal prior to connecting the new cable. This can help ensure the connection from the battery is strong and doesn’t become limited as corrosion builds up in your engine bay. Squeeze the inhibitor onto the terminal, then slide the new positive cable connection over it.Tighten the cable by turning the bolt you loosened to remove the old one. Make sure the cable is connected firmly. It if jostles loose while you are driving the car will turn off.  Remember that connecting the negative battery cable will complete the car’s circuit and reestablish power to the vehicle. Be sure all other connections are tight before completing this step. You may also want to use the corrosion inhibitor on the negative terminal. Once the negative cable is connected, the car can be started again.Be careful when touching the negative cable to the terminal and it may produce some sparks. Tighten the cable down securely so you can be sure it won’t jiggle loose.  Make sure you attached the cable properly by starting the car. If the car fails to turn over, one of the cables may not be properly fastened and the electricity is not reaching the starter. If the car attempts to turn over but can’t quite start, your battery may not have enough charge. If the car fails to start, recheck where the cables are connected on both ends.If the cables are installed properly and secured, remove the battery again and take it to your local auto parts store. They can test and charge the battery to ensure it’s still good. If the cables were loose at all, tighten them and try again. If the car starts fine, you’re all done!	Put on safety glasses and gloves. Ensure the car is turned off. Locate the battery. Determine which is the positive and which is the negative terminal. Remove boxes or tape covering the end of the cable. Disconnect the negative cable. Disconnect the positive cable. Remove the battery. Remove the negative cable, then the positive. Compare the new and old cables. Prepare the new cables for installation. Attach the positive cable to the starter. Attach the negative cable to the body or block. Place the battery back in the car. Connect the positive battery cable to the battery. Connect the negative cable. Start the car.

Theatre kids are known for being themselves and not caring about the judgment of others.   While that is certainly not true of everyone, acceptance of themselves is a goal that theatre kids work towards. You can be any height, weight, do your hair however you’d like- diversity is key. Because theatre kids strive to be themselves, they do not feel pressured to wear designer clothes or popular mall labels. It is the art that matters, so when it comes to clothes they are like any other kids. While preppy certainly isn’t the norm, you won’t be judged if you dress like it as long as you don’t have the stereotypical prep attitude that many attribute to that style. Comfort, in a presentable and laid back way, is key because much of the time you will be in rehearsal or in a class perfecting your craft. T shirts, jeans, converse, dance pants, flats- things like this. It’s not to say theatre girls don’t love heels, they do, but it’s just not convenient for rehearsal. Outside of the theater though, they are just like every other kid. Also, it is unappreciated by true theatre kids when others try to be accepted into the group just because they dress in a stereotypical manner. Theatre kids don’t all wear cartoon or comic tees or shirts with “witty” sayings, in fact, few do. These ideas only came about because the negative stereotype is “weird.” Also, you will not be accepted as a theatre kid just because you wear the shirt from your favorite musical. They don’t care how much you like “Wicked,” it is the dedication they want to see.; , Well, not literally. But hey, if you feel like it, do it. Like I said in the step above, theatre kids work at being themselves. If you feel like being a bit crazy, be crazy, and if you feel like sitting by yourself with your iPod or reading a book- you can do that too. As far as literally singing, theatre kids do that =) Feel free, be loud, sound pretty, sound awful; it’s great stress relief. While it’s true that many theatre kids do love musicals and classic music like the Beatles, everyone is different. So while you may find some who shun the mainstream radio, you’ll find just as many who love it and many in-between. Just be prepared that theatre kids love diversity in their music, do not judge their tastes. If you don’t like it, don’t listen.  It is extremely apparent when you are not committed. Many kids who do theatre, in your school for instance, may have other interests; maybe some terms they do sports after school instead of the play. It's perfectly fine to do that, but the amount you are committed to either activity is what will distinguish you as a "theatre kid" or as a really good friend" of the theatre kids.  For many, it does not come easily and it takes many failures to find a success. You need to learn to see the value in small successes so you don't feel discouraged because rejection will happen. You need to have a sense of "This is what I love and I will not give up." Many theatre kids struggle with self worth because it is such a demanding and competitive activity. Just do your best, be happy, and you will find friends and things to be proud of.  It's hypocritical. Just because someone does sports and not theatre does not make them a bad person or unworthy of your time. Accept other's passion as you wish they would accept yours.  If you're in a show, talk about it! Don't be shy!	Look the Part: One of the best things about being a theatre kid is that you can look the way you want. Sing everywhere you go!, Find your Dedication to the arts: The core group of theatre kids are those who have found their passion in the art and are tirelessly devoting themselves to it. Be willing to try to fail...and try to fail again: Theatre, as an art, is difficult. Don't Judge Others: Theatre kids often feel judged by other groups, so don't turn around and do it too. "'Talk about what you're doing!"'
Can you turn your eyelids inside out? Can you shred like Hendrix on guitar? Everyone's good at something, so take the time to sharpen up with a little practice and show the world what you've got! Musical performances can make for amazing viral videos, but there's no limit here — for instance, videos of incredible sports moves, martial arts skills, Rubik's cube-solving, and much more can all achieve viral success.    Examples: "The Evolution of Dance," "Chocolate Rain," etc.  Viral Tip: For the best chance at success, try to limit yourself to things that people can't see from anyone else. For example, being able to dunk on a regulation hoop is pretty amazing, but it's something people anyone who watches basketball has seen before. Being able to dunk over a friend's head, on the other hand, is a lot rarer and more impressive.  Believe it or not, some of the biggest viral stars in the world are people who simply record themselves playing video games, then share the footage with their live commentary added in. These types of videos, which are called "Let's Play" videos, are a form of entertainment that's rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years, so you'll already have a built-in audience if you're able to put out funny, well-made content.    Examples: YouTube channels like Markiplier, PewDiePie, etc.  Viral Tip: If you gain popularity with a Let's Play channel, convert your viral success into cash! For example, some Let's Play-ers make revenue-sharing deals with advertisers, others get sponsored by established video content providers, and still others use digital payment systems like Patreon to take donations from their viewers., There's no beating a cute animal for working your way into your audience's hearts. Cute animals have an almost universal appeal — there's something about watching a baby puppy take its first steps, for instance, that can warm even the coldest hearts. If you have an adorable pet or you happen to stumble across a heartwarming interaction at the zoo, take your phone out and start recording!    Examples: "Sneezing Panda," "Otters Holding Hands."  Viral Tip: Recording a funny or cute animal video often requires a little more luck and patience than it would take to capture a young relative doing something funny, for instance. It's difficult to predict exactly how animals will behave, even when they're well-behaved, so be patient and keep your camera running!  , DIY and "How-to" videos are immensely popular online. Though these types of videos may not be as likely to get you the internet super-stardom that funny Let's Plays or meme videos are, they can bring their brand of popularity. For instance, the YouTube channel "DaveHax," which contains short how-to videos for basic crafts, routinely gets hundreds of thousands of views per video (sometimes even several million.)Examples: "Life Hack" videos, "WonderHowTo" videos, etc.  Viral Tip: For maximum popularity, you'll want to address problems that lots of people have a hard time dealing with. For example, common computer performance issues like slow loading times, bad Wi-Fi connections, and so on are among the very most common customer support issues., It's amazing how quickly pop culture that seems cutting-edge at the time becomes embarrassingly dated. Older music, fashion, TV shows, and so on can be absolutely cringe-inducing with a decade or two of hindsight. Unearthing an old, forgotten gem of retro cheese and uploading it to the internet can be an unorthodox path to viral success, but it's one that can truly pay off if you hit the jackpot — consider how the practice of "Rickrolling" became a cultural touchstone based off of a decades-old music video by Rick Astley.    Examples: "Rickroll" videos, "Super Bowl Shuffle" clips, "Everything Is Terrible," etc.  Viral Tip: Though every decade has its fair share of cheese, for many, the neon-soaked 1980s take the cake. Try watching forgotten 80s junk-cinema classics like Miami Connection for a taste of just how corny the Reagan years seem today.	Show off an amazing talent. Make a "Let's Play.", Show the world an especially funny or cute animal. Teach your audience how to do something amazing. Dig up something tacky from the past.
For this bracelet, you will need thin leather strips or chords, leather or fabric glue, a needle, and embroidery floss in multiple colors. You will also need scissors to cut both the leather and the thread. Clasps are optional.  Wrap a single piece of leather around your wrist, and add 2-3 extra inches to the length. The extra leather will be used to tie the ends together when the bracelet is completed. Cut the leather to size.  Tape down one end of the strip to a table top, about two inches from the end.  Dab a bit of glue to the leather, and then wrap a piece of embroidery floss around it. Wrap the embroidery floss tightly around the strip for as long as you would like, before switching to your next color. When you finish, add another dab of glue and cut off the excess embroidery floss.  Follow the same process as above by dabbing on a bit of glue to the leather, and then wrapping a new color of embroidery floss around the strip. Continue wrapping the floss as far as you would like, and then dab on some more glue and cut off the excess.  Add as much floss as you would like to your bracelet to give it a bit of color. You may choose to wrap the entire leather strip, or only a bit of it; the choice is up to you!  , When you've added as much thread to your bracelet as you would like, thread the end of the floss through a needle, and cut off all of the string except for about 1 inch. Thread the needle under the embroidery floss that you've already wrapped around the leather. Pull the needle out the other side, leaving the tail end of the thread hidden under the wrappings.  If you want to add clasps to your bracelet, attach them to the ends of the leather strands at this point. Otherwise, simply tie the ends together around your wrist, and you're finished!	Select your supplies. Measure and cut the leather. Secure the leather. Begin wrapping your thread. Add additional colors. Continue the pattern. Finish off the embroidery floss section. Finish off the bracelet.
Different emotions, maybe, but not definitely. Know how they are feeling before blaming them.; , If they are just learning to drive, they may be scared to be driving. If they are experienced at driving, maybe they are making plans to move out. Do they have a job? Are they paying for their own insurance?  , It's quite likely that they have TONS, and remember to keep the door open for future questions!  , Be tactful however. Don't yell at them and then tell them how to do something, rather show them how something has helped you.  Is the price too high for you to handle? Why not suggest that they get a job. Tell them that driving is a privilege, and that if they want that privilege to continue, they have to be responsible and earn it through their work, just as an adult would have to. This will teach them budgeting skills for the future.  Maybe your teenage driver could take a bit of your load! On the way to school, they can take their siblings to their school also. Just remember, if this is going to make the older child late for school/work, that this may not be an option. Do not put a burden on the young adult that they may not be able to handle.  If not, this can obviously be a very difficult situation. See if you can help the teenager to get a job (if they do not already have one.) then, drive them to work for a few weeks (or months, if need be) so that they have enough money to get a car. Or, maybe you could get them a car, then they can drive themselves to work, and they can pay the monthly payments for the car. That would take the majority of the cost (aside from the down-payment) off of your shoulders, but would give the starting grounds for the teenager.  Well, if they have their own car, pay for their insurance, and have a job, there isn't a TON you can do. However, you can assure them that bad behavior leads to bad ends. Are their grades low? Are they hanging out with the wrong people? Are they staying out too late? Discuss it with them. Driving is a privilege, a privilege that you can take away from them. Be ready to compromise your own standards. STICK TO IT! Give them a curfew if they are staying out too late. If they can stick to it for 2 months, then you give them an hour and a half later curfew. If they are hanging with the wrong crowd, tell them that you will be inquiring where they will be going for the next two months, and that you will be popping in whenever you feel like doing so. Are their grades low? Tell them that they will not be allowed to go out past X time until they get their grades up to your standards.  If they get their licence the soonest possible, they will have only two more years that they have to spend with you, (in the US,) so if you upset them too much, what can you expect? They will just want to get out of there as soon as possible. And you don't want that, do you?  , Put a sticky note on their dashboard saying "____, be at home at _:__ tonight, I need to talk to you. Love, Mom (or whatever title works).	Know that the teenage driver is experiencing a flood of emotions/thoughts just as you are. Try discussing the scenario with them. See if they have any questions that you may be able to answer. Give them some tips. Are you paying for their insurance?, Do you have other children that you are constantly taking places?, Does your teenage driver have their own car?, Is your teenager abusing his/her new-found freedom?, Do not EVER yell at, criticize, or lie to a teenager. DISCUSS the situation with them.

Jack up car and securely block for safe undercarriage work.Starting on the top of the 5.0, disconnect electrical plugs for EFI, drain and remove Radiator, jack and secure transmission, remove engine mount bolts, remove bell housing bolts including starter.; , Depending on the amount of miles the sale of this engine may pay for some or all of the aftermarket parts needed. , You can find the EFI set up at any auto wrecker, it is usually found in a 1ton Ford Van, or 1/2ton f-150. If You go with the carb, Jegs, Summit, Ebay, and other internet sites and stores handle these parts. Be diligent, as there are a lot of parts out there but some are only for 5.0 and some only 351w.  It will already have the EFI intake. You will be able to use the 5.0 Motor Mounts, exhaust headers (stock manifolds from the 5.0 are to restrictive) if your engine has the stock 351w exhaust manifolds, you would be better off buying headers as they add 10-15extra HP.  Either buy the Ford Racing 351w Kit, or find a 1987-91 oil pan out of a Thunderbird and order a pick up tube, and dipstick.   28oz external Balanced Flywheel and matching Harmonic Balancer(This is very important **The 5.0 flywheel WILL NOT WORK!it is a 50oz!) FRP 351w Swap Oil Pan Kit 1"3/8 Tube Headers or Long tube 351w Headers, 351w Mustang Fox Engine Mounts (solid lowering mounts) Aluminum 4brl Manifold (custom) HEI 351w Distributor, Accel  8mm yellow wires  The 351w will sit 1"1/2 Higher so a hood scoop may be needed.  Line the trans and the engine up, make sure not to force it together as the pilot bearing is small and breakable,  , Not all things will work, at this point you would've either set up a pulley system so the alt and steering pump should be already installed. Don't install engine until you figure out your belt system. For example, you can go old school with double V belts but a complete auto wrecker base should have come with a complete set up if not this could trouble you at completion.  If you went with the EFI it will be a little challenging hooking up the EFI but should be a snap together as Ford used the same injector plugs on all engine. Distributor should plug into stock distributor harness, but if you go with the HEI dist, a hot wire to the ignition will have to be made.  Top up fluids, check ground wires, check clamps and bolts for tightness,	Disconnect battery and remove. Using engine hoist, pull out the 5L and store.Now this gives you time and space to clean and prep engine bay, tie up loose wires and paint to your desired color,  , Look at your budget: Do you want EFI or carbureted?, If you have your 351w on the engine stand, see if it is a newer 351w. The oil pan, now here is where it gets tricky. Once you have dressed the new parts on the engine, it's time to hoist this Bad Boy into its new home!, Once the engine mounts have been secured, bolt on headers, install rad and hoses. You will have to use a fuel pressure regulator if you are using a carb and some extra wiring issues. Trouble shooting at this step is usually what's next.
Also called muffler straps, muffler hangers are thick rubber loops. Your exhaust system may require more than 1 hanger, so look underneath the car to see if it requires any additional muffler hangers. Buy replacements for any that are broken or weakened.; , Let the muffler rest on a floor jack while you get the hanger ready in the following steps.  Some hangers might be constructed into 2 pieces, so make sure to remove all parts of the hanger.  First hang it from the top exhaust mount, which is attached to the bottom of your car. Let the muffler hanger dangle temporarily.  Pull up the muffler closer to the top exhaust mount so you can hook them together. Slide the handle through the muffler hanger, and hook the handle hole onto the exhaust mount located on the muffler. Slide the rubber muffler hanger along the wrench handle, and hook it over the muffler's exhaust mount.	Purchase a new muffler hanger. Install your muffler if you have just purchased a new one or make sure it is installed properly if it is already installed. Remove any old muffler hangers from the top mount and the muffler itself. Install the muffler hanger. Use a crescent wrench that has a hole at the end of its handle to hang the muffler.
This is your opportunity to introduce yourself and explain why you wanted to reach out to President Carter. This doesn’t have to be an extensive introduction.

It's very helpful to have friends with you because it's likely they'll be a little nervous too but if they've been on it before they can tell you how fun it is and how you'd be missing out if you didn't go on it.; , It really helps to look sideways when you're very high because you can still see where you are and you get to see your friends hilarious facial expressions! After being on it a few times you can try looking down.  There's only a lap bar holding you in this ride but it's perfectly safe and if it had shoulder bars it would be boring! When the staff are locking the bars in place make sure you push your bar down nice and tight so you don't slip about in the seat, you will feel safe and less scared. never trust the staff to do it for you, they don't always push it down far enough. ignore what people say about how you feel like you're going to fall out, you don't.  When it starts it doesn't go very high, it's fun if you put your arms up but grab on as soon as it gets higher.	Get some friends to go on with you. Don't look down. Hold onto the bar. Arms up!
Put the grated soap into a double boiler and heat gently over a medium heat.; , Mix well.  Stir in the essential oils, oatmeal and dried sage.  You can also shape with your hands; make sure the soap is cool enough to handle.  Allow to dry for at least 5 hours and preferably overnight.  These soaps are good for facial cleansing and general cleansing.	Shred the castille soap with a grater. Pour in the coconut oil and water. Take the mixture off the heat. Allow to cool a little and spoon into soap moulds. Put the soap moulds or balls on waxed paper to one side in a dry, clean space. Use.
Simply block out the visuals of the movie when you anticipate a scary part coming. You can simply close your eyes or cover them with your hand, hat, hood, or a blanket.   If you want to be subtle, try feigning a slow blink, for which you just close your eyes for a few seconds at a time. You can also block your eyes with a low hood or hat to appear like you’re still watching when you’re really not.Pay attention to the cues that the movie gives you to indicate that a big scare, called a jump scare, is coming. Listen for ominous music or look for when a protagonist is alone or in the dark, seemingly safe for the moment., Block out the sound of the soundtrack to make the visuals of the movie a little less scary. Often the music is what makes a scary scene more of a dramatic surprise.   Plug your ears with your fingers at the moment you anticipate a scary part. Remember to listen for the music starting to get creepy, but you can block out the sound once you anticipate it starting to build to a big scare. If you don’t want those around you to know that you’re blocking the sound out, try wearing earbud headphones or earplugs throughout the movie. You can hide them with your hair, a hat, or a hood. Just remember that this can block all the sound around you, and you may not hear your friends if they try to talk to you.  Tell your friends or family a simple excuse to leave the room or theater when you anticipate a scary part coming up. Get up to use the bathroom or get a snack, for example.   Make sure you don’t use the same excuse too many times during the movie, or be gone for too long at a time. Actually bring back a snack if you say you’re going to get one; do your best to make it realistic. You can even look up online databases that tell you at what point in the movie a jump scare will come, so you know exactly when to make your exit., Have a snack, drink, or chew gum to keep yourself occupied and keep your jaw relaxed. Play with something small in your hands to keep them occupied as well.   You can try squeezing a stress ball, fiddling with a small toy or item, or something else that helps you release some of your nervous energy while you remain mostly still. Distract yourself further by talking and laughing with your friends during the movie, if they’re okay with doing so. It can really help to realize the silly or ridiculous parts of the movie, or simply remind yourself that your friends are real and the movie is fake.	Close your eyes during scary parts. Cover your ears to block out the soundtrack. Make an exit when you can. Eat something or have something to distract yourself with.
Make sure you have a place where your tapers can hang, undisturbed, for at least 24 hours. This will allow them time to fully set.  10 to 13 inch wicking 1 pound of beeswax Nuts or some other small objects to weight the tapers 1 coat hanger  , For this project, a large stock pot will work well as the main vessel on the double boiler. This will be your dipping vat. Use a candy thermometer to watch the temperature. Once the wax has reached 165 °F (73.9 °C), it’s ready to use.  You will need to maintain this temperature throughout the procedure., Each piece of 16 inch (40.6 cm) wick will create 2 tapers. Tie the nuts onto each end of the wick pieces, since the tapers will need to be weighted during the curing process. These weights will hold the wick taut.  About halfway through the process you will cut these weights off. Initially the tapers need to be weighted in order to form correctly.  Use coat hanger wire and pliers to create a rig that will allow you to dip the tapers into the wax. If you don’t have the wire, you can use anything you have around that will allow you to drape one piece of wicking over it, with one weighted nut hanging down on each side.Each side will be dipped at the same time, so the tapers will be made in pairs. Your rig needs to be wide enough (at least 2 inches) to keep the tapers separated from each other during the dipping and curing process.  Don’t try to make your tapers any taller than your dipping vat. Allow at least 2 inches of undipped wick at the top, near the rig. Carefully lower your first wick into the melted wax using your rig, dipping the two sides of the string simultaneously. Make sure your motions are smooth and continuous. Dip and then pull out without pausing. Allow several minutes of cooling. Then dip again.Repeat this several more times. Be sure to wait several minutes between dips to allow the wax time to cool enough. If you don’t, the wax will start falling off the wick.  After you’ve reached a substantial thickness and the wick doesn’t need a weight to be held taut, snip the nuts off. Repeat the dipping and cooling process 2 to 3 more times after removing the weights. This will seal the bottoms of the tapers.If you need a specific thickness to fit a particular taper holder, use a ruler to measure the holder. Then dip the taper accordingly, until you reach the desired thickness.  After you’ve reached your desired thickness, hang the tapers in a place where they won’t be disturbed and allow them to set. Give them at least 24 hours before trying to use them. When they’ve cured completely, snip the wicks to separate the two tapers and trim each wick to be ¼ inch.  Your tapers are now ready to light.If you won’t be using your tapers right away, leave them hanging in pairs, just as they are, until you’re ready to use them. This will help them remain perfectly straight.	Gather your supplies.This project requires few supplies, making it a very cheap project to try at home. Melt the wax in the double boiler. Cut the wicks into 16 inch (40.6 cm) pieces and weight them. Construct a makeshift dipping rig. Dip the weighted wicks into the melted wax. Cut the weights off. Hang the tapers to cool.
For a rose with a button in the middle, you'll need at least a foot of fabric, a hot glue gun, and something to put in the center (like a button, a pin, or a small gem).  Cut out 12 petal shapes out of the fabric. Make 6 about an inch long, and 6 a little less than an inch long.  For each petal, pinch the base and put a dot glue to secure it like that., First, cut out a small circle from the fabric for the base of the rose. Then glue all of the pinched bases of the petals to the center of the circle.The circle you use for the base should be something around 1" to 2" wide.  Glue each of the smaller petals on to their larger counterparts. Be careful not to burn yourself with the glue.   You can either glue the petals directly over the large petals or you can place them so that they point out at a different angle.  Glue the button or other center piece to the middle of the rose. If you want, you can attach a safety pin to the back of the flower to use it as a brooch.	Gather your materials. Cut your petals. Pinch and glue the petals. Glue the large petals to a base. Glue the smaller petals on. Add the button and a pin.
You need to work on your skills regularly if you want to become a fast rapper. Set aside time daily when you can do tongue twisters and perform rap songs. You can practice for an hour or two, but then give yourself a break to rest your vocal chords. Stay hungry, focused, and committed to improving each day., Notice how certain lines are performed with inflection or tone. It might convey sarcasm, irony, humor. Good rappers will still effectively convey the meaning of their lyrics even when they rap fast. Practice using your voice inflection to convey meaning when rapping fast too.  Once you learn to rap fast, you need to learn to stop fast. This gives your audience time to process the lyrics. Changing the pace when you perform will not only add style to your performance, it will provide contrast so your fast rapping seems even faster.   Try saying the alphabet as fast as you can, but pause after the letters E, G, and N. This will help you learn to keep going fast when your instincts tell you to pause, and to pause when you normally would keep speaking.  Rap has a vocabulary all its own. There are many terms you won’t be familiar with unless you study them. If you find a word in rap lyrics you don’t know, look it up in urban dictionary. You might be able to make use of it in the future when creating your own lyrics.	Practice, practice, practice!, Analyze some techniques of the faster rappers like Tech N9ne, Twista and Eminem. Pay attention to the breaks. Learn the slang.
Find a suitable location to construct the tandoor that is safe and well ventilated. Ensure that you have access to an electrical supply if using a drill, and that all safety precautions are being observed.  You'll need 3 terracotta clay pots. Pot A should be the largest, Pot B of middle size, and Pot C the smallest. Pot C should be small enough that it can sit inside of Pot A without touching the sides. A good rule of thumb is to keep about 2 inches between the diameter of each pot. Never have your smallest pot smaller than 10 inches. Many terracotta clay pots come pre-fabricated with a hole in the base. This is ideal and actually preferable.; , Place it firmly on the ground., You can either create 2-3 larger holes or 5-6 smaller holes depending on the size of your drill bit. Ensure that the integrity of the pot is not compromised., Drill holes in the bottom. You can either create 2-3 larger holes or 5-6 smaller holes depending on the size of your drill bit. Ensure that the integrity of the pot is not compromised., Mark 1/2 an inch from the base of the pot with scotch tape, string, or with a pencil., You can either use a ceramic saw or an angle grinder with a ceramic blade. Your saw may get wrecked.  Slowly cut along the line created. Any sharp edges or points can be fixed with sandpaper if needed. Once the base is separated, place it to the side. Do not throw this piece away.  Place pot A on this platform with the mouth facing upwards., Place 2-3 smaller bricks inside of pot A to create a new platform. This platform will be the base for the interior. Ensure that the bricks are firmly placed., Pot C should be placed firmly on the platform without touching the sides of pot A. Ensure that pot C is not wobbly but sits firmly on this platform., Pot B should not touch the brim of Pot A., The lava rocks should be placed in the area around pot B and C. The lava rocks act as an insulation material., Place this piece back on to pot B. This will act as a lid., When the desired temperature is reached, cook naans by simply sticking to the inside, or cook kabobs by carefully placing skewers inside. Enjoy.  Temperatures can reach to over 500 degrees, so be careful as you cook!	Gather all materials.  Flip pot A over. Drill holes into Pot A.  Drill Pot C. Obtain pot C and place it firmly on the ground flipped over.  Place Pot B firmly on the floor, flipped over.  Cut the base off.  Place 2-3 bricks on the ground to create a platform.  Create a new platform.  Place pot C on the platform. Invert Pot B. Flip Pot B and place it on Pot C. This should create a funnel like tunnel.  Fill in empty space.  Return the base piece. Place coals inside of Pot C and heat to the desired temperature.
There are a lot of different types of road bikes available for different styles and functions. They are all, however, made for generally even, hard terrain like city roads or smooth trails. They are the most common bikes out there, and can be broken up into a few subcategories:    Racing/Road bikes: Aerodynamic, fast, and light, these bikes are the most common road warriors. They have thin tires and lighter frames, and usually aren't made to carry extra weight. Components are built for speed on a variety of geography, from big hills to long flats.  Cross bikes: These have wider tires and a sturdier frame, and are built for a variety of terrains, from city roads to bike paths and light trails. They are usually built to handle some weight, so they work well for commutes to work or the store and on short-range trips.  Touring bikes: Made for long, self-contained trips, these bikes are sturdy, no-frills bikes that can take a beating and hold a lot of weight. Because of this, they also function well as commuter or city bikes.  Triathalon/Time-Trial Bikes: Build for speed, these expensive beasts are light as a feather and have special handlebars that let you lean down for minimum wind resistance.; , The main factor in buying the right bike is the frame size. The frame is the metal body of the bike, and it is measured in three key places. While most bike frames utilize only one measurement for sizing, knowing how to locate all three is key to getting the right size bike.    Seat Tube: This is the vertical bar between your seat and the pedals. It is measured to the center of the crankshaft, which is the circular disk that your pedals attach to.  Top Tube: This is the horizontal bar between your seat and the handlebars. It affects your "reach" towards the handlebars.  Head Tube: This is the small vertical area on the front of your bike, measured between from where it begins to fork around your front wheel and the handlebar stem. It also affects your "reach" to the handlebars.  Stand with your feet six inches apart, and measure up to your pubic bone from the inside of your foot (where your leg meets your hip in your crotch). Take this measurement in centimeters, since all road bikes are measured that way.  Multiply .67 by your inseam to find you suggested seat tube. If your inseam is 85 centimeters, for example, your seat tube should be 56.95, or 57, centimeters long. The seat tube is usually, though not always, measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft., You're going to hit the inevitable red light, and you need to be able to stand up with your feet on the ground while you wait. Straddle the bike and make sure that you can stand with both feet firmly on the floor. If you can't, you'll need to go down a frame size.  There are a lot of different formulas out there to figure out the right reach, but the truth of the matter is that everyone is different, and you need to find out what is comfortable for you. When trying out bikes, note the length of the top tube and head tub, as well as the length of the stem -- the smaller piece connecting the handlebars to the frame -- and write down the measurements you like in case you want to buy your bike online.A comfortable reach should:   Let you rest your hands comfortably on the handlebars. Your fingers should be free to wiggle around. Keep you elbows slightly bent, not locked or pressed up. Allow you to reach all parts of the handlebars, especially gears and brakes, easily., The lengths of each tube may mean little compared to your final fit, since the angles the frame is joined at affects the distance between the seat, pedals, and handlebars just as much as the size. Studies have shown, for example, that a longer top tube can result in the same fit as a smaller one depending on the length of the head tube.These measurements are starting points as you go shopping, not perfect metrics for the right fit.   Always ask to test out 3-4 brands of bikes, and try out a size above and below the one you measured for. Your personal geometry is unique, so you need a bike that fits you.  It is easy, especially with curved "drop" handlebars, to get your hands lower on the bike. While serious riders often prefect lower handlebars, those who struggle with flexibility or are new to biking almost always prefer a bike with handlebars even to the seat height.   Flat handlebars are rare on road bikes, unless they are designed for cruising or casual riding. It is difficult to go long distances with flat bars. Drop bars are the classic, double C-shaped handlebars with two front-facing brakes and a variety of places to put your hands for comfort.  Bike racks allow you to pack things above your back wheel, but not all bikes are compatible with racks. In general, road bikes are not made to handle the weight of a rack, though cross and touring bikes are. Bikes that have two holes at the top of the "v" leading from the seat to the back wheel and two more hole in the very back of the frame will allow you to mount a rack.   Panniers are bags designed specifically to clip onto a bike rack, and are essential if you are transporting a lot of goods or want to travel long distances.	Buy a road bike if you plan to ride primarily on pavement. Know how to measure a bike's frame size. Measure your inseam. Multiply .67 by your inseam measurement to estimate seat tube length. Make sure you can stand comfortably with the top tube between your legs. Try out a variety of bikes to determine your "reach.", Know that comfort must always take precedence over measurement. Buy a road bike with handlebars even to the seat height if you are just beginning. Purchase a "rack" if you plan on traveling or commuting with your bike.
You won't need the same level of protection when practicing on a bike, but it's always good to practice safely. Make sure you're wearing a helmet, at the bare minimum, and knee and elbow pads if you want to be really careful. While starting wheelies on a bike may seem totally harmless, you can still take some bad spills and hurt yourself., Start at an easy gear. Two or three is probably best, so there won't be too much excessive pedaling. The hill shouldn't be too steep, but learning on a nice, gradual slope can help you maintain your balance and keep your front wheel in the air.When you're learning to wheelie, your pedaling may become spastic, causing you to fall off the bike. The resistance of pedaling uphill will counteract those forces. That way, when you practice on flat ground, you'll maintain a straighter trajectory of motion.   It's not necessary, but it is easier to practice on a mountain bike, rather than a BMX bike. Their back wheels are much more stable, and the front of the bike will come up more easier. The large wheel base will also make you feel more powerful.  This speed will vary on a case-by-case basis, but you can aim for somewhere between 5-10 MPH.Moving too quickly might cause you to lose control when you're only on one wheel. If you go to slow, however, you may not have the momentum to properly lift the front into the air.  This will require some brute force from your upper body, as well as some powerful pedaling. Crouch over your front handlebars to prepare to pull up, and don't forget to look forward. Once you have the handlebars in the air, lean your weight back and continue pedaling. You may lose balance or not keep it up for long, but eventually, you'll feel yourself sinking into the wheelie for a longer period of time.  Once you've gotten the front wheel in the air a few times successfully, you'll want to start riding the wheelie for longer. When you're in the air, soften your grip and extend your arms. You also want to use your rear brake to adjust your leverage while in your wheelie. Some people keep the rear brake held for the duration of the wheelie, while others simply tighten their grip on it when they feel the front wheel coming too high into the air. The harder you push on the brake, the harder you'll have to pedal to keep your front tire in the air.	Wear your protective gear. Practice while riding uphill. Maintain a comfortable speed on flat ground. Pull your front wheel into the air. Maintain your motion in the wheelie.
Each airline has different physical requirements tailored to the dimensions of their planes. Airlines want to make sure that flight attendants are tall enough to reach the overhead bins, but not so tall that their head hits the ceiling of the plane. Airlines also require that flight attendants be able to sit in a seat and buckle the seat belt comfortably.   The height range for most airlines is between 5’0” - 5’ 1” and 5’8” - 6’3”. Some airlines do not have height requirements, but instead require that you be able to reach a certain height. The minimum age requirement ranges between 18-21 years old depending on the airline. There is no maximum age as long as you pass all medical requirements There is no numerical weight requirement, but many airlines do a visual assessment, looking at weight in proportion to height. In the 1960s, flight attendants were required to be females of a certain weight, and to retire before they reached a certain age. Some airlines continued these discriminatory practices through the 1980s and 1990s. Now men can be flight attendants, there is no numerical weight requirement, and people may continue working as flight attendants until they’re ready to retire.  Airlines won’t hire people who don’t have their GED, but no higher education is required. That said, airlines do look favorably upon people who have a college degree, or even a few years of college under their belt. It shows that you’re ambitious and able to handle a challenge.   Some companies offer “flight training programs,” but this is not a requirement before applying to airlines. You’ll receive training if you’re hired as a flight attendant.  The primary role of a flight attendant is to provide excellent customer service, so it really helps if you’ve worked in a similar role before. There are many types of jobs that count as customer service experience: answering phones for a company, working in retail, or working at the front desk of a small business all require interacting with and helping the public. This isn’t a mandatory requirement for all airlines, but it will help give you an edge.	Meet the physical requirements. Have your GED. Have some customer service experience.
Metaldehyde is a natural compound which is used as a pesticide for killing snails, slugs and other gastropods. It is highly effective, however it is also toxic, so it should not be used in home gardens where pets such as cats or dogs are allowed to roam freely, or where it runs the risk of being consumed by small children., Iron phosphate is a molluscicide used for killing slugs and snails. It is the main ingredient in commercial slug repellents (such as Sluggo Plus) and as it is only harmful to slugs and snails, it is a much better option for people with children and pets., Crush garlic and mix with water. Leave for a few hours to allow the garlic to "marinate". Add to a water spray can and spray your flowers, plants and herbs for a natural slug and snail repellent.	Use metaldehyde. Use iron phosphate. Make garlic spray.
It'll make the project look less daunting.   Survey your current wardrobe for costume components. Anything you already have lessens the amount of work you have to do. Items such as gloves, shoes and hats can easily be modified. Try to match the footwear as close as possible. AVOID wearing sneakers with a great costume!  Ask other cosplayers how they made certain components. It's a great conversation starter and is generally taken as a compliment. See what you can find in a thrift store for a base or item you can modify.  For example, in doing a Jesse from Team Rocket cosplay, you can look for a white turtleneck and a fitting black top and a white skirt. Those can easily be transformed into her outfit.  You may find some sudden inspiration for replicating details, and you might find good materials and ideas.   Take your reference pictures to the store so you can be sure you are getting the right colors and materials.	Break the costume into its component parts. Take a leisurely walk through local fabric and crafting stores.
Bare soil is far more vulnerable to erosion than soil with ground cover. Aim for at least 30% ground cover on all grazing land, ideally 40% or more.After harvesting crops, leave the residue on the soil as a mulch, or plant hardy winter crops.  Tree roots are powerful tools when soil is too eroded or steep to plant. Plant native trees on steep slopes and riverbanks to reduce soil loss.Bare ground around the tress still needs to be covered in mulch or grass for best results.  Deep, frequent tillage creates a layer of compact soil vulnerable to water erosion, topped by loose soil easily removed by wind.Consider a zero-tillage approach using a coulter or other deep planting device.If this is not feasible, try a ridge-till or mulch-till system that leaves the lower soil levels untouched.These conservation tillage techniques also reduce the amount of vehicle traffic, and therefore soil compaction.  Crops with weak roots or that need to be sparsely planted are more vulnerable to erosion. Plant these in strips, alternating with strips of an erosion-resistant crop such as dense grass or legumes.Plant the crops so they contour the slope. Plant these crops perpendicular to the prevailing wind if possible.  Grazing land cannot remain healthy and erosion-resistant if cattle are allowed to graze year-round. For best results, close off a paddock for the entire wet season to allow grasses to reestablish themselves.   This may not be effective if the other paddocks cannot support the spelled cattle. If possible, keep cattle away from riverbanks and heavily eroded soil at all times., Runoff is concentrated into a narrower area as it travels across lands. The points where the concentrated runoff reaches a slope are particularly vulnerable to erosion. You can build a paved flume, or lined channel, to lead the water to a safe drainage system. Build these at gully heads as well.   Another option is to build a swale to re-direct the runoff into a pond. Building several swales along a hillside can greatly reduce runoff volume and eliminate the need for a paved channel.Do not build flumes on slopes steeper than 1.5:1., The steepest slopes are almost impossible to farm on. Turn the hill into terraces instead by building retaining walls running across the slope. In between the walls, grade the soil level to create a flat area resistant to erosion.	Keep soil covered year-round. Plant trees to prevent landslides. Reduce tillage. Protect weak crops with strip cropping. Practice wet season spelling. Control downhill runoff with flumes. Turn a hillside into terraces.

A simple way to pick colors is to draw them from a large, patterned piece that you already own - a piece of artwork, an area rug, or an upholstered chair, for example. Match paint, furniture, and accessories to colors that appear in this pattern. This will give your room a subtly cohesive appearance and will help feature the patterned piece.; , This interior design guideline dictates that you should devote 60 percent of a room's color to a dominant hue, 30 percent to a secondary hue, and 10 percent to an accent color. This guideline helps maintain visual balance and keeps you from going overboard with bright accent colors or dull neutrals.   The dominant hue should be a relatively neutral or low-saturation color. The secondary color can be a bit brighter, and the accent color should provide bold pops of color that invigorate the room. For example, the dominant hue could be used as wall paint, the secondary hue as the upholstery on your furniture, and the accent color for accessories like pillows and vases. Note that this rule applies to all areas of design. Consider a man's suit - about 60 percent is the neutral-colored coat and slacks; 30 percent is the shirt; and the final 10 percent is the tie, where a bold, lively color is acceptable.  There is a reason most ceilings are painted white or beige even when the walls are dark - rooms tend to look much better if the color tones are graded from dark to light as you move up vertically. Choose darker tones for low pieces like rugs and coffee tables; use medium tones for your walls; and leave your ceiling a light color.  Even if you are completely flummoxed by choosing colors for your home, take heart - you're already well-versed in this process through choosing your clothes. You likely buy clothes in colors that appeal to you and match your complexion well, so follow the same rule when decorating. If you think pink clothes tend to wash out your skin tone and make you look sickly, for instance, avoid buying furniture or decorative items in pink colors.  A color wheel, which can be found easily through an Internet search, is a tool that arranges colors according to the wavelength of light needed to produce them. This tool is used frequently by designers to determine how to introduce unity or contrast into a decorating scheme.   Adjacent colors on the color wheel are called analogous colors, and can be paired with each other for a pleasing, unified color scheme. For example, using greens, teals, and blues in a room will produce a calm, cohesive appearance. Colors opposite each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors, and can be paired with each other to create striking but stable contrasts. A bright purple vase against a pale green wall can provide a visual boost that enlivens both colors, for instance.  Small accessories in stark black or white play a major role in livening up your color scheme. These colors define the limits of the spectrum, and therefore they make other colors appear richer by situating them within the full spectrum of color.	Draw a color palette from a large patterned piece. Employ the 60-30-10 rule. Pay attention to the vertical gradient in your color scheme. Take decorating cues from your wardrobe. Consult a color wheel for matching colors. Employ blacks and whites throughout your home.
Start with the owner’s manual if your battery is original to the car. This should answer important questions such as what the voltage requirements are for charging your battery and whether or not you should remove it from the vehicle before charging.Almost all car batteries are 12 volt, but the charging voltage can vary depending on the amount of charge your battery currently has and the temperature., There will be a manual with your battery charger that provides details for the appropriate use of the charger., Working in a well-ventilated area will help dissipate the hydrogen gas that batteries generate from the sulfuric acid within their cells. Also, make sure to keep any other volatile substances, such as gasoline, flammable materials, or ignition sources (flames, cigarettes, matches, lighters) away from the battery at all times.  Glasses, gloves, and other protective gear is a good precaution. Hydrogen released within the battery quickly converts to a gas and expands, this can cause the battery to explode if venting mechanisms fail.Once the hydrogen is in contact with the oxygen in the air, it is highly flammable and can be ignited even by static electricity., These accessories draw power from the battery and should be turned off before removing or charging the battery.  Most batteries will be found either under the hood of the vehicle or in the trunk. It is also possible that your battery may be under the rear seat, and sometimes the battery can only be accessed from underneath the side of the car., One post will be grounded by being connected to the vehicle’s chassis. The other post will be “hot,” meaning that current will flow from it to the grounded post in a circuit. There are a few ways to tell which is which:   Look for labels such as “POS,” “P,” or “+” for the positive post and “NEG,” “N,” or “-“ for the negative (grounded) posts on the battery case. Compare the diameters of the battery posts. For most batteries, the positive post is thicker than the negative post. If the battery cables are connected to the posts, note the color of the cables. The cable connected to the positive post should be red, while the cable connected to the negative post should be black., Disconnect the grounded terminal (negative), then the ungrounded terminal (positive) before removing the battery.  Some vehicles require that you remove the battery before charging, others do not. Follow the instructions provided in your owner’s manual or with your battery.   Typically if the battery you’re charging is for a boat, you must take the battery out of the boat and charge it on shore. You can charge the battery inside the boat only if you have a charger and other equipment that is specifically meant for doing so.Using a battery carrier to move the battery from the vehicle to the place where you will connect it to the charger is recommended. This will avoid putting pressure on the battery ends and forcing battery acid out of the vent caps, as might happen if you carry it in your hands.  Use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean any corrosion off the terminals and neutralize any sulfuric acid that may have spilled on them. You can apply the mixture with an old toothbrush. Alternatively, you can clean off mild corrosion by using a wire brush. Auto parts stores even sell a special round wire brush that fits over the terminals.   Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth right after cleaning the terminals. Wash your hands immediately. Do not touch any white gunk that may appear on the terminals, as this is congealed sulfuric acid.  Pouring water into your battery cells disperses hydrogen gas from the cell. Do not use tap water as it will damage your battery over time.Replace the cell caps after filling. Most U.S. batteries, they are equipped with flame arrestors. If your battery does not have flame-arresting caps, put a wet cloth across the top of the caps. If you have a battery that does not need filled with water (known as maintenance free batteries) or if your battery caps are sealed then you should ignore this step and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for charging your battery.  This will reduce the possibility of damage to the unit from any airborne sulfuric acid vapor.   Never place the charger directly above or below the battery., This is done by adjusting the voltage output selector, usually on the front of the charging unit. If the required voltage isn’t posted on the battery case itself, it should be in the vehicle owner’s manual.   If your charger has an adjustable rate of charge you should start at the lowest rate.  This step is the same whether the battery is removed from the vehicle for charging or not.  There are two different cases for connecting the ground.  If the battery has not been removed from the vehicle, connect the battery charger’s grounding cable to a heavy-gauge metal part of the engine block or chassis. This prevents arcing at the battery terminal and will not run the risk of causing the battery to explode. Clipping the grounding cable directly to the negative battery terminal can be dangerous. If the battery has been removed from the vehicle, you should connect a jumper cable or insulated battery cable at least 24 inches (60 cm) long to the grounded post. Then, connect the battery charger clip for the grounded post to this cable. This allows you to be away from the battery when you complete the circuit in case it explodes. It is also a good idea not to be facing the battery when you connect the charger to the jumper cable.  The charger should be equipped with a grounded plug (three pronged plug) and should be plugged into a properly grounded outlet (three prong outlet). An adapter should not be used.  Use an extension cord only if absolutely necessary. If an extension cord is necessary, it should be a grounded (three pronged) extension cord and be the proper wire size to accommodate the amperage of the charger. An adapter should not be used between the charger and extension cord or the extension cord and the wall.  You can tell this by using the recommended charging time for your battery or looking to see if the charge indicator shows the battery has been fully charged.  Once your battery is fully charged, you will need to systematically unhook your components. Start by unplugging the charger from the outlet., Disconnect from the grounded terminal first. Again, this will be the negative terminal on the battery if the battery was removed and will be the clip attached to a metal component of the vehicle if the battery was not removed.  This will be the clip on the positive battery post.  Some battery chargers have an engine starting feature. If your battery charger has one, you can leave it connected to the battery when you start the vehicle’s engine; if not, you must disconnect the charger before you start the engine. In either case, avoid moving engine parts if you start the engine with the hood raised or cover removed.  This will only be necessary if you had to remove your battery for charging.  Connect to the ungrounded (positive) terminal first, then to the grounded (negative) terminal.	Read the specifications for your battery. Read the specifications for your battery charger. Choose a well-ventilated work area. Put on protective gear. Turn off all vehicle accessories. Locate your battery. Identify the positive and grounded posts on your battery. Disconnect the vehicle battery cables. Remove the battery from the vehicle. Clean the battery terminals. Pour in enough distilled water to reach the fill level on each battery cell. Place the charger as far from the battery as its cables will allow. Set the charger to deliver the correct voltage. Connect one charger clip to the positive post on the battery. Connect the second charger clip to ground. Plug the charger into an outlet. Leave the battery on the charger until the battery is fully charged. Unplug the charger. Disconnect the charger grounding clip from the battery. Disconnect the positive clip from the battery. Re-install the battery. Reconnect the battery cables.
The leak will generally come from the discharge hose at the standpipe in the wall. Are there water stains running down the wall? Perhaps, when you turn the machine to drain, water comes out of the standpipe. Adjust the drainage hose if you suspect an obstructed flow or stopped up drain. Another common water leak can be a bad hose or loose connection. Pull out the washing machine and turn it on, allowing water to flow into the tub. Check at the back to ensure there are no cuts in the hose or at the connections as the tub fills. There are two hoses that are part of the cycle system. Check as it cycles to verify the clamps and hoses are in good condition.; ,   You need to remove the bottom panel from the washing machine using a Phillips head screwdriver. Possible leaks can be hidden under the washtub.  This would make water come from around the top of the washtub during the spin cycle.   Raise the top of the washing machine to check the gasket. It is normally held in place with two clips in the front. Insert a thin-bladed flat head screwdriver and pry the top up. The two clips are at the back and act like hinges. With the top up, visually inspect the gasket around the top of the tub for cracks, dirt or anything else that would keep it from sealing off the water.	Check where on the washer the leak is coming from. Get on the floor to check the bottom and back of the washing machine as it cycles through. Confirm whether you have a worn out gasket.
A bulb holder is a device made to hold a light bulb. It also has two terminals. One is for a positive lead and the other is for a negative lead. This allows you to pass a current through the light bulb in the holder. Be sure to use a low powered light bulb (e.g. something in the range of 1-10 volts)., You should use two different colored copper wires. This will help you differentiate between the positive and negative lead. Use a knife or wire strippers to cut an inch of the wire insulation (the colored part) off of each end of both wires. This exposes the copper wire underneath., Generally, red wire is used to connect the positive end. One side of the red wire will connect to one side of the bulb holder. The other side of the red wire should touch the positive lead on the battery., Black wire is usually used to connect the negative end. Again, one end of the wire should touch the terminal on the bulb holder (not the same terminal as the positive wire). The other end of the wire can be left unattached until you are ready to light the bulb., Touch the unattached end of the negative (black) wire to the negative terminal on the battery. This completes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The electricity is forced to flow through the light bulb, which causes the bulb to light up.	Screw a bulb into a bulb holder. Remove about an inch of wire covering from each end of two copper wires. Connect the positive lead. Connect the negative lead. Light the bulb.

; , Wear gloves to ensure that you do not prick yourself when moving the prunings about.  Spread the rose prunings around the soil of this area. This will deter your dog from entering the area, owing to the thorns. If you don't need to garden this patch in a hurry, the prunings will eventually rot down into the garden; if not, see "Tips".	Prune roses as usual. Make a pile of the prunings in a barrow or container such as the one shown in the image above. Select areas of the garden where your dog has been making a nuisance of itself and ruining the soil or plants.
You shouldn't even attempt to teach until you have several years' playing experience, and have a good understanding of music theory.   You'll also need a college degree if you plan to become a band director at a school, but this isn't as important if you're just teaching your little sibling, the kid down the street, or the freshman saxophone player who just switched to clarinet.; , Chances are, your first teaching experience will just "happen" somewhat informally, when someone comes to you interested in playing.   You might want to get a start by talking to junior members of your band who are having trouble or offering to help out at a local elementary or middle school (if you went there yourself, the director will probably be thrilled to have your help). If you plan to give private lessons for money, try putting an ad in the newspaper.  If you've been playing for a good while, you've probably owned at least two clarinets in that time.   If you're teaching someone who doesn't yet have their own clarinet, you may offer to start them on your old beginner model, so that you're not held responsible by any parents if it doesn't work out and they've just spent several hundred dollars on a new clarinet. #*They'll also need, at the very least, a couple of reeds (2 - 3 strength, for a brand new beginner), and at least the bare minimum of supplies to keep the clarinet clean - a swab. If you're teaching a student who already plays in a school band and owns this stuff, you're in good shape.  Get an idea of how much your pupil already knows about music and ask if they've ever played an instrument before.   Young clarinet players have often played an instrument such as the recorder in elementary school, and it has many similarities to the clarinet. If they've already been doing some playing by themselves or are in a band, have them play for you to get an idea of how much they've learned and what they might need to work on. For a complete beginner, this will be your opportunity to teach them the basics, such as how to assemble the clarinet, how to produce a sound and form a good embouchure, and their first few notes. Bottom line E and the D and C below that are good first notes, as they're in an easy playing range, and they're fingered the same way as G, A, and B on the recorder, meaning that the student will probably make the connection and realize that they can already play a few songs.  With every lesson, introduce more notes and new rhythms. Begin teaching basic dynamics and articulations.   You may wish to find a good series of method books to use to help the student move ahead. #*Encourage them to practice and stay involved with music, and progress through middle and high school bands. You may want to see if you can get the student involved with an event such as Solo and Ensemble when they're ready, or have them audition for an honor band. Keep in mind that if they're a part of a school program, you may want to mention all this to their band director before you start sending in entry forms.  Teaching music isn't a science. Every student will be different - some will learn very quickly, and some may take a little more effort.   There's no set time in which a clarinet player must become great. Just continue helping them along.	Be sure that you have experience. Find a pupil. Help them get what they'll need to get started. Give your first lesson. Continue to work with the student. Let things progress naturally.
Make sure that the refueling door opens smoothly and closes firmly.; , Examine the opening of the fuel feed pipe for obstructions. Clear any obstructions from the fuel feed pipe.  Wipe it with a clean, dry cloth. This will prevent any foreign substances from being swept down into the fuel feed pipe as the fuel is put into the pipe.  Make sure that 2 fuel delivery canisters of appropriate size and type for the race car are filled with the type of fuel required by the race car.  Make sure that the 2 filled fuel delivery canisters are ready in the garage near the pit area. Ensure that the fuel delivery canisters are secured in baskets or by tie down straps so that the canisters can not be accidentally knocked over.  One of the pit crew members will fuel the car, while the other will carry the second fuel delivery canister and an approved fuel overflow catch pan.	Check the operation of the door on the refueling port before the car leaves the pit to enter the race. Make sure that the fuel feed pipe is unobstructed. Clean the opening of the fuel feed pipe. Confirm that fuel is available for refueling. Prepare and secure the fuel delivery canisters. Outfit 2 pit crew members with fire protective clothing.
The first step in cleaning a stamped concrete surface is removing loose dirt and grime from the surface. Use a broom to remove loose debris from the concrete. If it is an outdoor surface, you can use a leaf blower for extra assistance.; , For regular cleaning of stamped concrete surfaces, a weekly wet mopping is usually sufficient. After sweeping the floor, dip a rope or foam mop into a bucket of warm water. Thoroughly mop the floor, rinsing the mop regularly. Make sure you change the mopping water when it becomes dirty., If water is not enough to clean your stamped concrete surface, you can add a nonabrasive cleanser to your mopping water. A few drops of dish soap, laundry detergent, or other mild detergent is usually enough to create an effective cleaning solution. Avoid chemical-based cleaners as these can dull the surface.	Sweep the surface. Wet mop the surface. Try mild detergent.
Make sure it is at least two feet wide and long.; , Now fold it in half so that the side you want is in the inside of the fold. Measure out a foot square (the photo shows a pillow this size), but you can change the size if wished. Cut it out, keeping the cloth folded.  Beginning on one of the two corners right next to the fold, begin to sew up the edge perpendicular to it. Be careful to create small stitches close to the edge, but not so close it runs off the bottom piece of cloth. Continue, re-threading the needle as necessary, along two sides. You should now have one side folded, two sides sewn shut, and one open edge. , You do not want your pillow to be limp, but don't overstuff it and be gentle so you don't rip any stitches. Once the whole pillow, including the corners, is stuffed, thread the needle again (if necessary).  With this side, you need to be particularly careful because this edge will not be concealed like the rest. Once you are done stitching, go over the last few stitches a few times to make sure it is totally closed, snip the thread off, tie a tight knot, and snip off any excess around the knot. Plump your new pillow.	Choose your cloth. Lay your piece of cloth out with the side you want to be on the outside of your pillow, up. Thread the needle. Turn the 'pouch' inside out so that the side of the fabric that you want is on the outside.  , Carefully stuff cotton into the hole. Sew up the open edge.
Black and red are traditionally represented as the color of evil. Evil figures tend to lurk in dark corners and spaces and they often times sneak up behind their victims. Dark or red clothes help the villain camouflage into their sneaky setting. Wearing black and/or red clothing will also visually enhance your dark side.; , Villains tend to be evil due to their negative past and upbringing. There are reasons for being evil and in most comic books/movies the villains weaknesses define their need for power. Take the Harry Potter series for example: Lord Voldemort heard the prophecy that he will not be able to live if - or so he thinks - Harry Potter survives. Because of the prophecy, Voldemort sets out to kill Harry so he cannot be killed himself, thinking that he could be the most powerful wizard in the world.   Understanding why your villain (the one you are portraying) is evil will help illustrate your actions. "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another...if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice. Ha ha ha!" - The Joker from 1988's The Killing Joke. , A villain works to destroy/kill/maim the hero in most movies or comic books and they go about it with ease. Villains are witty and knowledgeable in serious conversations/situations and often times they get away with a trick or two before disappearing to go plan their next move. To be witty and devise tricks:   Watch and study your opponent and play off of their actions. Listen to what they are saying and reply in a tone that mocks them and insinuates power and knowledge. Use sarcasm and cynicism in simple sentences as demonstrated in this quote from Loki in The Avengers: "I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose.", Most villains are extremely cunning and manipulative; they know a lot of things about weapons, gadgets, minds, and/or the society that he/she lives in. Villains warp the truth into their own insane lie; they take what they know, use their intelligent mind, and construct an obscure fabrication of the truth - ending in a result of total manipulation.Take Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness (well... all the Star Trek series, really). Khan explains to Captain Kirk the Admiral is evil and used his superhuman intelligence to construct weapons. After finding this story to be true, Captain Kirk agrees to plan vengeance against the Admiral with Khan (with Khan's promise of truce). Once Khan had Captain Kirk's trust he turned to a plan of his own and threatened the fate of the "Enterprise"., Villains usually behave in a sneaky manner in hopes of manipulating naive individuals to acquire power/wealth/sex, etc. Although some villains gain an entourage, they are very introverted and keep the important features of diabolical plans to themselves. In acting out the sneakiness of the villain try to:   Lurk around and move with a sly disposition. Have minimal interaction with the general public or society at large. Do general things alone and confide in no one.  It's unusual, though not impossible, to find a villainous character depicted as a self-centered individualist doing his dirty work all on his own (unless you are trying to depict him as a psychopath or sociopath - a la Psycho or V for Vendetta, but this is quite digress-able). They often have an army of minions or bodyguards who praise their path of evil and take on the minor tasks of the villains plan:   Dole out diabolical orders to your followers (if any) while keeping secret motives and actions to play out yourself in your quest of destroying good. Be sure to expose your power frequently. This will help your followers understand you have control over them and the evil situation and they are not your friend.  Most villains have evil grins pasted across their faces and they are best combined with a nasty expression. Traditionally, theatricality is extremely important in the art of movie-making. However, some advanced directors can direct villains to show zero expressions on their faces. Case in point: The Devil Wears Prada where Meryl Streep elegantly demands orders through soft monotone voices matched with blank, yet sincere, expressions. But generally speaking, it is important for the villain to show how much they thoroughly enjoy the evil situation at hand as displayed by the character Jack Torrance in The Shining played by Jack Nicholson.  It's always good to ensure that the villain you are portraying has a particularly destructive skill such as word-play, sword-fighting, gun-slinging, nuclear technology, or political power. Any skill, no matter what, can be used to the villains advantage in an encounter against their foe.	Dress evil. Understand the reason behind your evil motives. Have tricks up your sleeve. Have a brilliant yet dangerous mind. Be sneaky and isolated. Remember that villains do not have friends, they gain followers. Develop an evil grin and stare. Define a skill and use it.
Ask a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to keep an eye out on your home while you’re away. It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in.A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations. Do not sacrifice convenience for trust. If you do not feel completely comfortable asking your next door neighbor to check on your home, ask a close friend or family member. Remember to return the favor and offer to do the same for them when they are on vacation.  Overgrown lawns or driveways full of snow are surefire giveaways that the homeowner isn’t at home.   Be mindful of your friend’s time and offer compensation for these chores. For example, if the neighbor that you’ve asked to keep an eye on things has a teenage son or daughter, offer to pay their child to complete these tasks. Always return the favor and offer to do the same when they go away on vacation.  Interior lights signal that someone is at home but leaving your lights on all the time while you are away is not cost effective. A programmable light switch will turn on select lights at a certain time and then turn them off. This saves money, is energy efficient, and is a useful deterrent.   An intruder who is watching your home closely may notice that the lights go on and off at certain times every day. Set a schedule for your timers that varies day by day., Never post on social media that you are leaving for a vacation. Avoid posting pictures from your vacation while you are still away, checking in at the airport or your vacation destination, or updating your friends about your vacation.   Internet safety is extremely important. Many burglars learn about their potential victims through social media when they post that they will be away, how long they’ll be away, and where they’re going., Notify the post office that you will be away so they do not leave mail and packages at your door. You can also ask your neighbor to collect your mail for you if you prefer not to stop your mail altogether.   Avoid scheduling deliveries, like those for online shopping, for times when you are away. Packages that are left outside your front door are easily stolen and alert others that you are out of town.  This applies to your curtains, your blinds, or shutters that cover your windows. If you typically leave your blinds open during the day, consider leaving them open when you are away. Noticeable changes can alert others that you aren’t home, like if your curtains are pulled shut for two weeks straight when they are normally open.	Ask a friend to monitor your home. Ask a friend to maintain your yard. Install programmable light switches. Do not post online. Stop your mail. Leave window coverings the same.
Put keys that went to old vehicles in one pile, keys to former residences in another, etc. If you come across “mystery” keys, you may as well toss them now.; , For example, if you want to design a special anniversary gift for your parents, find old keys they used through the years, displaying the keys with the most significance.  A shallow shadow box will hold keys nicely on display and provide you with room to write or type the key origin. Or, you could mount the keys on a board or canvas. Determine how you’d like to display them based on room design and the owner’s taste.	Organize old keys into piles. Determine what kind of artwork you’d like to create. Consider how you’d like to display the keys and tell your story.
Volunteer opportunities to get experience being a band roadie may not be as difficult to find as you may think. While getting a job on the road with no experience is unlikely to happen, it's possible that you could volunteer at other places that will give you the similar experience. Go to local theaters and talk directly with staff. Inquire if you could volunteer your time and work on the job. They may be more convinced if you have some level of prior experience.   Many music camps are also looking for volunteers to perform basic roadie tasks like breaking down lighting equipment and fixing and operating sound equipment for the camp.You can say something like, "Hey, my name's Garrett. I was wondering if you guys needed any volunteers or help setting up or breaking down for bands. I'm looking to get into being a crew member and I need to get some experience first."  , Working backstage for a musical performance in your school will give you the practical experience to help a band during a performance. Register to become part of the stage crew. Take opportunities to work on the stage crew and learn everything that you can. The more versatile you are, the more likely that you can eventually land a position working with a band that tours.   On stage crew you can learn things like sound prep, lighting, makeup, and managing., Many tour roadies begin their career with a local band.Smaller bands may not always have the money to pay roadies, so they are less likely to expect you to have a lot of experience. If you do well and have good chemistry with the band, they may want to take you with them when they go on tour.   Even if they don't end up going on tour, you'll still get valuable experience that you can use as leverage when looking for a paid job.  If you get a job in sound or lighting, it's possible that the group you're working for will request something that's unsafe or not technically or financially feasible. In these cases, it's best to be as transparent as you can with them. Part of your job is being able to find solutions to complex problems or issues, but the other part of your job is to be a knowledgeable, reliable, and safe   Instead of saying that it can't be done, try to come up with a compromise or solution that can satisfy the producers or performers. For instance, you can say something like "A suspended dragon probably won't be possible on the schedule we are trying to keep, but I've thought of a solution. Instead of having a physical dragon, we can do a projection of a dragon behind you to simulate it."	Volunteer your time. Work backstage for your high school or college theater. Reach out to local bands. Inform the creatives of technical limitations.
Consider having a few in easy to reach locations and make sure everyone in your household knows how to use them. Keep one in the basement, one in the kitchen, and one elsewhere in the house, like near the sleeping quarters. They're good for several years, but get them tested out regularly and recharged to make sure they'll be ready when you need them.  Check your fire alarms every month to make sure the batteries are in good condition and change them out regularly. Having the right warning system in place can give important extra minutes that can be the difference between an inconvenience and a disaster.  Never overload outlets or power strips with chords. Avoid plugging in more chords than an outlet can handle to eliminate the possibility of dangerous electrical fires. Regularly unplug unused appliances to avoid needless circuits.   Use space heaters wisely. Keep flammable clothing and other substances clear of space heaters and other devices that might catch things on fire.  More than one-third of home fires begin with candles. Please remember not to leave candles unattended and make sure they're far enough from drapes and other cloth that could start a fire. Always put them out safely and make sure candles are entirely out before you leave them unattended.   Consider using battery or electric-operated heaters in lieu of open flame candles. You can get all the aromatic benefits of burning candles without the risk of fire.	Always keep a good quality fire extinguisher in your house. Keep your fire alarms in good working order. Maintain your electrical appliances regularly. Be careful with candles.
Then it's off with the saddle. When you remove the Allen bolts, firmly push the riders backpad rearwards until the two white tabs at the front of the saddle clear the shelter bracket.; , Check that the rubber spacers under the saddle (where the bolts go through) are still in place. Tip; Use plenty of soft cloths to cover any panels that are even remotely at risk from falling bolts, screwdrivers etc. GL1800 plastics are even more expensive than those for older Goldwing models.  Note that the bottom two are fine threads and shouldn't be mixed up with the self tappers, unless you really like ruining Goldwing parts. ,, Tip; The middle bolt is different to the other ones, don't mix them up.   The trunk mouldings and lower cover have to be removed as well. First picture shows the side trim screws to be removed (highlighted), the two screws under them are for the lower cover and should be removed as well.  Pull the side trims off. Second picture shows the screws to be removed for the long trim to be unclipped.   Third picture shows the remaining screws that hold the lower cover in place. Slide the cover (carefully) towards the rear of the bike and free of the trunk & saddlebag levers.  Disconnect the bulb holders and pull the wires down through the holes in the trunk.   Second picture shows the large connector block to disconnect and picture three shows the other connectors to be unhooked. You can see where the Electrical Connections accessory (fitted between the blue connector block) that allows the trunk brake light to act as a running light as well.  At this point, if you have the Hondaline passenger audio controller fitted, you should remove the trunk pockets by taking out the three screws inside the trunk, right behind each pocket.   Last picture shows two of the trunk mounting bolts removed, the other two are just at the rear and out of view in this picture. Don't forget to pull out the helmet holder knobs, they usually pop out easily enough. Take a good look and note how the wires are routed so you don't get it wrong at reassembly time.  Our lunchtime football came in handy and kept the trunk from going too far forward onto the Goldwings frame. ,,, Repeat on the left side. Then drill the holes. Don't forget to put the grommets back.  I've also drilled the hole on the right side as I was fitting the Hondaline CB radio at the same time as the Hondaline CD player. Honda have the positions of the holes marked precisely. Tip; If you are fitting the old type mounts, you don't need to remove the trunk to drill the hole. With the saddle removed, you can get a 28mm holesaw and heat it with a butane torch and just melt the hole in the trunk.  First picture shows the left side bracket sitting loosely and below that you can just see the cardboard F template sitting astride the frame member.   Second picture is the view from the inside and you can see better where the bracket must touch the template. Make sure the bracket is fitted the right way around as shown, otherwise it won't fit through the 22mm holes you drilled earlier. Fit the clamp to the bottom of the bracket and bolt it in position. Repeat for the bracket on the right side.  The CD unit is easy to screw into the cage so no need for pictures of that. Use the big chromed Allen bolts (highlighted in green) to screw the cage onto the visible mounting brackets (now you know why you had to drill the four 22mm holes) that you fitted earlier. The two small brass-coloured self tappers just behind the front chrome bolts will need to be removed and binned for the unit to open. Put a small dab of grease on the spring clip each side and on the two holes (highlighted in red) for the cover to slide along. You can see the CB radio that I was fitting as well. The wire harness for the CD player harness goes through the hole you drilled.  Once it's in place you can close the unit and fit the large chrome Allen bolts. Job done.   Tip: Before you bolt the cover down, make sure that the hinged flap (where it meets the trunk) is turned upwards as shown in the second picture, rather than down, or it will most certainly break off in record time.  When you've connected everything up, test the operation of the CD player before refitting the saddle to the Goldwing.	First disconnect the battery. Then just lift the front up and away from the Goldwing. Inside the trunk, remove the five screws holding the lock mechanism cover in place. Disconnect the two saddlebag cables from the mechanism.  , Number plate and bracket off, then the five bolts holding the rear fender (all highlighted in green).  , Unclip the fender. Repeat this on the other side of the trunk. Remove the three nuts holding the trunk lights in place and pull the lights out. Unclip any cable ties that you can see. These two pictures show the trunk tipped forward. Standing at the rear of the bike and looking at the trunk base, you can see the rubber grommet (right side) to be removed in the first picture.  , Remove the other grommet on the left side as well.  , Position the supplied cardboard template over the grommet hole as shown in the second picture, making sure that the highlighted side is flush with the edge of the lip as shown.  , Then use an awl or punch to mark the spots where you will be drilling the 22mm holes. Now it's time to drill the 28mm hole in the base of the trunk for the players wire harness to pass through (left side hole). Time to fit the Hondaline player mounting brackets. With the trunk refitted, pop the Hondaline CD player and cage into place. The plastic cover for the unit has to slot in position as shown in the left picture. The highlighted connector in the rubber boot is where the Hondaline CD player plugs into, the other highlighted foam covered plug is the one coming from the CD player that plugs into it.
If the file won't download, check your browser settings, and make sure that "Internet Downloading" is enabled., Make sure that you have the newest version of Adobe Reader installed. If you do not have Adobe Reader, make sure that your program will be able to read the pattern files., Every pattern will be a little different.Some patterns will need to be assembled first, while others will need to be cut first. Some may even have specific scaling instructions.  If your pattern's instructions are different from the ones in this article, you should follow them instead.  Some patterns will include extra information that you do not absolutely have to print out. This includes things like other sizes, cover pages, and variations. You can also save time, paper, and ink by not printing those. You can also handwrite the material list before taking it to the store, and you can always read the instructions from your computer., Make sure that the printer is set to 100%, full scale, or no scale. Do not select "shrink to fit" or "fit to page." The pattern will print on multiple pages, which is fine.Pay attention to the layout. Some patterns need to be printed Portrait style while others need Landscape., Most patterns will have a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) box that you need to print out. You can find this within the first few pages of the document. Find the page that contains this and print it out. Do not print the entire pattern out just yet.Some patterns will have a set of arrows or a black bar instead.  These items will usually have a measurement printed on them or right next to them. Measure the item with a ruler first, then compare that measurement to what's printed on the page. The measurements need to match up exactly., If the actual measurements of the test square did not match up with what's printed on the page, you will need to check your printer settings and make any necessary adjustments.  If your measurement is bigger than the printed measurement, your pattern will be too big and needs to be scaled down. If your measurement is smaller than the printed measurement, your pattern will be too small and needs to be scaled up.  Now that you know what you need to print and that your pattern is scaled properly, go ahead and print out your pattern. Remember to print only what you need. Don't print out all of the sizes and variations unless you need to.  Most patterns will print out in the order that they need to be assembled. Pay attention to this., In this method, you will be assembling the pattern first, then cutting it out. It will work just like a store-bought pattern, which comes on a big sheet. This will take up a lot of space. Find a large table to work on, or clear some space on your floor., Most patterns will have little symbols, letters, or numbers along the joining edges that you have to line up. You should match up like symbols with like symbols, such as 1a with 1a and 1b with 1b.Most instructions will have a diagram of what the completed pattern pieces should look like. Check your pattern pieces against this diagram.  Some pattern pieces need to be overlapped while others don't Take a look at your pattern pieces. If the lines extend to the edges of the paper, then they should be aligned edge-to-edge. If there is a space or margin, then you should overlap them.  Sometimes, the spaces or margins need to be trimmed off. If they cover part of the pattern, you will need to trim them off.  If the patterns are butted up against each other, with no overlap, lay down a long strip of tape across the seam.If the pattern pieces overlap, connect them using a glue stick or strip of double-sided tape.Consider applying another layer of tape across all of the seams on the back of the entire pattern page. This will give it extra stability., Pay attention to the different sizes. Many patterns include multiple lines, one for each size. Also, pay attention to the seam allowances. Some patterns include them while others don't., In this method, you will be cutting out all of the pieces first, then putting them together. Depending on the type of pattern you are working with, you might need a lot of space. For example, a long skirt will require a lot more space than a pair of gloves., Keep like pieces together with like pieces. For example, if you are cutting a princess dress, keep all of the sleeve pieces together, all of the skirt pieces together, and all of the bodice pieces together., PDF patterns will usually have little symbols along the edges that you have to line up. Match up like symbols with like symbols. For example, you should match up single arrows with single arrows, and double arrows with double arrows., If the pattern's edges have a space or margin, then they need to be overlapped. If the pattern's lines extend all the way to the cut edges, then they don't need to be overlapped. They should be placed side-by-side instead., If the pieces overlap, join them using a glue stick or a piece of double-sided tape. If the pattern pieces don't overlap, connect them with a strip of tape placed across the seam.	Download the PDF file if you have not already. Open the pattern in a PDF reading program. Read the instructions, if included. Review the pattern and decide what to print. Check the printer settings. Print the size confirmation. Measure the printed test square, arrow, or bar with a ruler. Make any adjustments, if necessary. Print the pattern. Find a space big enough to work on. Match the pieces together. Overlap the pattern pieces, if necessary. Tape the pattern pieces together. Cut the pattern pieces out. Clear some space on your floor or table. Cut the pattern pieces out. Match the pieces together. Overlap the pattern pieces, if needed. Tape the pattern pieces together.
Follow the same process on the left-side of the casing, near the flasher button. It may take a few times moving from right to left, and it will take a considerable amount of force. (Note you can lay the vent  assembly on the dash and not unplug the wires)  , There are 2 clips holding the ashtray assembly to in place. To remove the ashtray assembly use the dashboard tool to pry it off by alternating between sides. Once the ashtray assay is removed the 2 bolts will be exposed.	Insert the dashboard trim tool or some other type of prying device (preferably plastic) between the vent casing on the dashboard near the Lexus Premium Sound System Logo (right-side). Unplug the two electrical wires from the rear of the casing (Image 3). The other 2 bolts are located behind the ashtray assembly under the radio.
Choose a ribbon or trim of your choice, and pick up a thin elastic band in a color         If your headband is too loose, cut off more ribbon and sew it to the end of the elastic. The elastic will typically be hidden under your hair, so it won't be a problem to have a bit more of the stretchy material. Avoid ribbon or trim with sequins sewn in, as they may get caught in your hair and cause a difficult tangle.; , Hard-shell headbands are available for incredibly cheap, at several for a dollar at many stores. They're cheap for a reason though: they're plain. Grab a couple in a color you like, and decorate away! Wrap them in ribbon, spray-paint them, glue on beads or sequins, or add feathers. The sky's the limit when it comes to decorating these bad boys. Plus, because they're cheap you don't have to worry about ruining one and not being able to make a new one.          Use found items or pieces off of old headbands or jewelry in order to be environmentally friendly and frugal.  This is a great option for combining fashion with utility. Purchase two 2" thick jersey headbands from any beauty supply store. Cut one of the headbands in half along the seam. Place the cut headband through the complete headband, and then sew the ends back together (so you are left with two loops linked together). Pull the loops tight and then sew the opposite ends of the loops together to create a single loop, with a knot at the front where the two headbands meet.         If you'd rather not buy and butcher two perfectly good headbands, any jersey fabric cut into strips will work. You can also choose to use old nylons for the same effect. You can hand-sew or use a sewing machine for this project.	Make a ribbon headband. Decorate a hard-shell headband. Make a turban headband.
Rooms that have good lighting will clearly reveal the colors used in it. For this reason, bright rooms might need to be toned down a little with darker colors. Soft, light colors, however, work better for darker rooms.The direction the windows in the room face also can have an effect on lighting. For example, if a room only receives evening light, this will generally be deeper in color and have a golden tint. This can give colors a muted tone. Shadows may be cast by trees or outdoor features into the space you are decorating. Generally, you can expect shadows to have a darkening effect on your color scheme. Use lighter cool tones in this case.  Matching your decorating choices to suit the function of a place can make them feel more fitting. For example, even though red isn't traditionally considered soothing, it stimulates appetite, making it an excellent color to add to restaurants, dining rooms, and so on.Green and shades of this color are great for sitting rooms, family spaces, and even offices. The natural, soft feeling given from earth tones make these a strong choice for places like bedrooms or rooms without windows. Dark colors, like blacks, grays, and earth tones can add definition to a room without becoming distracting. These are great colors to use in an office or reading room.  You'll likely have to plan your interior decorating around some existing features of your home. For example, re-flooring your home might not be an option, so you'll have to make design choices that match well with your current flooring. Other features you may have to integrate with your design include:   Cabinetry, wall color, fixtures (includes outlets, sink fixtures, door knobs, and so on), countertops, sills, and more.	Balance design choices with lighting. Integrate your design with its intended function. Coordinate with the existing features of your home.
Otherwise, you can irritate it. What's more, you want to work with a clean palette.; , Give special emphasis to the area below your eye, nearest your nose. Smudge the eye pencil with a tissue wrapped around your finger for a smoother look. Be sure to let the edges of the "bruise" fade realistically.   Highlight immediately beneath your eye and the line that forms a crescent shape underneath your eye. These two areas get very puffy and inflamed when hit.  Highlight the edge of the nose that got hit (near the corner of the eye) and just below the eye, where the last knuckle would land.   A cream-based shadow may be more effective, but matte powder will work, too.  Use a stipple sponge, if you have it, to mimic a scrape. Concentrate the red on the corner of the eye near the tear duct and at the top of the cheekbone near the outer edge of the eye.  Dab the brush on your hand before applying to make sure you're not accidentally concentrating too much product on any one area.  Add these colors at the outer corner of your eye, your orbital bone, and the lower edge of the "bruise". When a bruise fades, it turns more to this end of the color spectrum.	Wash and dry your skin before you begin. Smear black eye pencil around your entire eye socket, including your eyelid. Apply a coat of matte, dark purple eyeshadow over the eye pencil. Apply some dark red eyeshadow or lipstick in small amounts. Add dark blue or dark maroon eyeshadow to the inner corner of the eye and along the eyelid. Finish by blending in yellow or light green.
If you have been seated at a window seat and are at risk of blood clots, you should tell the flight attendants. Ask one of the flight attendants if they would be able to move you to an aisle seat., If you have carry on baggage, you should place it in the overhead container. Avoid putting anything at your feet, since it will reduce the amount of room that you have for stretching your legs., You should avoid alcohol both prior to your flight and during the actual flight, since it could put you to sleep and cause you to be immobile for a long period of time. A blood clot could form while you are sleeping in an uncomfortable position., If you take a sleeping pill, you could fall asleep and get a blood clot. As such, avoid the temptation of taking a sleeping pill. Instead, you could try taking very short, ten-minute naps., Bring a water bottle with you. When you finish it, ask the flight attendant to refill it for you. If you rely on the small cups of water they give you during the flight, you will not get adequate hydration.  To improve circulation, it can help to take off your shoes. It will be easier to stretch your feet and toes without shoes.  If you have a habit of crossing your legs, you should avoid it during a long flight. Crossing your legs will reduce circulation to parts of your legs, which will increase the risk of a blood clot.	Ask to be reseated if they give you a window seat. Store your luggage overhead. Avoid drinking alcohol. Avoid sleeping pills on long flights. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Take off your shoes during the flight. Don’t cross your legs during the flight.
The personal narrative should focus on a specific event or moment that was memorable or made a big impression on you. It does not need to major moment as long as it feels memorable and important to you. The event could have seemed minor at the time but ended up being life changing for you.For example, you may write about your struggles with body image in high school and how you overcame them in adulthood. Or you may write about your disastrous 15th birthday party and how it affected your relationship with your mother.  Personal conflict can be great fodder for a personal narrative. Think about any strained relationships in your life or any moments of major conflict that you have experienced. Explore the conflict in detail in the narrative.For example, you write a personal narrative about your complicated relationship with your birth mother. Or you may write about a conflict you have with a sport you play or a club you are a part of.  Use a theme as a jumping off point for the narrative. Explore a theme or idea from your perspective. Consider how the theme applies to your life and your experiences thus far. Themes like poverty, isolation, sacrifice, and talent are all good options for a personal narrative.For example, you may explore a theme like poverty by writing about your family’s struggle with money and finances. You may write about having to defer college applications to work at your parent’s business to make ends meet for your family.  Learn from good examples of the genre online and in print. Search for the top personal narratives online to see what a successful narrative looks like. Read and learn from these examples. You may read:   The Boys of My Youth by Jo Ann Beard  Slouching Towards Bethlehem by Joan Didion  Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris The Lives section of The New York Times   , Begin the personal narrative by drawing the reader in with a strong opening sentence. Use rich description and detail in the opening. Start in action so the reader is grabbed right away and keeps reading.For example, the first line in the personal narrative by Tony Gervino is attention grabbing: “I was 6 when my brother John leaned across the kitchen table and casually whispered that he had killed Santa Claus.”, Ground the reader in the story by providing information on the main characters and the central conflict or theme. Tell the reader where the narrative is taking place and when it is taking place. Explain whether the story is about you and/or you and your relationship with someone else in your life.For example, in Tony Gervino’s essay, he sets the scene by providing setting, character, and narrative voice: “It was July 1973, we were living in Scarsdale, N.Y., and he was four years older than I was, although that seemed like decades.”  , Do not jump to different moments in time or move from a past event to a present event and then back again in the same paragraph. Go chronologically from event to event or moment to moment. This will make it easier for the reader to follow along with the narrative.For example, you may start with an event in childhood with your older sister and then move forward in time to the present day, focusing on you and your older sister as adults.  Focus on how things smelled, sounded, tasted, felt, and looked in the scene. Paint a vivid picture for the reader so they feel immersed in the narrative. Try to describe moments in the narrative based on the speaker’s perspective.For example, you may describe the feeling of your mother’s famous lemon cake as “rich and zesty, with a special ingredient that to this day, I cannot identify.”  , Most personal narratives end with a reflection or analysis of the events. You may come up with a moral that you share with the reader based on your own experiences. Or you may leave the reader with a takeaway thought that illustrates what you learned from your experiences.For example, you may end a personal narrative about your complicated relationship with your troubled sister by ending on a recent memory where you both enjoyed each other’s company. You may leave the reader with a lesson you have learned about loving someone, even with all their messiness and baggage.  Once you have finished a draft of the personal narrative, read it aloud to yourself. Listen to how the narrative sounds out loud. Notice if there are any awkward moments or unclear sentences. Circle or underline them so you can revise them later.  You can also try reading the narrative out loud to someone else so they can hear how it sounds. This can then make it easier for them to give you feedback.  Ask a friend, peer, classmate, or family member to read the narrative. Pose questions to them about the style, tone, and flow of the narrative. Ask them if the narrative feels personal, detailed, and engaging.Be willing to accept feedback from others. Be open to constructive criticism as it will likely strengthen the narrative.  Read over the narrative for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Review the narrative to make sure it is not too long, as personal narratives are usually short, no more than one to five pages long. You may also need to meet a specific length requirement if you are writing the personal narrative for a class.	Focus on a memorable event or moment in your life. Expand on an important conflict in your life. Think about a particular theme or idea. Read examples of personal narrative. Start with a hook. Set the scene with action. Move chronologically through the events. Use sensory detail and description. Finish with a moral or takeaway. Read the narrative out loud. Show the narrative to others. Revise the narrative for clarity and length.
If you’ve notched a stud, cut a pair of two-by-four boards so they will fit flush between the cut stud and the next intact studs on either side. If your studs are intact, cut a board so that it will fit snugly between the studs. Either way, your two-by-fours will need to be flush with the drywall opening to create a secure, well-fitting frame for the cabinet.If you’ve notched a stud, cut a pair of boards for the bottom of the drywall opening and another pair to frame the top. Cut another pair of boards to fit vertically on both sides of the drywall opening. If your studs are intact and your cabinet outline is square with them, just cut two boards to fit between the studs at the bottom and top.    , After cutting two-by-fours to the appropriate sizes, grab a bottom board, apply construction adhesive its ends, and place it between the wall studs. Make sure the board is flush with the drywall opening. Hold the board in place and drive screws through the drywall just below the opening to secure the board.Repeat the sequence to attach the other boards.  You’ll likely find the 4 to 6 drywall screws that outline the opening and hold the frame in place unsightly. You can cover the screw heads with joint compound, let it dry, then sand it smooth with a fine grit sandpaper. Then prime and paint the area to make your work invisible.You'll need to patch the screw heads before installing the medicine cabinet. Once it's mounted, the cabinet might make the area harder to patch, prime, and paint.  If you cut the recess into an exterior wall, you likely encountered insulation. If you removed any insulation while you were installing the frame, put it back into place. Depending on your cabinet’s depth, you might need to replace thick insulation with a more compact product.Visit your local home improvement store and ask a sale representative for help choosing a product such as vacuum insulated panels., Place the cabinet into the recess, open the door, and locate the installation holes on the sides. Use a pencil to mark the holes’ locations on the frame. Set the cabinet aside, then drill pilot holes into the frame at the spots you marked in pencil., Put the cabinet back into the recess. Drive screws through the installation holes and into the frame to secure the cabinet and finish the job.Your cabinet might have come with plastic washers or covers to fit over the installation holes. Check its installation guide if you have these or any additional hardware.	Cut two-by-four boards to create a frame for the cabinet. Install the frame. Patch the screw heads. Replace insulation if you’ve cut into an exterior wall. Mark the cabinet installation holes and drill pilot holes. Place the cabinet in the hole and screw it into place.
To do the most basic type of search, you will need to search for the state's DMV website online. Find the "Plate Inquiry," or Request for Record Information, web page or call your local DMV to learn how you can fill out a form to access some license plate information.   Pay the DMV fee for license plate inquiries and type or write in the license plate number. You can find the registration date, the renewal date, the vehicle make and the vehicle year. You will not be able to access personal information like names and social security numbers.; , If you want to access more personal information, but you want to do the investigation yourself, then this is your next option. These services are also referred to as "online information brokers."   Services, like docusearch, charge $15 to $50 per month for access to online information that has been gathered by researchers and information companies. You can save money if you research license information regularly by choosing a subscription service. In almost all cases, the quality of the information you get is not guaranteed. You could end up with a first name, last name, phone number, address or any combination of personal information, large and small.  The Driver's Privacy Protection Act allows private detectives to use databases that track license plates. Licensed private detectives may charge between $100 and $1,000 for this service, but they are more likely to get results.   Hiring a private detective can be a costly option, but it is usually a 1-time fee. Ask the detective to guarantee the information you desire when you agree to a fee.  Similar to the services held at online agencies, these brokers are researchers that can yield results using public records and other services for a fee. Check online listings and the local phone book for this service.	Identify the state where the car is licensed. Subscribe to an online information search website. Hire a private detective. Another option is to hire a certified information broker.
Use a pencil, dowel, stick, or chopstick to push the items about until they are positioned the way you want. Be careful not to overfill it, however. Also, note that these items won't add fragrance to your candle. If you want, consider matching the decorations to the season. For example:   Fall: orange slices, cinnamon sticks, star anise, or brightly colored leaves. Winter: mini pinecones, twigs, pine branches, or holly leaves and berries. Summer: orange, lemon, and lime slices. Spring: Whole flowers, such as dahlia or daisies.  If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water for a special effect., Light olive oil and sunflower seed oil are great, because they burn clean.You can also use just about any other type of oil meant for cooking or burning in lamps.   Consider mixing some essential oils into your vegetable oil first. Lemon, rosemary, and sweet orange are all great choices., Purchase your floating wick from a store or online. Next, take one of the wicks, and push it half-way through one of the waxed disks., The candle will burn for about 2 hours. When you want to extinguish it, simply place the jar lid on top. Eventually, the wick will burn completely. When that happens, simply insert a new one; the waxed disks can last much longer, and do not need to be replaced as often.Fresh fruit and flowers will last about 1 week in the water. If you want something that lasts longer, use fake flowers. Some craft stores also sell fake fruit.	Fill your mason jar with natural, decorative items, such as cinnamon sticks and pinecones. Fill the jar with water until it is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim. Pour in a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) layer of vegetable oil. Assemble your floating wick. Place the floating wick on top of the oil layer, and light it.
Buy UL-endorsed tape with a built-in thermostat. This safety precaution will prevent the tape from overheating You can either wrap the tape around the pipes or run them along the length of the pipes. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.   While you can lay insulation over some tapes, others might cause the insulation to catch fire. Always read the safety information before installing the tape. Alternatively, you could use a heated reflector lamp in a dry enclosed space. On cold nights, check the light to see that it is working.; , Wrap pipes in foam rubber insulation designed for pipes. Make sure that there aren’t any gaps between the pipe and the insulation. Miter any strips of insulation that meet at the corners of pipes. Secure them with duct tape. Keep the foam dry as you insulate.   Insulation alone doesn’t prevent freezing. It only slows down the transfer rate of heat to cold., Apply foam rubber insulation in the same way you insulated the pipes. Pay attention to bathroom and kitchen sinks. Don’t overlook lines in crawl spaces and cold basements. On especially cold days, direct a heat lamp on the drain P-trap.If you’re concerned about a fire hazard, keep the cabinet doors beneath the kitchen and bathroom sinks open to allow warm air to circulate around the pipes., If you lose electric power, let the water run no faster than a slow constant drip. This is cheaper than repairing a burst pipe. First, start a slow drip on the hot side faucet, then a faster drip on the cold side faucet. There is no need to run a lot of water. Bathrooms can be cold, as long as they aren't freezing., This doesn’t require electricity to operate. It bypasses the drain and continuously circulates warm water through the waterlines. Turn the water off at the main source before installing. Remove the valves under the sink with a mini hacksaw. Use the included connecting joints to attach the valve to the copper fitting from the wall. Secure the fittings to the pipes with a wrench. Switch off the valve whenever you don’t want the water to circulate.   This method requires that the valve be installed at a higher level (usually the second or third floor) than the water heater. Circulating water throughout your system non-stop will also increase your water heating bill., This device uses an internal water contacting temperature probe to monitor the water temperature inside the pipes. Disconnect one end of the existing faucet supply lines. Attach them to the RedyTemp. Connect the two faucet supply lines that come with the device. Plug the unit into a standard wall socket and set the desired temperature set point.   Gauge the effectiveness of your chosen set point by opening cold water faucets upstream and feeling how cool or warm the water is coming out the tap. Adjust the set point accordingly until optimized. You’ll achieve an optimized set point when cool or warm water stays in the cold water pipes or the portion of pipe requiring protection. If you own a tankless on-demand water heater, you’ll need the TL4000 series model rather than the more common ATC3000. During off seasons when you don’t need circulation, lower the temperature set point., Set the home or structure's thermostat to at least 55 °F (13 °C). This will keep the temperature well above the freezing point of water. It will also allow enough warm air to circulate to the attic and behind walls, where pipes are often located.	Wrap heater tapes around the pipes. Insulate all water pipes from cold moving air. Insulate and heat the drain lines. Open the tap on cold days without power. Use a thermal convection-powered hot water recirculation valve. Use a RedyTemp. Adjust the thermostat.
You'll need a wooden frame that can fit around the mirror and ribbon that's slightly wider than that frame. Cut out a paper template of one side of the frame, including the mitered corners. Paint the frame's inner and outer edges to a color that's similar to the ribbon's. Cut the ribbon slightly longer than the paper template. Iron on strips of fusing to the back of each piece of ribbon. Use a pencil to trace the template onto the fusing. Cut the shape out of the ribbon. Repeat with three other pieces. Press each ribbon piece, fusing side down, onto the frame. Place a towel over the ribbon and iron on a low setting to adhere.  Repurpose an antique platter or plate by using its border as a decorative frame for a mirror. If the platter is broken, use ceramic epoxy to glue the pieces together. Measure the perimeter of the platter's central well. Draw the measured shape on a piece of paper; then cut out the shape to make a template. Find a mirror that matches the template shape, or get a professional glass cutter to cut a mirror to the measurements of your template. Create a braided trim by gluing pillow piping around the perimeter of the mirror. Use ceramic epoxy to glue the mirror to the center of the platter. For a more temporary adhesive, use mounting tape. Hang the platter mirror with a plate hanger.  Use stencil patterns to decorate your mirror. Find a stencil pattern that you like on paper. Trace the pattern onto a piece adhesive shelf liner. Cut the pattern out of the adhesive liner with a utility knife. Peel the border of the liner back and adhere it onto the mirror. Use a bristle brush to apply enamel paint over the stencil. Let the paint dry overnight, and then strip it off.  Use a hot glue gun to attach a border of them around your mirror.	Create a decorative frame with ribbon. Use a platter for a frame. Embellish the mirror with a stenciled overlay frame. Create a frame out of stones or shells.
There are several types of swings available. For instance, you might choose a wicker porch swing, a metal porch swing, or a wooden porch swing. You can get porch swings in a rainbow of colors, so choose a color that suits your porch and pleases the eye.There is no functional difference associated with the different types of colors or materials of the porch swing. Your choice of swing is entirely based on your personal preference.; , Chains of stainless or galvanized steel are the most common option. However, if you’d rather have a hanging porch swing with a more rustic look, you could use marine-grade braided nylon rope or polyester rope.Your ropes or chains will likely need to be at least seven feet long. If you use rope, ensure it is at least ¾’’ (19 millimeters) thick. Whatever you choose, ensure you obtain two equal lengths of each, one for each end of your porch swing. If you choose to hang your swing with rope, check it regularly for signs of wear like fraying threads.  You should plan on your porch swing moving through an arc that extends through about four feet of space. In other words, hang your porch swing at a spot with at least three feet of space in front and in back of it. Use a measuring tape to determine where your porch swing would fit best.If you’re hanging a prefabricated A-frame porch swing, you won’t need to look for beams and joists in your porch ceiling, but you will still need to ensure your porch is deep enough to accommodate the A-frame. Compare the frame’s depth against your porch’s before purchasing.	Choose your swing. Choose between steel chains or rope. Give your swing lots of space.
You can do this by squeezing it for a minute or two. This helps because as the clay is heated, the molecules expand, which makes the clay softer and easier to work with.; , You do this by lightly pressing while making circular waving motions with your hand on the clay. It doesn't have to be perfect, it will even itself out a little in the next step.  Now, since this is primitive pottery NO POTTERY WHEELS, sorry! OK, now do something VERY sophisticated. "Stab" the clay with your thumb. Come on, really do it hard! But Be careful to leave at least half an inch thick bottom, or your bowl may break!  , Or you can make it taller by repeating this motion, but not very much, then pinching and pulling upwards. Don't exaggerate height nor width as the bowl may break. There must be enough clay in all areas to support itself!  , Just do what makes you happy!  , Just put the right temperature your package says, and cook for 15-20 minutes.  The clay is softer when first out of the oven then when cooled down. The overall result will be harder if you pop it directly in the freezer when out of the oven. Do this immediately!  ,   Use pale yellow paint as the base. Then do your "Tribal" designs. When finished, you can use the lighter to burn parts of the bowl. DO NOT PUT THE FLAME DIRECTLY ON THE BOWL! This will result in the bowl igniting. Instead leave the flame an inch or two away until the area you're heating is light brown at the center. That's your bowl!	Take a piece of clay roughly as big as your hand, and warm it up. Roll it into a ball. 'Stab' the clay ball. Now if you choose to make your bowl wider, use your fingers to to pull outwards and evenly on all sides. Make ruffles around the top by thinning it out (at top only) and then pinching it together in small units. Bake your pottery. Now when you pop it out, resist the temptation to jab it with a knife to see how hard it is. Make it look old.
Using an appropriate face painting paint, color in the face red. Keep hair off the face.; , These represent the ladybug's "spots".  This represents the division between the ladybug's wings.  Stop at this step if you are simply face-painting, especially for children. The following steps are only suitable if you are also applying make-up as part of fancy costume preparation.  Use black eyeliner and mascara to darken the eyes. If you have glittery paint (gold/red/light colors), apply to eyelids for a sparkling look.  Naturally, the only color that works is red! Draw around the red lightly with black lip pencil.	Paint the face red. Draw neat, round black spots on each cheek. Paint a neat black line down the center of the face. Finish up if face-painting only. Prepare the eyes. Add lipstick.
Your first impression is not the last impression. When you enter a new place, say, your school or college, or even your workplace, its obvious to feel nervous. Don't worry so are the others. you just need to show that you're scared too. They have seen you for the first time so try not to flaunt yourself, instead; be yourself. Think them as already your friends.; , Relations are not sent by God, so try to adjust in whichever seat you get. Making access to other's choices is also important to show you care. You need not argue with someone for the best seat. If you want a particular place for yourself like the front seat or the middle one then just be sure to come a little early the next day. Making tantrums the very first day isn't a good idea to present yourself.  The person beside you or in front of you is seeing you for the first time. Just act normal and introduce yourself, like "Hi, I'm Sasha and you?" or focus on his/her notebook or mobile phone and say, "Good choice, its very trendy." You could just simply comment on his/her dress or shoes or even hairstyle. show that you like him/her. Sometimes there are certain common things that initiate conversation, like the classroom you are in or the boss you are working for. Either way, feel free to voice your opinion.  Rushing with your rambling is always not a good idea; you should also pause and listen his/her response. Try to engage more in their topics and views. When they find you reliable and easier to talk, you will too, find them interesting. Don't think for any topics beforehand. Let the conversation lead you. you will see one topic leads to another. It often becomes smooth when you act natural. Pretence is not necessary unless you didn't enroll for an acting course.  Make sure to offer help when they need one. It's up to them to trust you or not, but you could show concern and interest in them. Who knows, you might get help in return. When you're alone in a new place, you won't know what you need and when. So instead of regretting later, you could just ask for some help too unless its very personal. A helping hand once in a while saves from embarrassment.  It's very rude to not ask for the contact number, especially after the other person has helped you. Even if you do not intend for further communication, just an occasional 'Hi!' or 'Hello! How you're doing?' sums it up. Remember the first person you met saved you from boredom and has at least been a friend to you. Just for the sake of that, drop a message sometimes to show that you remembered. Always be thankful.	Keep your attitude right. Make yourself comfortable. Be the first to approach. Carefully listen to what others say. Be helpful. Stay in touch after leaving.
They may be roses, flocks, jasmine, and other flowers or herbs, shrubs, etc. Carefully lift the plants and keep them up from the ground until you can return them to the ground elder free border.  Unpick any ground elder roots. Keep all the plants in water in trugs in the shade., Rotate the soil to about 9"., Repeat the rotation and raking., Try to remove as much root as possible from within the holes.,, Use a pressure spray pot with the jet set on accurate jet, not spray, being careful to avoid the plants.  Verdone will prove very effective. You should now only find perhaps three leaves in the entire border.  This reduces the reserve root system to such a degree that it can't withstand the Verdone, which is exactly the opposite of normal advice. It should prove very satisfying to have virtually beaten the ground elder pest.	Lift all the flower or other plants that you want to preserve up from the border. Wash all the roots with a pressure hose. Remove the top growth of ground elder. Rake off as much root as possible. Make suitably sized holes for the clean plants.Once a week for six months when watering the plants, pull up any new leaves that will often come up, with short chopped up roots while the soil is loose. When the soil becomes compacted again, squirt any new growth with Verdone. Mash up the roots in the ground into short pieces.
A lot of taxi scams take place at airports, when travelers are tired and most susceptible to getting ripped off. If you are traveling to a foreign country for the first time and are not familiar with the language or customs, you may want to arrange for a shuttle or other service to pick you up from the airport.This can often be arranged through your hotel, and some hotels will even have a complimentary airport shuttle service.  If you are nervous about taxi scams while traveling, you can avoid them altogether by using other modes of transportation. Many large cities will have excellent and affordable public transportation systems. Although at time less convenient, traveling on public transit can be a reasonable way to get around a city or country while traveling.You will also get an opportunity to interact with locals and see what it is really like living in this part of the world.  Another way to avoid taxi scams, is by using Uber while traveling. Uber allows you to order a driver using an app on your phone. It will send you the name and a picture of your driver as well as the type of vehicle and license plate number. This way, if you have any difficulties with the ride, you can report the driver to the local authorities. Uber also pays in advance with your credit card so you do not need to worry about getting scammed for extra charges. Uber is available in major cities across the globe and is a great tool to use while traveling abroad.You will need to have a wifi connection to order a car and track the driver. Most airports will have free wifi, but this may be more difficult to find when you are out and about.  For some vacations, it may make sense to rent a car instead of relying on taxis or public transit. Although this can be more expensive, it will give you the freedom to travel at your own pace. You can also easily travel between cities or take longer trips that would be too expensive in a taxi.   Make sure that you are familiar with local driving customs prior to travel. Check to see that your driver's license is legal in the country you are traveling to.	Arrange for a shuttle to pick you up from the airport. Take public transit. Try Uber. Rent a car.
Turnips thrive in cooler temperatures, so you should plant them when soil temperatures are still somewhat cool. For spring turnips, sow the seeds outdoors three weeks before the last expected frost. For fall turnips, sow the seeds in midsummer, roughly two months before the first expected frost of winter.The soil temperature needs to be an average of at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) for the seeds to germinate, but temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees (10 and 21 degrees Celsius) Fahrenheit encourage the most rapid growth. Fall turnips are typically sweeter than spring turnips, and they are also less likely to attract root maggots.; , Turnips thrive in full sun, so the area you choose should receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily, if not a little more.   Ideally, you should also choose a spot with naturally loose, well-draining soil. You can improve the soil conditions if necessary, but starting out with good soil conditions will make your job easier. Also keep in mind that turnips prefer soils with a pH of 6.5. Most soils will not be too acidic or too alkaline, so testing is not always necessary. If you have difficulty with your turnip crop, though, consider testing the soil pH by taking a sample to your nearest university or by purchasing a home pH testing kit from a garden nursery or home improvement store.  Loosen the soil with a rake or shovel to a depth of 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm), then mix in a 2-inch to 4-inch (5-cm to 10-cm) layer of compost.For added benefit, consider mixing in a few handfuls of well rotted manure along with the compost.  Spread the seed across the prepared soil as evenly as possible. Cover the seed gently with 1/4 inch (6 mm) of soil for spring turnips or 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of soil for fall turnips.   Alternatively, you can plant the seeds in rows spaced 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart. Note that germination usually takes anywhere from 7 to 14 days. After planting the seeds, make sure that they are evenly watered. You do not want to drench the seeds since doing so can wash them out of the soil, but the surface of the soil should be somewhat moist to the touch.  When the seedlings reach a height of 4 inches (10 cm), pull the weakest ones so that the strongest have more room and resources. "Early" varieties should be thinned out so that they are 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart, while standard or “maincrop” varieties should be 6 inches (15 cm) apart.   If you only want to grow turnips for their greens, however, you should not thin them out. Usually, the greens of the removed plants are large enough to use.  Turnips need 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. Any less will cause the roots to become tough and bitter, but too much more can cause the turnips to rot.   Monitor the rainfall in your area. During seasons of average rainfall, you may not need to do any additional watering. If the season is a dry one, though, you should water the turnips by hand.  When the plants reach a height of 5 inches (12.7 cm), add a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of mulch around the greens.   Mulch holds in moisture, and even moisture can encourage better growth and flavor. Additionally, mulch can help control and limit the number of weeds in your garden.  While not strictly necessary, a monthly application of mild, organic fertilizer can help strengthen the turnip root. Choose a fertilizer high in potassium and phosphorus rather than one high in nitrogen.Nitrogen fertilizers will cause the turnip greens to get very bushy, but the roots will suffer as a result. Look for fertilizers that also contain boron or apply a separate boron spray four to six weeks after sowing the seeds. Make sure that any fertilizer you use is food-safe. Instead of a fertilizer, you could apply a dose of compost tea once a month or so.  Any weeds that poke their way up through the mulch should be pulled by hand. Avoid using herbicides since the chemicals can get on the turnip plant, damaging it and making it unfit for human consumption.  Root maggots and flea beetles are among the most common pests you'll need to worry about, while powdery mildew and downy mildew tend to be the most common forms of fungi.   Root maggots are most often a problem when you grow turnips in soil that nurtured radishes, turnips, or rutabagas the previous year. To prevent root maggot infestations, rotate your crops and treat the soil with a food-safe insecticide labeled for use against root maggots. Keeping the soil pH above 6.0 can prevent most problems with mildew and other fungi, like club root. Periodically test the soil pH with a pH testing kit or by taking it to a local university extension office.Typically speaking, once turnip roots become infested by pests or fungi, there is not much you can do to save them. Your best option is to remove the infected plant and treat the soil as needed to destroy as much of the pest or fungi as possible. You may or may not be able to recover the rest of your turnip crop.  As a general rule, you can harvest greens as soon as they are large enough to pick. Generally, this is when the green reach a height between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).As long as the growing points or nodes are not removed, the greens should regrow after harvesting them. If you want to harvest leaves and roots from the same plant, only remove two or three leaves per plant. If you remove all of the leaves, the root will die.  You should be able to harvest mature, ripe turnips after five to ten weeks. "Early" varieties only require five weeks, while main crop varieties need six to ten.   You can harvest small turnips simply by hand pulling them. To harvest large turnip roots, use a spading fork to loosen the soil around the root before pulling it out. You can harvest turnips at virtually any size. Small turnips are tender and tend to be somewhat sweeter than large turnips, though, so most prefer to harvest turnips when the roots are between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 and 7.5 cm) in diameter). You can check the root size by lightly brushing away soil on top of one plant to reveal the root below. If that one plant appears ready for harvest, most of the others will likely be ready, as well. Make sure that all of your turnips are harvested before the first frost. Do not allow them to grow too large, since overripe turnips have a woody taste and texture.  When packed and stored in a cool place, harvested turnips will usually last for three to four months. Consider keeping them in a basement, root cellar, or shed and covering them with straw.   Twist off the tops, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of stem before storing the turnips. Do not rinse off any soil since it can actually help protect the roots wile they remain in storage. You might be able to leave your fall crop in the ground until early winter by covering them with a thick mulch, but pull them out before the soil freezes and hardens. Turnips can also be stored in the refrigerator.	Plant in the spring or fall. Choose a good location. Improve the soil conditions. Scatter the seeds. Thin out the seedlings. Water as needed. Add plenty of mulch. Consider fertilizing the turnips. Remove any weeds. Watch out for pests and fungi. Harvest the greens early on. Pull turnips roots once they mature. Store in cool temperatures.
Serah is mature and shows a lot of wisdom for her age. Be sure to try to be like that too. Also And also she cares about the ones that she loves. Basically, Serah is wise, mature, considerate, and kind.; , Serah wears a red pleated skirt lined with black lace, a white sleeveless dress shirt, a semi-transparent sweeper in the same style of the shirt, black thigh-highs, ivory ankle boots, and a bandage on her left bicep which she uses to cover her l'Cie brand. In the Winter, you can wear a long sleeved dress shirt, a long jacket, leggings, and any kind of boots. In the summer, you can wear sneakers or flip flops and you don't have to wear thigh-highs/leggings. You can add the bandage to get that full Serah effect.  Serah has the same pink tint of hair that Lightning has, which she ties into a ponytail on the left side of her head, much like how Lightning's hair falls over her left shoulder. To get this hairstyle, you can look at a video on YouTube or just take a picture of Serah to a hairdresser. Serah is skinny and has very clear skin. You should try to exercise daily by doing 100 crunches and running/dancing for 45 min. You can gradually increase how many crunches and how many minutes you run/dance when you get use to it. And to have clear skin, you should go to a dermatologist or get an acne medication. If you just have small pimples on your face, then just get something like Neutrogena, clear and clear, or St. Ives.  Serah has a decorated hair tie for her ponytail. You can buy these easily at any kind of store. And she has a matching necklace with her boyfriend/fiancé, Snow. You can share a necklace with anyone who you are close to like your friend or your boyfriend. And to top it off, you can wear a bracelet.	Have that Serah Personality!, Dress the part. Look the part. Accessorize!
Research vegetables that grow successfully in your area. Your location is one of the largest factors in whether you will successfully grow vegetables. You need to do a bit of research about your region and only decide on vegetables that are compatible with the climate where you live. Looking up the United States Department of Agriculture’s growing zones can give you a start in learning about what plants grow well in your area.Start out small. You may want to plant a ton of different vegetables but if you are just starting out gardening you should really focus your energy on just a few.Growing vegetables can be more of a time commitment than people expect, so begin gradually so you don't get overwhelmed. Once you are an experienced gardener, you may be able to replicate the climate of other regions in order to grow any vegetables you like. However, when you are just starting out, planting vegetables that are difficult to grow in your region will most likely just be frustrating and unfruitful.; , In general, choose a spot to plant your vegetables where sun shines at least 6 hours a day.This amount of sun is considered "full sun." If you want to plant a vegetable that does not require full sun all day, then you will need to locate an area of your yard that gets a significant amount of shade.   You do not necessarily have to plant vegetables directly in the ground. Planting veggies in pots can be very successful for a wide variety of plants and it does not require a lot of space.There are benefits to container gardening, for instance you can easily move the plants to a new location if they are not happy where you initially place them and the soil in the pot usually develops fewer weeds. On the downside, however, plants in containers usually need to be watered more often and are more vulnerable to cold and hot temperatures, as a pot changes temperature much more easily than the ground.  Seeds will generally need to start earlier but may have to be started inside, to protect them from frost.Vegetable starts, young plants that have been grown from seed in a greenhouse by a professional, will cost you significantly more to buy, but they will establish easier and can be planted later in the growing season.   Some plants are difficult to grow from seed. Plants with long germination periods, such as cilantro, can be difficult for home gardeners to cultivate. Consider investing in the added cost of vegetable starts for plants such as this. Many plants, including lettuce, are actually easier to grow from seed. This is especially the case for plants, such as carrots, that don't do well with being transplanted. For plants like this, it makes sense to sew the seeds directly into the ground or in biodegradable seed starting pots that can go right into the ground once the plant sprouts., Part of deciding when to plant your veggies will be dictated by whether you are planting seeds or starts. In addition, different vegetables need to be planted at different times of the year. There are many vegetables that thrive in the summer sun, but you can also grow a surprising amount of vegetables over the winter months, depending on your location., If purchasing seeds, pick a brand that seems dependable and pick vegetable strains that seem reliable. You may want to do some research before you go to the garden center to decide exactly which type of each vegetable you want. If you are purchasing vegetable starts, pick plants that seem healthy and do not have discoloration or spots.   Consider whether you want organic or non-GMO veggie starts or seeds. While some people do not have a problem with genetic modification or pesticides, others do not what these kind of processes involved in the propagation of their food. It's up to you. You can also get good quality seeds and plants from springtime farmer’s markets, seed swaps hosted by local organizations, and online seed catalog companies.  These amendments will depend on the current status of your soil and the needs of the vegetables you want to plant. If you have never planted before in the location you are using, take a soil sample and conduct a soil test.There are tests available at any garden center that will tell you the ph of your soil. Soil can go from very acidic all the way to very alkaline, as well as going from very sandy to very clay like. Figure out what kind of soil you have and try to move it more toward neutral by adding amendments.   After assessing the soil, add some compost to it. Compost adds organic matter that breaks down and basically becomes food for your plant.  Take the time to weed before you plant your veggies. Weeds will compete for nutrients with your new plants, making their success less likely. Get all the weeds from their roots, as many weeds can regenerate if even a bit of their roots are left intact.  You will want to cultivate, or break up, the soil in an area a bit larger than where your plants will actually be. The root systems of many plants will grow to be quite large, moving outward from where the plant is initially planted. You can break the soil up by digging with a shovel or using a roto-tiller. As you mix the soil, add in any amendments you need to add based on the results from your soil test.  Be sure to follow any directions on seed packets about how deep and how far apart you should plant seeds. Some seeds can easily grow from a depth of 6 inches, while others need to basically be on the surface of the soil. Vegetable starts, on the other hand, should be planted so that their existing soil is level with the surface.   Remember that some plants can only grow in one direction, meaning that a certain part of the seed or clove needs to be facing up in order for it to grow properly. For instance, garlic cloves have a top and bottom. When planting garlic you need to face the pointy side up in order for it to grow., If you are using seeds, pack the soil back in the hole, making sure that it is firm but not totally compacted. If you are planting vegetable starts, push soil in all around the start, pressing the soil firmly so that the start stands firmly upright.  The first time you water, you will want to soak the entire area. After that, keep the soil moist but don't drown the plants. Keeping up on watering is one of the most important things you can do to make your vegetables thrive. Monitor your plants and soil and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.   If you are starting plants from seeds outdoors, keep the water consistently moist until the plants come up. As they grow, you can reduce the watering frequency to once or twice per week.  Don't just forget about them, or they won't grow very well. Remove any weeds that pop up, fertilize if necessary, and keep on watering.You will need to keep tending to your veggies but once they are planted properly, much of your work is done!   To deter weeds from growing, consider mulching around your veggies.The little bit of effort it takes to mulch will pay off when you are not repeatedly weeding around your plants. Some vegetable plants need to be fertilized during the growing season to ensure harvest because they absorb large amounts of nutrients from the soil. Make sure that you’re aware of your plants’ specific feeding requirements.	Decide which veggies to plant. Decide where to plant your veggies. Decide whether to plant seeds or starts. Figure out when to plant your veggies. Buy seeds or veggie starts from a garden center. Test the soil and purchase necessary amendments. Remove all of the weeds and vegetation where you are going to plant your vegetables. Break up and amend the soil. Dig a hole and place seeds or a vegetable start in it. Cover the hole back up with soil. Water your vegetables. Care for your veggies after planting.
You can paint your mermaid traditional human skin colors, such as black or pinkish. Or, you can have a pastel green or lilac mermaid if you wish!; , Paint from the base of the clothespin until just over halfway up.   Leave the top part bare (no glitter). This will be used for the mermaid's top and head.  This part of the mermaid's outfit can be made in various ways, any of which is attached a little way under the head end of the clothespin (where you'd estimate her chest would be):   Glue two sequins; or Paint on or draw two circles; or Cut two circles from scrap fabric or paper and glue them on.	Paint the clothespin. Glue or paint glitter on the clothespin. Add the mermaid bra/halter top.
Otto Link makes an amazing ebonite mouthpiece for jazz, as does Meyer. Vandoren v16 and Java are specifically for jazz, while the V5, as long as it is open, is a great saxophone mouthpiece. Also check out Jody Jazz and the Selmer supper session, as well as the Selmer sd20 All the greats, Charlie Parker, Coltrane, Cannonball, Brecker... used a jazz mouthpiece. Remember, a jazz mouthpiece should be open, for basic jazz from size 6-8 or 9 should work, for big band music, 5-8 should work and for crazy funk and fusion, 7-11. Don't be deceived by players that you can use your classical mouthpiece for jazz.; , jazz reeds are highly recommended and so is a good ligature. Rico Select Jazz reeds are really good, and Vandoren makes four specifically for jazz, The jazz ZZ, Java green, java red, and the V16. The v16 provides a very full sound. Vandoren traditional reeds also work decently for jazz. Hemke reeds are also great for jazz. Smooth jazz star Kenny G uses Hemke reeds. Many websites allow you to buy one reed of a certain type. Do this for several and find the one you like best. It should both sound good and respond easily. The vandoren optimum ligature has a reputation as a classical ligature but if you choose the plate with four points, the reed vibrates to its maximum capability. Also check out the Francois Louis Ultimate ligature. Try to avoid all rovner ligatures, as they dampen the sound WAY to much and have WAY to much contact with the reed.  It is a different form of playing, less control, more unpredictable and " from the soul" It's about grooving, but doing it well.  Play scales in a different way. Get used to articulating and create your sound.  These are Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (minor), and Lochrian (in ascending order).  Listening is very important for developing a jazz style. Listen to such greats as Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, and develop the style you want.  There's no better way to learn to play jazz then joining some group and playing it first hand. If you are just starting, most middle and high schools have a jazz band.  Get a professional to prevent you from causing bad habits that go into your subconscious memory.	First things first, assuming you know basic skills of playing, a jazz mouthpiece will greatly help. Get jazz reeds. Change your mindset before playing jazz if you already play classical. Learn to swing. Learn the seven modes. Listen. Join a jazz band. Take private lessons.
Before getting started, ensure that you have all the appropriate tools. including beads, headpins, pliers, and wire cutters.By having all your tools together, you can prevent the need to run to the craft store in the middle of your work.   Headpins are a tool vital to charm-making. They are skinny pin-like pieces of metal that have one smooth head end. They can be compared to a very tiny nail, or a thinner version of a sewing pin, but with a flat end opposite the head.All your beaded charm supplies will be available at a local craft or dollar store.; , Once you’ve developed a desired theme for you charms, lay the beads out in the desired pattern.If you’ll be doing more than one charm, position each charm separately from one another. Take time to experiment with the order and positioning of the beads.  Taking the pre-decided lines of beads, thread them through the headpin.If you are creating a color coordinated pattern with other charms, ensure the correct order is followed.   If doing several charms, thread the beads onto the headpins all at once. This will prevent you from making any mistakes in size, color, style or order of beads., Thread the headpin through your jewellery. Experiment with your desired length from the jewellery to the charm. Using pliers, curve the pin in a circle back towards you, and continue bending away from you. Stop when the headpin has met one single loop.Twist the end of the loop till it is aligned with the beaded-side of the loop.Trim the excess pin if you will be keeping a single loop. If you wish to have a wrapped loop, keep the excess for the time being. If you trim and you find the end of the pin to be poking you, simply mold it towards the inside of the loop.  If you’re tough on your jewelry, consider adding the wrapped loop. A wrapped loop is added to a single loop by taking the excess wire from the end of the loop and wrapping it neatly down the charm’s side of the pin.Three wraps should be sufficient before trimming off any excess wire. Always tuck the end of the wire in. Wrapped loops will prevent charms from slipping off and give an antique look to your jewelry piece.	Lay out all your tools. Plan your charms. String the beads on the headpin. Attach using a single loop. Finish with a wrapped loop (Optional).
As with the basic partner dance, the leader steps back on his or her right foot while the follower steps back on his or her left.   Continue holding hands as you step back.  The leader lets go of the follower’s right hand and uses his or her left hand to guide the turn.  The leader gently pulls the follower forward on his or her right foot. The follower plants his or her right foot, which he or she will turn on.   Almost simultaneously the leader also lifts the follower’s right hand and arm to begin the turn.  As the leader turns the follower, he or she steps forward and to the side on his or her left foot and completes the turn, bringing them to neutral.   The count is 1 when they both step back, 2 when the follower steps forward and the turn begins, 3 when the leader steps forward and to the side to complete the turn, and 4 when they come back together to neutral.	Step backward together. Release hands. Begin the turn. Finish the turn.
; , Do not over-pot. ,   Dracaenas flourish with constant, low-intensity light. Do not place them in an area where the sun strikes directly, especially in the afternoon, but keep them out of dark corners. Likewise, low-intensity fluorescent lighting is ideal for dracaenas; more intense, direct light can be damaging.    Because of their low water needs, it's important not to over-water dracaenas. Soak the soil about once a week; wait until the top of the soil is dry to the touch before watering again. If you are in a dry or warm area, you may need to water more regularly. Do not let dracaenas sit in water. ,   Use a hygrometer to measure humidity. They can be purchased for around $15 at most hardware stores.    This helps both to remove dust and to keep the leaves fresh. If the plant is in a particularly dry area, spraying the leaves with water mist can also help.	Buy or find a baby dracaena marginata. Fill appropriate size pot for the size plant with standard potting soil. Transplant the dracaena marginata into the new pot.  , Place the pot in an area low in natural light. Water the dracaena approximately once a week. Maintain a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (or 18 to 24 degrees Celsius) around the plant.  , Maintain a relative humidity of 30 to 40 percent around the plant. Regularly wipe the leaves with a damp cloth. Use liquid fertilizer on the dracaena once or twice a month.
Fill the tray with compost or planting soil until it’s as deep as the seed is wide. Water the soil until it is thoroughly moist, but not oversaturated. Plant the seed, layering just enough soil over it to cover it without burying it too deep.Continue to water as needed to keep all of the soil uniformly moist.Starting your seeds off in a tray will allow you to move them as needed to keep them in the shade and/or ideal temperatures. To prevent the soil from drying out so quickly, set a sheet of glass over the tray to trap moisture. Gardening “flats” and “trays” are the same thing, but may be labeled as one or the other depending on region.  Watch for the seeds in your tray to grow into seedlings. Wait for them to grow at least two leaves that resemble your vegetable’s leaves once it is fully grown. Once they do, clear out any diseased summer vegetables currently in your garden. Then break up the soil with a trowel to a depth of four or five inches (10 to 13 cm) for better circulation.Since temperatures may still be high, utilize the shade cast by any summer vegetables that are still growing. Plan to transfer your seedlings at their base to keep your fall veggies out of the summer sun. The roots of your remaining summer vegetables should be strong enough by now to be unfazed when you rake up the soil close to their base. If you didn’t grow any summer vegetables, till the soil to remove weeds and other unwanted vegetation.  Once you’re ready to transfer the seedlings to your garden, check the garden’s soil for dryness. If necessary, water the soil to moisten it (not soak it). Then, with a trowel, dig a hole of equal depth to the seedling’s roots in the tray. Make it twice as wide as the root itself so the root isn’t damaged from contact with the hole’s sides.If you grew summer vegetables, there should still be plenty of nutrients in the ground to feed your seedlings. If not, layer a bed of compost and soil amendments over the existing soil. Dig your holes here instead of in the ground underneath.	Sow your seeds in a “flat” or “tray.” Keep things organized by using one tray per type of seed. Make room in your garden. Dig a hole in your garden for each seedling.
Cut a piece of chicken-wire or fine-mesh wire in a big enough size for all your flowers to fit. Then, slide the stems through the holes in the wire, so that the bud holds the body of the flower up while the stem dangles below.   The best flowers to be oven-dried are compact, with many-petals. These include cornflowers and chrysanthemums.  With your convection oven heated to 100ºF (38ºC), put the wire with the flowers onto the rack. The low heat will dry the flowers slowly; leave them in the oven for several hours.The total drying time will vary based on the type and number of flowers you used.   A well-ventilated convection oven will do the best job. Do not try this with a normal oven. Normal ovens contain too much moisture and usually have a minimum temperature much higher than 100ºF (38ºC).  Once the flowers have dried completely, you can remove them from the oven and set them on a drying rack to cool down. Wait until they are back to room temperature before handling.   Apply hairspray or floral sealant for sturdier, longer-lasting dried flowers.	Prepare your flowers. Heat at low temperature for several hours. Remove the flowers.
Getting interrupted often can make knitting frustrating.; , Knitting is a relaxing activity, so it's best to find an area that makes you feel at ease, such as a comfortable chair or couch or even your bedroom. You can also place pillows and blankets around you to create a cozy nest. Along with snacks and/or water you won't have to leave your knitting if you feel hungry or thirsty.  If you're new to knitting, it's best to begin small before moving onto more difficult tasks. Scarves, socks, and hats are excellent choices. You can look up easy patterns online and try them out. Even if your first attempts are knotted or filled with holes, remember that you'll improve as you practice. As you become more experienced with knitting, you can branch out into different areas and see what you like to make.   If you find that focusing on one task makes you bored, try having different projects occurring at the same time. That way, you have a variety of choices, and you can change your knitting routine whenever you want. Look through a stitching dictionary, and find patterns that appeal to you. Create your own project using different stitch patterns you find, combining them into one long scarf or create individual squares which can later be connected into a blanket or afghan.  Start with easy, basic patterns written specifically for beginners. Nothing frustrates someone more than starting a project, finding it too difficult and then abandoning the craft altogether. As you improve at knitting, choose more complex patterns, such as designs featuring lace, Fair Isle colorwork or cabling. These can help keep you amused, especially with larger projects such as sweaters.  Knitting with other people is a great way to pass the time as you can chat with them while engaging in a relaxing activity. It's best to pair up with a more advanced knitter. That way, you can turn to them for guidance if you find yourself stuck. They can also offer helpful criticism regarding your knitting while pointing out any mistakes before they worsen. Watching them knit is also a good way to learn, as observing another's techniques can help you develop your own.  As you knit, pay attention and make sure that you know what you're doing. It's easy to mess up without even realizing it. You may feel discouraged if you catch an error that lies a few rows back, so keep an eye out for any mistakes. If you feel uncertain about your knitting, look through articles and tutorials on the Internet for guidance, or ask someone who knits for advice. Don't hesitate to seek help if necessary.  Many online communities such as Ravelry.com and others have knitalongs or KALs. This is when many people knit the same pattern at the same time and can get advice on the pattern or give advice to others. Keeping your laptop or tablet nearby and open to the community, lets you put down your work to rest from time to time and chat with others about it. Breaking up your knitting time this way instead of trying to do a marathon knitting session makes you less likely to get bored.  Music is relaxing but don't turn on the TV. Turning on the TV can be quite distracting and cause you to make more mistakes as you get pulled in by whatever is on or even commercials.  There are quite a number of knitting-related podcasts by your fellow knitters which help to pass the time and help you feel like you're in a group setting with others.	Choose a time where there are no other distractions, such as when your kids are at school, your spouse is at work, or your parents are out for the evening. Create a comfortable environment. Start with small projects. Choose patterns at your level. Sit with a knitting buddy. Be observant. Join an online community. Play some of your favorite music or turn on the radio so you can listen as you knit. Listen to podcasts.
Many homes have a water shut off behind the refrigerator. Sometimes you need to shut off the water to the entire house. In that case, open a faucet to let the water pressure bleed off. You do not want to continue until the water supply is off.; , It is much easier if you remove the contents (at least the liquids, which make up most of the weight).  In most cases, this will be a white plastic flexible pipe about the thickness of a pencil. The hose will run from the wall or floor to the refrigerator.  This is almost always the source of your leak. You may need to temporarily turn the water back on to find the leak. Remember to turn the water off again before proceeding.  Be sure that your cut is straight and there are no burrs or extra bits of plastic left behind.  The connector is available broadly. The connectors are less than two dollars before shipping. Buy extras because the water hose WILL leak again before you replace the refrigerator. The connect is a "push on" style, so you don't need tools to make the splice.  This is important, because there may be more than one leak. , You are done. Well done.	Turn off the water supply for the ice maker. Pull the refrigerator away from the wall. Find the plastic water hose that brings water into the refrigerator. Inspect the water hose. Cut the water hose with a sharp knife about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the leak. Splice the two ends of the water hose with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) "union connector" that is expressly for this purpose. Turn the water back on and be sure that your splice is watertight. Push the refrigerator back into place.  , Celebrate saving $100!
If you use a small one, you'll only knit enough to make a cowl, which is a short infinity scarf but you won't be able to wrap it again and again.   The needle size should be at least 4mm/6 US and above.  Knit stitch works well for beginners––knit even rows, purl odd rows. You can vary the number of rows as you go.  You'll need to gauge the final length from the stitch used by making a sample piece of about 15 stitches and measuring its gauge. This tells you how many stitches fit for each 5cm/2 inches, allowing you to calculate the final length desired.  Using your calculation from the previous step, cast the number of stitches needed for the required length. Then connect the beginning and end of the row and start knitting in circles. , Then cast off and the infinity scarf is complete.	Use a very long circular needle. Choose the stitch and pattern of your preference. Choose the scarf length. Cast on. Knit around and around.  , Continue knitting until it reaches the height you'd like.
Ballet comes with a variety of positions for your feet, broken down into five different categories. If you're interested in doing a ballet inspired routine, familiarize yourself with the different foot positions. Each position involves rotating the legs at a 90 degree angle from the hip joint. If you're new to ballet, do not expect to be able to do a full rotation right away. Also, third positions is rarely used anymore as it's considered too similar to fifth position.In the first position, you stand with your legs together and your toes pointed away from your body. You should turn your toes as straight as you can, ideally forming a straight line.The second position is a continuation of the first position. You spread your legs apart slightly, keeping your toes pointed outward.Fourth positions involves pointing your toes inward, so your feet are turned to face each other. Then, cross your legs.Fifth position is a continuation of fourth position. Push your feet slightly closer together., Just as there are different positions for your legs in ballet, there are also different positions for your feet. Spend some time practicing the different placements of your arms if you're interested in doing a ballet routine.   In first position, bend your arms slightly at the elbow and hold them out in front of your body.In second position, stretch your arms out on either side of your body.In third position, keep your arms at your side, but raise one arm up over your head.In fourth position, keep one arm over your head. Bend the other arm inward, as you did in first position.In fifth position, raise both your arms over your head. Keep your elbows slightly bent., A plie (plee-ay) is a basic ballet move. It simply means "to bend." Bend your knees, with your feet pointing away from your body. Try to get your knees to bend until they're directly above your toes., Releve (ruh-lee-vey) is a ballet move in which you rise slightly. It can be done using one or both feet. Push your feet together while keeping your knees straight. Lift your heels into the air, transferring your body weight onto the balls of your feet. You should not attempt to stand on the tips your toes without proper training as well as shoes., A saute (soh-tay) is a basic ballet jump in which you use both feet at the same time. Begin with a plie and then use your feet as if you were going to perform a releve. In doing so, jump into the air. Straighten your legs as you jump and then land on both feet.	Learn foot positions. Practice arm movements. Study how to plie. Practice releve. Try a saute.
Make sure the container's capacity is a little more than a gallon. If the rim of the container is narrow, use a funnel to make pouring easier. Label your container with a permanent marker.  Use white vinegar only. Other types of vinegar may leave behind residue or stain your clothing. This is the best type of cleaner for removing pollen.   Do not use this method in warmer weather. Hot vinegar creates a foul, pungent odor.  If the temperatures in your area dip below freezing, do a freeze check before adding the cleaner to your car. Leave a small cup of the solution outside overnight and check in the morning. If it has frozen, add another two cups of vinegar to the jug and try again. If it still freezes, add one cup of rubbing alcohol and check again.	Pour 12 cups (3/4 gallon) distilled water into a clean, empty jug. Add 4 cups white vinegar. Mix the solution thoroughly by shaking the container.
Edible fairy dust is simply made with sugar and food coloring.Figure out how much fairy dust you want to make, this will determine how much sugar to use. Perhaps you can try this method for the first time with one cup of sugar.   You will also need a bowl to mix the fairy dust in, a pan to cook it in, and a container to store it in. Some people like to put edible fairy dust in a sugar or salt shaker, so that it can be used to dust the fairy dust on food. A shaker like this should be available in most kitchen supply stores.  The ratio of sugar to food coloring will vary, depending on how much fairy dust you are making. Start by adding just a few drops of food coloring to the sugar and mix until the color is spread evenly throughout the sugar.   If the color is to your liking simply stop adding food color at this point. If you would like a stronger color, add a few more drops and mix again. You can keep adding color gradually until the color of the sugar is bright enough.  Cook the sugar for approximately 10 minutes.   The sugar is cooked so that the color becomes fixed into the sugar. In essence, the heat of the oven will dry out the food coloring, making it less messy and permanently colored.  Once cooled, break the sugar apart if it has melted together at all.   You can break the sugar apart by putting it in a strong plastic bag and then hitting the bag with a meat tenderizer or some other heavy kitchen tool, such as a rolling pin.  The sugar "fairy dust" should keep indefinitely, as it is simply sugar covered in food coloring. You can store it in your kitchen cabinet at room temperature.  The fairy dust will make any meal more colorful and magical.   This "fairy dust" is great dusted onto a wide variety of foods. It can be added to buttered toast, ice cream, or cereal, anything that will be made more delicious with the addition of a little color and a little sweetness.	Gather the materials you will need. Mix the sugar and food coloring in a bowl. Pour the colored sugar onto a pan and put it into an oven preheated to 350 degrees. Pull the sugar out of the oven and let cool to room temperature. Put the sugar in a container, such as a sugar or salt shaker. Shake the "fairy dust" onto your kids favorite food.
The best source of light, obviously, is natural light – the sun. And the better use one makes of it, the less lighting you need. Use passive design by making sure that your windows are south facing if you are in the northern hemisphere (and north facing if you are in the southern hemisphere) which allows as much natural light into the house as possible; keep the blinds up, open the curtains, and put in the odd skylight. Solar tubes are a new kind of mini skylight that mimics an electric light fixture in appearance, but channels sunlight into inner rooms and cost less than skylights to install.; , Fluorescent bulbs (CFLs or low-energy light bulbs) may cost a bit more than incandescent light bulbs, but they use a quarter of the energy and last a lot longer (some 10,000 hours or 12 times longer than an ordinary light bulb). Most stores stock CFLs. Although the color of the light is different from incandescent -can look cooler or more bright white - there are new versions of CFLs with "warm" color indicators, which look more like incandescent. New dimming CFLs are coming out in the market already and this will not only achieve the dimming atmosphere many like but also saves energy.   See the below Warnings on audio, environment, and health considerations before buying CFLs.  Halogen bulbs use less electricity than conventional light bulbs, however, they still use significantly more than CFLs. The halogen lamp is commonly found in recessed lights in bathroom, kitchens, bedrooms etc. and it will pay to replace these with slightly larger recessed CFLs. Low voltage lighting systems must be wired correctly, if not, even when the light is off they can still draw a small amount of current. Low voltage lighting uses a transformer to create a much lower voltage than the voltage commonly found at outlets and light fixtures throughout the home. To conserve maximum energy, the power switch must control the high voltage "input side" of the transformer, not the lower voltage "output side" created by the transformer. Otherwise, even when the light switch is "off", the transformer remains on. Halogen based standing or "torchiere" lamps and the halogen flood lights (used mainly outdoors) - the type that have long thin bulbs – often provide significantly more light than needed. The lamps have relatively short lives, create a great deal of heat and require special handling during installation. These reasons make these lights and fixtures ideal candidates for replacement.  Now bright enough to use for in-home lighting, we’re counting on technology and the burning need for "green" lighting alternatives to bring LEDs into the limelight soon. Early LEDs were only bright enough for displays in calculators and digital watches, but they’ve started appearing in the car industry - that has sworn to replace all incandescent bulbs in cars by the end of the decade. In the USA they’ve just begun to enter the consumer market, but still cost quite a bit more than CFLs. However, they use less energy, last far longer (have a lifespan of between 60,000 and 100,000 hours) and are far safer and "green". They also fit both halogen and normal bulb sockets.  At the moment, this can be used mainly for lighting your garden. Nonetheless, these little solar lights are cute and do well at night for lighting up enough so that you don’t trip over your feet on the way to the shed.  Keep your eyes peeled for light fittings and lamps made from natural or recycled materials such as metal, glass, plastic and natural materials like wood, cloth, or even reclaimed materials like bottle tops.  By dimming your lights, you use only a fraction of the electricity that you would use at full power. Dimming not only saves energy, it also extends bulb life, thereby reducing landfill waste and saving you money. It allows the light level to be tuned to your liking and lets you control how much power you're using. Dimmers can be used on nearly all lamp types, including incandescent, fluorescent, CFL, and halogen; although some types require the use of lamps designed expressly for dimming (as in the case of CFLs) or require appropriate hardware (as in the case of a special "dimming ballast" to be installed in traditional fluorescent fixtures. Dimmers are widely available at hardware and lighting stores and are easy to install. Unlike old rheostat dimmers, modern dimmers are almost 99% efficient, dissipating only a very small amount of energy as heat.  This is a no-brainer: leaving electrical appliances on "standby" mode or double adapters and chargers hooked into the wall, all still continue to draw electricity. Switch them off at the wall and unplug any adapters, even when devices aren’t switched on. And get into the habit of switching off lights in any room in which you’re not, even if you’re stepping out for only a few minutes.  According to sustainable home design, light from outside lamps should shine from the fitting at a 30 degree angle, so that no direct light shines up into the sky or onto neighbours. Apparently a flight over a city like Frankfurt reveals very little light pollution by comparison with South African cities, for example.  These are handy for areas like entrance areas or garages; or storage areas or break rooms at offices. They are also known as "occupancy sensors. They turn on automatically when someone enters a room; and then, after a predetermined amount of time, they turn off automatically. You can vary how long lights stay on after someone leaves, at the time of installation of the sensor.	Consider using passive design. Prefer CFL bulbs. Try halogen or low voltage lighting. Look for the LED (light emitting diode). Seek solar lighting. Look for green light fittings. Switch to a dimmer. Turn it off. Avoid adding to light pollution. Use Motion Detector Light Switches in Selective Areas.
For ancient artifacts, try to piece them together with crazy glue. Stuffed animals can be mounted on wooden poles or in dioramas. Rock specimens can be displayed together or individually. Small fossils such as shells or leaves can be placed in a display case or cabinet, while individual bones of larger animals can be mounted as a skeleton. If bones are missing (they probably will be) you can make plaster copies of other bones or sculpt replicas out of clay.	If you are building a museum, you will of course need a display of objects.
Unfortunately, weeping cherry trees are susceptible to a variety of pest infestations. Aphids, borers, caterpillars and scale insects may attack the tree., Aphids, tiny soft-bodied insects that are usually green or red, can usually be controlled by spraying the tree with a strong spray of water from the garden hose. This crushes them and knocks them to the ground.   Aphids rarely manage to get back on the tree but, if they return, spray them off again. It may need to be done once or twice each week while the aphids are active.  Borers leave holes in the bark on the stems and trunk. Usually the holes are not noticed until the borers have left. The top of the tree may wilt and the leaves may become discolored.There isn’t anything that can be sprayed on the tree to kill them.   However, you can use sharp pruners or loppers to remove the entire branch when borers are detected. Burn or dispose of the branch so that any borers left in the wood will not emerge to attack again. If the borers have weakened the trunk, the entire tree should be removed for safety.  Scale insects are small, flat, immobile insects that are often off-white or brown. Remove severely infested branches with loppers or pruners and put them in the garbage.   Lighter infestations can be controlled with insecticidal soap.Mix 5 tablespoons of insecticidal soap in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Put it into a sprayer and spray the tree until it is dripping, taking care to coat the undersides of the leaves and stems. Wash the soap off after an hour or two as it could damage the leaves if it is left on the tree.  Caterpillars will make nests or tents in the weeping cherry branches and eat the leaves. Remove the nests by hand or with a long stick and put them in the garbage or step on them to kill the caterpillars.  Weeping cherry trees can develop canker, crown rot, root rots, leaf spots, rust and verticillium wilt.  Cankers are bacterial or fungal infections that cause darkened patches of bark that often ooze sap.Remove the entire branch with sharp pruners or loppers when cankers appear. If cankers develop on the trunk, it will be weakened and the tree should be removed for safety.  These rots are caused by a fungal or bacterial infection. These infections take hold when the crown or roots are kept too wet. The most common symptoms of these diseases are wilting and yellow or brown leaves that may drop from the tree.   When weeping cherries contract these disease they often cannot be saved. Try digging the soil away from the crown and top roots carefully and let them dry for a while before watering again.  Rust is a fungal infection that causes orange, powdery-looking areas on the leaves. Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris from around the tree.  Leaf spots are brown or black spots on the leaves which are caused by bacteria or fungi.Remove the infected leaves and clean up debris.   Do not wet the leaves when watering as this is conducive to rust and leaf spot infections.	Recognize different kinds of pests. Spray your tree to fight aphids. Combat borers. Get rid of scale insects. Combat caterpillars. Consider the kinds of disease your tree might be attacked by. Cut away cankers. Combat crown and root rots. Watch out for rust. Look for leaf spots.
Printing things from the Internet and putting them in your carry on isn't that bad an idea. Since you are probably under 13, you sometimes get a little bag filled with goodies like a pack of cards, so that probably would also have little puzzles.; , In your carry on, pack the essentials. iPods, Nintendo DS, a companion (yes, we all have one, whether it's a blanket, Mr. Snuggles or Suzy), wet wipes, a good book, gum, a light jumper, capris and items you printed off the Internet earlier. Put all of it in a small library bag or backpack.  A clean shirt and clean pants will be good enough. Make it loose and long, plane seats rub the skin raw on your legs, and you can change in the bathroom on the plane to your capris if you get too hot.  This is great for last minute snacks at the airport or a mad libs book. ,,	Print. Pack. Dress well. Pack about 15 dollars worth of the other country's currency in your carry on and 15 of yours. Pack some small, cheap toys in your carry on and give them to any whiny toddlers who are annoying you and all other passengers on the plane.  , Try to spend as long as you can only using your imagination as a guide for fun.  , Keep doing this pattern: Puzzles, 1 chapter of book, In flight screen on the back of the seat, Nintendo DS, walk down the aisle.
This machine grinds up stumps and their root systems to a depth of about a foot beneath the ground. Stump grinders can be rented from machine rental houses by the day.If you'd prefer not to operate the machine yourself, you can hire someone to come to your property with a stump grinder and do the job for you.   You should wear gloves, goggles and ear protectors if you plan on operating the machine yourself.  Following the manufacturer's instructions, position the stump grinder and turn it on. It will grind the stump's surface and work its way down into the ground to grind up the roots. You'll need to move the stump grinder around the circumference of the stump in order to take care of the aerial roots as well.  The ground will repair itself more quickly if you remove the ground up wood. Shovel it out and put it in your compost pile or dispose of it in another way.  Replace the grindings with loam or sawdust to fill the hole. Continue adding matter to the area as it depresses over time.	Locate a stump grinder. Position it over the stump and start grinding. Shovel out the grindings. Fill the hole.
This may be a subtle theme or the entire base of your room. Most room decorating articles say this, but it is quite important, otherwise your room will look random and untidy. If your walls are non-paint-able you may wish to add a large, coloured pin-board to your room. If you're lucky, your room came with one of these, but they are relatively easy to make and a savior when it comes to colour themes.; , You really should start over as new as possible. This means deciding what you don't need anymore, and what you can tidy away into your cupboard. Don't go too overboard though. You don't want to throw away things that you may want or need in the future. Create a storage space in your cupboard and hide away the things that don't suite your rooms desired look.  Look over your room: the colour of the walls, ceiling and carpet, the window frames, the colour of the doors... everything matters. Usually most of the above are a white or creamy colour, which can be good or bad (you decide). Also look at the position of the windows in your room, and how much natural light is let in. This overview of your room will give you and idea of what extra furniture or decorations you will need.   If your room is small and doesn't get much light, consider it more of a "night-time room". If your room is airy and gets a lot of sun, it is most probably a "day-time room". Some rooms are lucky enough to be both. Examples of this are rooms with slanting ceilings, skylights, or attic rooms. Although it may seem annoying, these rooms can look wonderful with the right decoration.  Put all the small things in a pile outside your room (books, reading lamps, tissue boxes), leaving the big things (like beds, dressers or bookshelves) in your room. This way you will be able you move your furniture into the position you want it in freely. Once you have done this you will be able to bring in the necessities, like the lamp and the books for the shelf, leaving the decorations till last.  Maybe you decided your room is a night-time room, so you got some fairy-lights. If it is a day-time room, you may have bought a couple of bean bags and made some tissue-paper fairy balls. Whatever it is, leave the decorating till last. If you don't you may later realize that that space is needed for something more important.	Decide on a colour theme. Tidy up!, Go with what you've got. Shuffle your things around. Decorate!
Turbochargers are basically air pumps that are powered by the exhaust gas exiting your engine. The exhaust exiting your engine spins a turbine, which transfers that energy through a driveshaft to a turbine on the other side that sucks in and compresses air into your engine’s intake. In effect, a turbocharger forces more air into the engine than it could possibly take in through normal aspiration. Most turbocharger kits include higher volume fuel pumps, ECU programmers, higher flow fuel pressure regulators and even fuel injectors. Turbocharger kits should be purchased for your specific car unless you are an experienced mechanic.Many turbocharged cars have intercoolers installed between the turbocharger and the car’s intake to cool the air and increase its density. Turbocharging your car requires extensive tuning of the air/fuel ratio that may be best left to professionals.  Centrifugal superchargers and turbochargers work in very similar ways. While a turbocharger is powered by the exhaust leaving the engine, superchargers are belt driven like your car’s power steering pump or air conditioner. Being belt driven means superchargers aren’t as efficient as turbochargers, but they don’t have to wait to be spooled by the exhaust. Because of this distinction, many people prefer superchargers for their more consistent distribution of power. Installing a supercharger kit involves most of the same modifications required for turbochargers in terms of fuel.Roots style superchargers do not mount in the same way but are still belt driven. These superchargers are traditionally found on older model, carbureted engines. On forced induction applications like supercharged cars, you should use a higher octane fuel to increase the stability of the air/fuel mixture in the engine.  Nitrous oxide is a gas that contains more oxygen than the regular air found in the atmosphere. As a result, adding nitrous oxide to the air traveling through your car’s intake serves a similar purpose to forcing more air into it with a turbocharger or supercharger. Instead of forcing more air into the engine mechanically, nitrous oxide introduces more molecules of oxygen into the same amount of space regular air would normally occupy. Nitrous kits that do not mix the nitrous oxide with fuel when injected are referred to as “dry.” These kits are designed to add a smaller amount of power as compared to wet kits, but can be an extremely cost effective method of giving your car a quick horsepower boost.Nitrous oxide kits only affect power output when they are in use, reducing the wear and tear on your engine as compared to consistent power adders like turbochargers and superchargers. After turning on your nitrous kit, you usually control the spray of nitrous with a button or throttle switch that activates when you press the pedal to the floor. Some dry nitrous kits use the fuel pressure regulator to increase fuel pressure going into the engine to compensate for the added oxygen, while some others do not.  Wet nitrous oxide kits serve the same basic function as their dry counterparts, but they mix fuel directly with the nitrous as it is injected into the engine. As a result, wet nitrous kits are often considered to be safer for your engine, as the air/fuel ratio you choose is maintained even with the addition of the nitrous oxide. This stability allows for wet nitrous kits to add even more horsepower than dry kits with relatively low risk of pre-detonation. Like turbochargers and superchargers, properly utilizing nitrous oxide in your car might require custom tuning that may be beyond most hobby mechanics.Wet nitrous oxide kits are usually engaged using buttons just like dry kits. Nitrous oxide is not flammable on its own like movies might have you believe. It must be mixed with a fuel to burn. Nitrous oxide kits can be used in conjunction with a turbocharger or supercharger.	Install a turbocharger kit. Supercharge your car. Add a “dry” nitrous kit to your car. Install a wet nitrous kit in your car.
Before you even think about the first book you want to offer for discussion, take some time to peruse existing online book clubs and check out what kind of software they are using. You don’t have to be a software engineer in order to create a website.; , You might want to use a message board system, an email system or a blog. There are advantages and disadvantage to each option, and your choice should reflect the amount of time you have to devote to interaction. Again, look at a variety of online book club websites and think about which type of discussion forum appeals to you.  Like it or not, first impressions still count. People see the graphics before they start to read the content. Experiment with colors and different fonts. Ask your family and close friends to look at your website, and ask them to navigate through it before it goes live. Listen to the feedback and work on making your online book group site an enticing stop for book lovers.  Make your first book choice one that you are passionate about. Be prepared to keep the discussion going. If you can’t think of a list of questions, check out some reading group guides on the Internet. Here are some standard discussion questions you might want to use:   What do you think of the book’s title? How deep into the book did you get before you understood the relevance of the title? Did the title reflect the main themes of the book? What are the key characteristics of the protagonist? How did the personality and life experience of the protagonist shape the direction of the novel? Did the action in the novel parallel important events in history? Did reading the book evoke any strong emotion in you? Did you cry? Did you laugh? Why? Was there one event in the novel that resonated with you deeply?  , Do some research on the author or the setting in the book. Add links to book reviews, positive and negative, and ask your members to comment on those reviews.  It takes time to build up a membership, and your members will grow if you keep the content fresh and interesting. Keep all discussions active. Ideally, you will want to check in with your website multiple times during each day. Always provide new information so that your site doesn’t appear to be stagnant.  Ask your family and friends to drop in and join in the discussion. Invite all your Facebook friends and all of your email contacts. Print your own business cards with the name of your website; ask the local book stores, coffee shops and libraries if you may leave your cards there.  You can do this by following up on every comment so that your visitors don’t feel like they are being ignored. It’s up to you to keep the conversation flowing.	Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. Think about how you would like the discussions to flow. Make your website inviting. Start with what you know. Offer more to your readers than a book discussion. Keep it fresh. Market your new online group. Make people feel welcome.
Travel websites like Expedia, Hotwire, Travelocity, etc., offer a ‘one stop shop’ for items like hotels and car rentals. These websites allow you to search for car rentals in specific locations and for a specific time frame, but unlike a car rental agency's website, you can compare the prices between multiple companies.Travel websites usually have consistent cancellation polices between rental companies, so you don’t need to look up separate policies for each company.Some travel websites also have their own reward points which can be earned on anything booked via the website, regardless of the company you book with. You can then apply these reward points to future bookings made on the same site. Travel websites may also display comments on whether a particular listing is considered a good deal or not. This can help direct you towards listings that are displaying discounts and price reductions. Some travel websites provide you with the option to compare prices between multiple travel websites to ensure you really are getting the best deal possible.Some travel websites may also provide a price guarantee, so if you book a car rental and find a cheaper deal within a certain period of time, the website will honour the lower price (and sometimes give you something extra). Keep in mind, however, that you have to be the one who finds this alternate deal. If you stop searching for a car rental after you’ve booked one, you’ll never be able to take advantage of this guarantee.; , In addition to travel websites that offer deals on multiple types of travel items (e.g. hotels, flights, etc.), there are also websites that specialize in car rental deals. Two well known sites are CarRentals.com and AutoRentals.com.   Similar to a travel website, simply enter the location where you want to pick-up the car, and the dates you need the car, and the website will search all possible options. Once the website has finished searching, it will display a list of prices for the location and dates you’ve specified, from multiple car rental agencies. This method allows you to compare deals all on one page.Note that many of these car rental websites are owned and operated by the same companies that operate the travel websites, therefore the deals may not be any different. For example, CarRentals.com is owned by Expedia.  Many major hotel chains and airlines partner with car rental agencies in order to offer their customers special discounts. For airlines, you can often find information pertaining to car rental discounts right on their website.For hotels, you can speak to someone at the concierge desk, or visit the car rental agency right inside the hotel.Many car rental agencies have offices right inside hotels. While this may be super convenient, it may not always be the least expensive option available.  Groupon has a Car Rental Centre under their Getaways link that shows all available discounts and deals for car rental agencies.Unlike other Groupon deals where you have to purchase an actual Groupon coupon via the website and then use it at the store, most car rental discounts will simply link you directly to the car rental agency's website with a specific coupon code. You can then select your location and dates, and the coupon code is already included when you checkout.	Use travel websites. Search for deals on consolidated car rental websites. Look for deals on airline or hotel websites. Get deals through Groupon.
You don't have to dance right in front of the guy the whole time -- that can get boring, and you may actually want to see your dance partner once in a while. So, you can move over to the left, continuing your circular motion and bent knees motion, while the guy moves to the right, so you can look up and see him. You can switch places and move to the right while he moves to the left, and keep moving back and forth.  Turn around to face the guy instead of turning your back to him, and place your arms around his neck. This is called front grinding -- it's more risky and more sexy. Let him put his hands on your hips as you continue to move your waist in a circular motion. Move your hands away from his neck, and up and down his chest. Then, turn back around again.   You can even place your fingers in the guy's belt loops for a few seconds.  When your back is to the guy, you can move your hands all the way down to the floor or near it, as you raise your butt more and more in the air. This is a more intimate move that is sure to make the guy go crazy -- as long as you have the confidence to pull it off.  Don't be intimidated if a slower song comes on at the club. You can still grind more slowly to the music, using the same moves you used to grind to fast-paced music, just at a lower speed. The slow grind is even sexier if you can pull it off. Don't let the guy see that you've been thrown off -- just continue to move to the music without skipping a beat.	Move from side to side. Turn it around. Touch the floor. Do the slow grind.
You will need to find where the rattling pipes are and you need to be able to access them for this solution. If this is not possible, you may need to call in professional assistance.; , This is the solution. You can use a number of items to wrap the pipes, including old inner tubes, rubber blanketing material, garden hoses etc. If there are any issues concerning fire-proofing, ask for assistance from your hardware store.  Cut the material that you are using to wrap the pipes to the required length. Wrap it around the relevant pipes and make sure that the pipes are completely covered. Tie on if necessary. , Usually the pipes affected will be over quite an area. You may not need to wrap every part of the pipe structure; sometimes it is sufficient to wrap every few feet or metres to silence the pipes effectively.	Locate the troublesome pipes. Select appropriate pipe wrapping. Wrap the pipes. Attach the wrapping material to the floor joists or similar solid object using nail-on metal pipe strapping.  , Continue covering the area affected.
(Root, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.) For purposes of this example, let's use the “C” scale, which is: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.; , So the notes in a C diminished chord are: C, Eb, & Gb. (It is like a C minor, {C, Eb, & G} with the fifth, G, also flatted.) A C diminished chord would typically be denoted either: C dim, C Dim and occasionally as C-.  (C dim = C, Eb, Gb) Then the doubly flatted seventh is added; Bbb. Yes a double flatted seventh is the same note as the sixth, so a Bbb is also an A. —However, since the chord is called a diminished seventh, the seventh tone of the scale must be present and “A” is the sixth tone of the “C” scale, not the seventh. To be any type of seventh chord, the seventh tone of the scale must be present in some form. Therefore, to be theoretically correct, the note must be called a “B” double flat, —not an “A”. So, the notes in a C dim7 chord are: C, Eb, Gb, & Bbb.  (Up a minor third from C is Eb, up another minor third is Gb and up another minor third is Bbb (which is also A) So, C dim7 is one chord, C# dim7 or Db dim 7 is the second chord, and D dim7 is the third chord, - - - and when you reach Eb dim7 / D# dim7, you will be playing the same note that are in a C dim7. (Eb, Gb, Bbb {also known as A} and Dbb {also known as C})  , Since only twelve notes and their octaves exist and since 12 ÷ 4 = 3, there are only three diminished chords possible before you are playing a different inversion of the same chord again. , And  ,	Diminished Chords: Like all chords, diminished chords and diminished 7th chords are formed from the intervals of the major scale, which is. A diminished chord is the root, the flatted third, and the flatted fifth. Diminished 7th Chords: The notes in a diminished 7th chord are the same as those in a diminished chord, the root, flatted third and flatted fifth. There are only three Diminished 7th chords: Each ascending note in a diminished seventh chord is the minor third (a whole step followed by a half step) of the one preceding it. Every diminished seventh chord is really four chords, containing four evenly spaced notes each. The C, Eb/D#, Gb/F# & A (Bbb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes.  , The C#/Db, E, G, & Bb (Cbb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes. The D, F, Ab/G# & B (Cb) diminished seventh chords all contain exactly the same notes.
You can use old, scratched up DVDs that no longer, or you can use blank DVDs instead. You can also use CDs instead, but DVDs seem to be more colorful and holographic., Set the DVD down onto a heat-safe surface, or hold it by the edges. Blow dry the DVD using the hottest setting on you hairdryer for a few minutes., A DVD is composed of two layers with a thin, holographic film in the middle. You want the holographic film to stick to the back/clear layer of the DVD, not the front/decorated part. Work slowly and carefully.The DVD will be hot, so be careful. Discard the top, colored part of the DVD. Save the bottom part with the holographic film.  You can cut it into squares, rectangles, triangles, or random pieces. It would be a good idea to have a variety of shapes and sizes, especially if your vase is round., Wash the vase using soap and water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. Wipe down the vase one last time using rubbing alcohol. This will remove any oils that might prevent the glue from sticking.   From now on, try to handle the vase only from the inside. Square or rectangular vases will be easier to work with than round vases. The shape is entirely up to you, however.  Your DVD tiles will be a little translucent, so this will help the colors show up better. Apply 2 to 3, thin coats of flat, white spray paint to you vase. Let each layer dry before applying the next. Allow the vase to dry completely before moving on.   For a neater finish, line the rim of your vase with painter's tape, then stuff it with newspaper. Remove both once the vase dries.  You can use hot glue, but it would be better if you used a glue meant specifically for glass. Start at one end of the vase, and work your way to the other. You can leave small gaps between the tiles, or make them flush against one another.  How long this takes depends on what type of glue you used. Hot glue sets up very quickly, but many glass glues take much longer.  This is not necessary, but it will help hide any glue and give you a more mosaic effect. You can fill the gaps in using black or white puff paint/dimensional fabric paint.You can also use grout instead.For a more interesting effect, try silver puff paint/dimensional fabric paint instead. If you are using grout, be sure to mix it according to the instructions on the package. Apply the grout to the vase, then wipe it off with a damp cloth., Again, how long this takes depends on what you used. Both can take several hours to dry, but some types of grout can take several weeks. Once everything is dry, your holographic vase is ready to use! Fill it with water, then add some freshly-cut flowers into it.	Get some DVDs. Heat the DVD up using a hairdryer. Use a butter knife to pry apart the DVD. Cut up the DVD into small pieces. Clean your desired vase. Paint your vase with flat, white spray paint. Start gluing the tiles to the vase. Let the glue dry. Fill the gaps in, if desired. Let the puff paint or grout dry before using the vase.
The Symmetry series is one of Otterbox's simplest cases: a flexible silicone enclosure for your phone. The seal is tight, so you'll have the best luck starting from a corner and pushing the case off the edge. Otterbox recommends starting at the top edge., Wedge the card under an edge of the flexible case. Lever it back and forth to pry the case away from the device enough to grasp it with your finger.  Once you have a corner off, you can work your way around the edge of the case to remove it. Be careful with the port covers so that they don't get torn.	Push the case off one of the corners with your thumb. Use a hard plastic card if necessary. Work your way around the case.
There are many brands of engine degreaser you can choose from, but most of them tend to work in the same way. Spray the degreaser on the engine from the bottom up, as this will ensure total coverage.Most degreasers come in a spray bottle to make spraying it on the engine easy and simple. Read the instructions on the degreaser you purchase to ensure you use the best method for the specific cleaner.  Engine degreaser can remove clear coat from paint, so be careful not to overspray while covering the engine. If you do get any degreaser on the fenders or other painted areas, rinse it off quickly to avoid damaging the paint.Degreaser can remove the shine from automotive paint. Rinse degreaser off painted surfaces as quickly as possible.  Engine degreaser works by eating away at the stuck on grime on the engine. For fairly dirty engines, three minutes is sufficient to loosen up stuck on grease and oil. For especially dirty engines, allow the degreaser to soak for five full minutes before rinsing.If the instructions on the degreaser you chose states a different amount of time, follow the instructions on your bottle. The longer the degreaser sits, the better job it will do. After five minutes or so the degreaser will begin to drip off of the engine.  With the degreaser still soaking on the engine, use a stiff bristled or steel toothed brush to scrub away at any large deposits of grease, burned oil or grime. It should break loose fairly easily with the degreaser already applied.Wear eye protection while scrubbing the engine to avoid getting degreaser in your eyes. Wear gloves to prevent prolonged contact with the degreaser on your skin. You only need to scrub the engine if it has unusually large deposits of stuck on grime.  Do not use a high pressure hose to rinse the engine, as it may disconnect wires or penetrate the plastic you used to cover electronics. A regular garden hose with the nozzle set to stream will rinse the engine effectively and remove most of the grime.If you rinse the engine completely and it still looks dirty, reapply the degreaser and allow it to sit for another few minutes.  Once you have rinsed the engine off, you should begin washing your car immediately. This will ensure you clean any engine degreaser off of painted components before it has the chance to do any significant damage.Be sure to use a different bucket, sponges, rags and towels on the body of the car. Wax any areas of the car that may have come into contact with degreaser.	Apply engine degreaser. Avoid getting any degreaser on painted components. Allow the degreaser to soak in for three to five minutes. Use a stiff bristled brush to scrub stuck on grime. Rinse the engine with a regular hose. Wash the car.
Depending on where you're submitting, you will need to be able to send in your music on a physical CD or electronically through a digital format such as MP3.   For CD distribution, you usually don't need fancy packaging or elaborate press kits. In fact, many radio stations will request that you not send in materials like this. Some musicians insist that a plain silver CD-R with your name and the song title, accompanied by a track listing in a clear plastic case, is all you need. Whatever packaging you choose, make sure all your information is clear, complete, concise, and correct. You don't want a music director to fall in love with your song only to be unable to figure out who it belongs to!; , Some radio stations may accept email attachments, but more often if they accept electronic submissions they will want a link to an online source for your music. You have many options for digital distribution.   If you want your music more publicly available, you can use services such as iTunes, Amazon Music, or Bandcamp. iTunes allows you to sign up to sell your music for free;Amazon Music requires you to use a distributor to sell your music through their Digital Music store.Bandcamp is also free to sign up and is becoming increasingly popular with artists.Examine several options and choose the best for your situation. You can also get your music online by using websites such as YouTube or Vimeo. Read the Terms and Conditions for any website carefully; you want to make sure you keep your copyright and permission to sell your music! Sites such as Soundcloud, Mediafire, and Sendspace operate legal file sharing services that allow music directors to download your music without having to worry about viruses and other safety issues., You may or may not be requested to submit a press kit with your music. However, it doesn't hurt to have one ready to go. Most press kits include several basic elements that will help people get to know you quickly.   Write a cover letter. This should be addressed to the person to whom you're submitting your music. Include your contact information, any webpages (YouTube, Facebook, website, etc.) that you have, and basic information about your music (genre, themes, etc.). Write a short biography. This should be a short description of you (or your band, if you have one) and your accomplishments so far. You can talk about your influences and interests here, but keep this part story-oriented. Consider it like your introduction to a new friend.Create a "fact sheet." This should include the essential information about you: name, style of music, other artists/bands you are similar to, instrumentation, etc.  The genre of music you play will help to determine the radio stations that are likely to play your song. For example, public radio stations (such as local National Public Radio affiliates) tend to focus on indie, jazz, and singer-songwriter types.Your local college radio station may be a good choice for music that draws a younger audience, such as rap, hip-hop, and rock.Make sure you send your song to a station that's shown they play that type of music.  You're probably going to need to start small, especially if you haven't signed with a record label yet. College radio stations are excellent places to get your start, because they tend to be open to playing new and less mainstream music. They also tend to be less driven by advertising and business concerns than commercial radio, so they might be more willing to take a chance on your song.However, commercial radio stations may also be interested in your music, especially if you're a local act, so check out the websites for the stations in your area.   You can find radio station locators on the internet. These will allow you to search by state, city, or country.Look for titles like "music director," "station manager," "production manager," or "DJ." These are usually the people in charge of receiving, selecting, and playing new music. If you're not sure whom to contact, try calling the station's general information line and asking to be connected to the person in charge of music programming. You can also call in to the station during a specific program: often, DJs answer the phone during their programs and you can ask them about getting your song on air. This works particularly well if you call a show focusing on the genre of music you make., Internet radio is still broadcast radio's younger cousin, but it's another venue for emerging artists. Many internet radio stations allow -- even welcome! -- submissions from musicians who are new on the scene.   Pandora allows direct submissions.AmazingRadio.com is another online station that accepts independent and emerging artists.Live365.com will host your music in their Music Library, which will allow their online stations access to it.  Many DJs and radio stations have social media accounts now. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook and check out their blogs and playlists. You'll have a better chance of personalizing your submission if you know who you're sending your song to.   You can also reach out to radio stations and DJs through social media. A tweet to them about your music will get your name out there without seeming overly aggressive.  Submission guidelines vary widely, depending on where you're submitting your music. In general, though, music on CD seems to be the preferred submission method. Few places will accept a digital file sent as an email attachment.   If the radio station's website provides specific guidelines, follow them! Nothing will turn off staff faster than you not following their directions. Many stations will discard music without listening to it if it isn't submitted properly. If you can't find information about submitting your music online, contact the station with your inquiry directly. Send a short, friendly email explaining who you are, your musical experiences, and what your song is about. If you have a YouTube, Facebook, or other media page, include a link. Don't send any attachments; many places won't open email attachments because of security and virus concerns.  A personalized submission is far more likely to catch a music director or DJ's eye than a form email that's clearly been sent to 500 other stations.   This also goes for physical CD submissions. Whenever possible, customize your submission using people's names (if you can find them) and a brief statement of why you fit in with their station's "feel."  , Once you've established the guidelines for submitting your music, send it in! Give complete information -- your contact info and the CD's track listing are essential -- but don't send anything that isn't asked for.  It can take days, weeks, or even months for your song to make it into the hands of a music director, especially if you've sent it to a larger station. Don't harass people with calls or emails. Remember, they get many submissions from hopeful artists just like you, and it takes awhile to listen to everything.   The radio station may give a time-frame for responding to you. If it's past that time-frame, a friendly email inquiry is appropriate, but try not to sound accusative or angry. A simple email asking if the music director has had time to listen to your submission yet will suffice.  It's always awesome when an artist gets a big break, but there are many artists and bands out there and only so much radio space. You may be rejected from the first several stations you contact, and that's okay. Be persistent and patient. Being rejected doesn't mean your music is bad!	Prepare your music for distribution. Make your music easily shareable online. Compose a press kit. Determine your radio options. Research your local stations. Consider alternative radio. Make connections. Read guidelines carefully. Customize your submissions. Send in your music. Wait. Prepare for rejection.
You’ll need something that can cut through small leaf stems and roots, such as a knife from your kitchen. Scissors can also be used, and if you’ve let a big plant go for a while, you many need shears to tame it.   Sterilize kitchen knives before using them on your plant. You can do this by rubbing alcohol on the blade, and letting it dry.; , Tackle the bad leaves first. Carefully move the branches and leaves if you have to in order to find any leaves that are dried, brown, or dead. Unhealthy leaves that are highly discolored can also be removed. Use your knife or scissors to cut them at the stem./images/thumb/7/76/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/7/76/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-2-Version-4.jpg          Be gentle as you do this so that you do not accidentally break healthy leaves. Pests or disease on these leaves can infect the plant, so these leaves must be removed. Poor lighting, too little water, or too much water are causes for dying leaves.  Use your knife or shears to remove enough healthy leaves to make the plant fit in the pot. Bring the cutting tool to the base of the stem and slice through cleanly. These leaves are the oldest and contain the most aloe vera gel./images/thumb/2/21/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/2/21/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-3-Version-4.jpg          The gel has many medicinal purposes. If you want to use these leaves, cut the thorny edges on the leaves and store the leaves in the refrigerator until you want to extract the gel. Avoid cutting leaves closest to the plant's main stem. These leaves are young and are needed to replace the old leaves.  Cut these at the stem the same way you cut leaves. Once the flowers on the plant blossom, they soon drop seeds. While they die, they use nutrients that the plant could be putting towards new, healthy leaves. Since flowers rarely occur on aloe grown as a houseplant, if you grow your aloe vera indoors, you will likely not have to deal with blossoms./images/thumb/1/1d/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/1/1d/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-4-Version-4.jpg          Dead flowers attract bugs and can drop into the plant’s pot, absorbing water and creating a mess.  Also called pups, suckers are offshoot plants. These new growths take energy away from your plant and crowd the pot. Most of the time, you can pull the shoots up out of the dirt with no harm to the plants. Use your cutting tool to cut the shoot off of your plant./images/thumb/5/5f/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg /images/thumb/5/5f/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-5-Version-4.jpg          Some suckers may get buried and tangled under the soil, so you’ll have to take the plant out of the pot, carefully remove the dirt from the root ball, and untangle the roots. Suckers are new aloe vera plants, so you can plant each one in fresh soil in a separate pot to grow another plant. Let them dry out for a few days before replanting them, and make sure to use a special potting mix designed for cacti and succulents.  Make sure the soil is slightly damp before you remove the plant; this will help prevent damage to the roots. Gently hold the stem of the plant as you tilt the pot to the side. The plant should come out if you pull on it. If it doesn’t, try squeezing the pot or tapping it against a solid surface. Deal with any suckers you couldn’t get before./images/thumb/2/26/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/2/26/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-6-Version-3.jpg         , If you need to repot the plant, you may need to do this. First, shake the dirt off the plant. Trim the long root and remove some side roots. The amount that you leave should be enough to take up about 2/3 of its new pot. This makes the aloe vera easier to transport but also allows it to regrow a stronger root system in new soil. Water lightly until the plant has adjusted./images/thumb/d/de/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/d/de/Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Trim-an-Aloe-Vera-Plant-Step-7-Version-3.jpg          Let the plant air out for a day after pruning the roots. This will let any cuts on the roots heal into callouses and prevent long-term damage to the plant. Look out for root rot. Find any damaged areas and slice them off, being careful not to damage the healthy root. Sprinkle powdered sulfur or charcoal on the pruned areas if you can.	Get a cutting utensil. Trim damaged leaves. Cut excess outer leaves. Remove old stems and blossoms. Remove suckers. Remove the plant from its pot. Prune the roots.
If you are going to be rhyming words, it is important that you have a few to pick from. Read books and news articles that contain polished, refined writing. If you come across a word you don't know, look it up.  As you add to your vocabulary, try reading certain passages out loud and noticing where you naturally tend to add emphasis. In English, for example, a lot of poetry and song lyrics are written in iambic pentameter, in which the first syllable is unstressed, the second is stressed, the third is unstressed, and so on for a total of five stressed syllables and five unstressed syllables. Developing your sense of meter will ultimately help you form a beat to your lyrics, or the lyrics to your beat, in a way that sounds reflexive and easy.   Try saying "rapper" both ways, with the first syllable stressed and the second unstressed, then vice versa. Notice the difference? It might sound dorky, but a good way to introduce yourself to iambic pentameter is to read Shakespeare aloud. (Search for his plays online.) You'll begin to notice the alternating stressed syllables and how naturally they flow.  Your lyrics should have an objective other than making words rhyme. The rhyme is the glue for your lyrics, but the substance is in your message. What do you want to say? When you're talking to other people, which topics really get you fired up?   Whatever you choose, be real - rapping about your own life gives the song credibility.  Rap lyrics can happen anywhere - at home, at work, at school, on the toilet, and in your sleep. Write down what comes to you without censoring yourself or editing. When you're struggling with writer's block later, refer back to your ideas.  A hook is the part of a song that gets stuck in your head and makes you want to listen to it again. For most raps, this makes up the chorus. It doesn't have to be long, but it should have a catchy rhythm and be fun to hum.   For a lot of songwriters, the hook is the most difficult part to create. Don't feel discouraged if it takes you awhile to come up with one - it's better to wait for a good hook than to wrap up your song with a bad one.  After you have worked out a final draft of your rap lyrics, memorize every word. When you go to perform your rap song in the studio you don't want to be reading from your notebook.  It is a freeware that is user-friendly and works quite well. If you own a Mac, you can record using Garage Band, which is already installed. After you gain more experience, it is recommended that you move onto other software such as Audio Audition. They are not free, but they are better than the free ones.  Pick a beat that you want to use to rap on. You can search for rap beats on youtube, or download rap beats from a beat distributor. A good strategy here is to already have the core of your rhymes written, and just work on adapting them to fit your beat. A common pitfall is if you try to write the core of your lyrics to a beat, you can likely suffer from "writers block" because you are trying to be creative and do revisions at the same time.  Using your mic and your audio editing software, you can now begin recording. Load your downloaded beat to the software and record over it. Remember to add emotion or you will sound like a robot metaphorically speaking!  , While this is time-consuming, it gives you a wider variety of takes to choose from. Record at least 1 to 3 more times. This is because your first time might not be perfect.  Now that you've done several takes, choose the one you feel like is best and delete the rest.	Build your vocabulary. Develop an ear for rhythm. Get focused. Write it down. Come up with a good hook. Memorize your lyrics. Download an audio editing software: If you are a new rapper, it is recommended that you get Audacity. Revise to a beat. Record your rap. Record your rap again. Select the best track.
If you want to create any TV series, you need an idea. Something that you can base your show around. Casualty is based around an ED department and Eastenders is based around the inhabitants of a square.; , The script is what your actors and crew will follow to know what they say/do and what the episode is all about. Before writing your script you should create notes about characters, storylines and ideas - this should be the bible to follow when writing. You cannot have a show without a script - or series bible.  If you want to produce it yourself, then you will need actors, film, sound and directors. If you want a company to produce it for you then send the script into them, along with a short pitch (a page or so on what the show is about). You have more chance if you send the script into a company that produces similar shows. Or you can just send the script to everyone.  They will guide you on the amount of money to sell your idea for and will make sure the company is treating you fairly.  The pilot episode is the first episode in your series. The events that happen in the pilot are what the show should be based around. Normally, after the pilot, the audience is asked what they think about it. If they like it, more episodes will be commissioned - if not, then the end is near.  Once you have everything you need, and the audience approves, you can start filming your show. You can film in a closed studio or get the audience in to watch (this normally happens with sitcom).  No body will watch the show if they don't know about it.	Create an Idea. Create a script. Start thinking about production. If accepted, the company usually offers money, ask for a writing agent fist. Create a Pilot. FILM!. Advertise!
You want to use paper that’s as thin as possible, so tobacco rolling paper works well. When you’re cutting the paper, the strip should be very narrow, approximately ¼-inch wide. It’s a good idea to taper the strip, though, so you’ll have a thicker portion that’s easier to grip with your fingers. You don’t need to make it too long -- 3 to 4 inches is sufficient.If you don’t have tobacco paper on hand, tissue paper, cellophane wrappers from food or other products, or store receipts are effective alternatives. If you want to make it even easier to grab the paper, attach a thin stick, such as a chopstick, to the end of the paper to create a handle., Make sure that you set the thinner end of the strip over the tone hole, and gently close the pad over it. The paper should be sandwiched between the pad and tone hole, but the wide edge should hang over the edge so you can grip it with your fingers., Grasp the wide end of the strip, and carefully tug on it. As you pull, pay attention to the amount of drag or resistance that you feel. If you can pull the paper out easily, you’ve identified the leak.You should repeat this process at four different spots around the pad to check for a leak all the way around.	Cut a strip of thin paper. Place the paper under the pad. Pull on the paper.
During a tsunami, low-lying areas near the ocean are extremely vulnerable to the waves. You should know how at risk your family is before a disaster occurs, so you know how to prepare. Your parents will probably know if your home is a tsunami hazard area, but you should also know how high your street is above sea level and how far your neighborhood is from the coast and other areas where waves may occur. Those numbers usually help officials decide if you need to evacuate during a tsunami.If you're not sure whether you live in an area that is at risk for a tsunami, visit your local emergency management department's website. There is usually a map or search engine that allows you to put in your address to determine if you're in a tsunami evacuation zone. Even if your home is safe, other areas that you visit regularly may be in danger during a tsunami. Find out how far above sea level and how far from the coast your school is. Your parents should know that information about the places they work too. While any area near an ocean coast can experience a tsunami, they usually occur most often in the Pacific Ocean because of the fault lines beneath the ocean there.On average, only two tsunamis occur each year, and they only affect the area around the source. Large tsunamis that cause ocean-wide destruction occur much less frequently.; , Hopefully, you’ll never have to worry about a tsunami or other natural disasters, but being prepared is the best way to keep yourself safe. Talk to your family about creating an emergency kit, so if you are trapped during a tsunami, you have everything you need, such as food, water, and medical supplies, to survive for several days. Place the items in an easy to carry container -- a duffle bag, camping backpack, or unused trash can work well.Your kit should have 3-gallons of water per person, per day. For evacuating, it should be 3 days worth. In case you’re trapped in your home, it should be 2 weeks worth.Pack the kit with non-perishable food that’s easy to prepare, such as canned beans. Have a 3 day supply for evacuation and 2 weeks’ worth for your home. Make sure your kit has at least one flashlight and a battery-operated radio to keep up with news reports. Add fresh batteries to the kit as well. In case of injuries, it’s important to have a first aid kit in your emergency supplies for minor injuries. However, if anyone in your family has special medical needs, such as medications, eye glasses, or syringes, there should be a supply of those as well. Make sure there are enough to get through at least a week. If you have a baby sibling, check that the kit includes diapers, baby, food, and formula. If you have a pet in your family, you’ll need items such as a collar, leash, pet food, and bowls. Your kit should have a multipurpose tool with features such as a can opener. Communication devices come in handy in an emergency kit. Add a cell phone with charger and/or two-way radios. You may not have access to clean, running water during and after a tsunami, but include personal hygiene products, such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and deodorant. Make sure to add several rolls of toilet paper as well. Emergency blankets, sleeping bags, rain gear, and changes of clothing for everyone in the family are also important. Include maps of your area in the kit, so if you get confused about where your family should evacuate to, you have a guide. You may be stuck in your home, at a shelter, or some other evacuation location for a while during a tsunami. Pack some games, books, and other activities for you and your siblings in the kit to help keep you busy during the disaster.  If you live in a low-lying area, you likely can’t stay at your home when a tsunami hits. That’s why your family must plan an evacuation route, so you know how to leave your home safely and reach higher ground. Your family should choose a destination that’s 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level and approximately 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland. Make sure that everyone in the family knows how to get there, including the specific route to take.To be sure that everyone is ready, practice the evacuation route several times a year. Practicing means you won’t have to think as much during an actual tsunami because you’ll know exactly what to do. If your family is taking a trip to a location that is prone to tsunamis, have your parents check with the hotel or resort to determine what the evacuation policy is for guests during a disaster.  It’s possible that you may be at school when a tsunami hits, so you should pay careful attention when teachers and other school official go over the evacuation policy. That way, you’ll know where to go and how to leave the school safely.During a tsunami, evacuation roads are going to be crowded and it may be difficult to get in touch with your parents. Make sure they know whether they should pick you up at your school, at an emergency shelter, or another location.  During a tsunami, phone lines may be down or overloaded, so it’s important for your family to develop a way to get in touch with one another in case you’re separated. Everyone in your family should know how to text because that may be the only way to contact one another. It’s also a good idea to have an emergency contact for the family. That should be someone who lives out of town -- it may be easier to get through to someone who isn’t in the immediate area during a disaster. Memorize the number or have it stored in your phone. Take the time to make contact cards for everyone in the family that includes your emergency contact’s information and any other phone numbers that might be important during a tsunami. You and your family members should carry the cards with them at all times. Don’t forget to include the numbers for the police, fire department, hospitals, and other emergency services on your contact card.  While you’ll probably notified of a possible tsunami on the TV, radio, or internet, it still helps to know the signs yourself. When a tsunami occurs, you’ll notice severe ground shaking due to the underwater earthquakes that cause the waves. Ocean water may move away from the coast, so shells, sand, and sea life are suddenly exposed. You may also hear a loud roaring sound that’s similar to a plane engine as a tsunami approaches.If you observe any of these signs, you should evacuate as soon as possible even if no official orders have been given. Your area may also have a siren or other type of audible warning that occurs when a tsunami warning is issued. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the warnings, so you know if there’s danger.  When there is a good chance that your area will be affected by a tsunami, your local authorities will likely issue a warning to alert residents. They’ll also tell you if you have to evacuate based on where your home or school is located. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully and as quickly as possible. Because you’ve practiced your evacuation route with your family, you should know exactly where to go and how to get there.Official tsunami warnings and evacuation orders are usually shared via TV or radio news. You can also find information on the internet. If you’re away from home at the beach or other low-lying areas when a tsunami warning is issued, move inland immediately. If possible, run uphill so you reach higher ground where the waves can’t reach you. Don’t ever stay to watch a tsunami. If you’re close enough to see a wave, you’re probably close to run away from it. If you can’t escape to higher ground quickly enough, the best option is to climb to the roof of a tall, sturdy building or a tree. Trees can be uprooted during a tsunami, though, so be sure to choose one that is large and strong., When you’re evacuating, you must make sure that you’ve accounted for all of the family members who live with you, including your parents, siblings, and grandparents. However, make sure that you find all of your pets as well. If a situation is dangerous for you, it’s dangerous for your animals -- and they usually don’t have the means to protect themselves.To avoid losing your pets during an evacuation or tsunami situation, keep animals on leashes or in carriers. Even if your home is in an area that’s not vulnerable to the tsunami, make sure to watch them so they don’t wander off.  If you live in a coastal area, you may actually feel the earthquakes that cause the waves. It’s extremely easy to get injured in an earthquake, so if you feel the ground shaking for more than 20 seconds, drop to the ground and take cover under a desk or table, making sure to hold on tightly.As soon as the shaking stops, round up your family and evacuate as quickly as possible. The earthquake is usually a sign that a tsunami is only a few minutes away.  A tsunami can cause destruction to buildings, power lines, and other items. Make sure to avoid buildings from which heavy objects might fall or large trees that may be uprooted or lose branches. Don’t go near downed power lines either because they may be live and you could electrocute yourself.Bridges can become unstable during the earthquakes that accompany tsunamis, so take care if you need to cross any when you’re evacuating., Before you can help anyone else after a tsunami, it’s important to check that you’re not hurt. Examine yourself to see if you have any injuries that require first aid. If it’s a minor injury, such as a small cut or scrape, you can probably handle it yourself. However, if you have a more serious injury, such as a broken bone, talk to your parents so you can get medical assistance as soon as possible.If you have an injury that is extremely painful, avoid moving around too much. You may wind up making it worse.  If you have younger brothers and sisters, make sure that they are safe and uninjured after the tsunami. Older relatives, such as grandparents, may also need assistance because they may not be able to move around too well on their own. If anyone needs serious medical attention, bring it to your parents’ attention.Make sure that you know where the first aid kit is in your emergency kit, so you can help with minor injuries, such as putting antibacterial ointment and a bandage on a cut.  It’s common for people to become trapped after tsunami because the earthquake and strong waves can cause items to fall and block people in. If someone in your family or a neighbor is trapped, don’t try to rescue them on your own. Instead, call emergency professionals who have the right equipment to safely extract people.People have been known to get injured or killed when they try to rescue someone on their own. While you have may the best intentions in mind, you may wind up putting yourself in serious danger if you try to help a friend or family member.  In the days following a tsunami, phone lines are probably going to be jammed with emergency workers trying to communicate with needed resources. To keep the lines open for them, avoid making calls unless there is an emergency, such as someone needing to be rescued or to receive medical assistance.If you want to get in touch with family members or friends to make sure that they’re safe after a tsunami, text instead of calling. The added benefit to texting is that it will often work even when cell phone service is out.  If you had to evacuate during a tsunami, you’ll probably want to return home as soon as it’s over. However, you and your family should only go home if local authorities have announced that it is safe to do so. Tsunamis often involve a series of waves that can take place over hours, so even if one passes, there may be another one on the way.In some cases, the subsequent waves may be larger and more dangerous than the first, so it’s important to ensure that tsunami is over before you head home.  Even if the tsunami has passed and officials have decided that you can return home, you should be careful when you go back. Stay out of your home or any building that still has water in it. The water may cause floors to split and walls to collapse, so the building may be a danger for you and your family.If you’re not sure whether a building still has water in it or not, try to look through a window to see. Avoid going inside if you’re not sure.  You may assume that your home is safe if there is no water inside, but there are other dangerous problems that may occur after a tsunami. Even if the water has receded, the floors may be damaged, so be careful where you step. Your parents also should check the house for gas leaks, as well as other fire hazards, such as frayed wires, a submerged fuse box or circuit breaker, and wet electrical appliances.It’s best to let your parents inspect your home before you go inside. They’ll be able to tell if everything is safe, so you and your siblings don’t injure yourselves. You can usually tell if there’s a gas leak if you smell gas in your home or you hear a hissing or blowing sound. If you suspect there’s a leak, tell your parents and immediately leave the house.	Determine how at risk your home is. Build an emergency kit. Plan an evacuation route. Know your school’s evacuation plan. Create a family communications plan. Know the signs. Pay attention to official evacuation orders. Remember your pets. Protect yourself from an earthquake. Avoid hazards as you evacuate. Check yourself for injuries. Help your younger siblings and grandparents. Call for help if someone needs to be rescued. Don’t use the phone unless it’s an emergency. Return home only when it is safe. Stay out of buildings with water. Check your home for dangers.
Beatbox patterns typically incorporate three types of sounds: snares, hi-hats, and basslines. Create and label a line in your drum tab for each type of sound to map out your pattern. Separate beats with a single vertical line, and bars with double vertical lines, like so:   S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|; , For example, if you wish to use a vocalization in place of a traditional sound, create a fourth line in your drum tab and label it “V:”   S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  V |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  , Whenever you use an additional sound that’s unique to your pattern, create a symbol to denote that sound within the drum tab. Then define that symbol below the drum tab for others’ reference as well as your own. For example, if you’re going to vocalize the word “What?” in place of a traditional sound, use “W” as a symbol within the drum tab, and define “W” below the bar tab as “W = Vocalized 'What?'" like so:   S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|  B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| V |----|----|----|----||W---|----|W---|----| W = Vocalized “What?”	Create a modified drum tab. Create and label additional lines for additional sounds. Create a symbol for each original sound.
Tires are also essential in boosting your car’s appearance. Besides the ability to give your car a sleek and sporty appearance, owning a good set of tires can definitely improve the acceleration and handling of a vehicle.  Having the perfect set of wheels can definitely make your car standout from the crowd. It is as important as choosing the ideal type of tires for your ride. It is available in different finishes such as alloy, chrome, gunmetal, forged and the basic black rims.

This is called the mise-en-scene, a French term that roughly translates to visual storytelling.   Keeping in mind that what you see in the scene is not the entire location but only what the director has decided to show, ask yourself why the director chose to show this part of the location and not another. This works equally well for scenes shot on a sound stage rather than on location, because the set will only comprise a part of the location it represents. Note which characters and objects are in the center of the scene and which are in the background or periphery. Study which parts of the scene are out of focus and whether this changes during the scene. Pay attention to how the scene is lit. Note whether it is brightly lit or in shadow and whether the light has a particular hue. Think about how the scene might play if the lighting is changed.	Pay careful attention to how what you see in the scene helps to tell the story.
Any type of synthetic faux fur should do.  You can use less if you want to make short boot covers instead of leg warmers that extend to your knees.    Measure the circumference at the top of your shin. You will want the area just below the knee. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the measurement to ensure the elastic is not too tight. Measure the circumference at the widest part of your calf. Measure the area at the bottom. If you want it to cover various sizes of boots as well as legs, try a 22-inch (56 cm) measurement. Measure the length of your leg from just under the anklebone to the top of your shin.  They should be as wide as the length of your leg and as long as the circumference at the widest point at your calf. Give yourself 1/2 inch extra in length to account for seams.  Measure 3 horizontal lines at approximately ankle, mid-calf and an inch below the top of the shin.  Pin it closer together at the ankle and top of the shin, if your measurements were drastically different. This will ensure a tight fit. , Pin the 2 sides together as close to the edge as possible. Sew the vertical length of the leg warmer.   Faux fur should hide the seam. You can also wrap the leg warmer into a loop and sew as far in as you can on the sewing machine. You may need to hand sew the middle portion, if you cannot sew all the way down to the bottom without sewing through your leg opening. You do not need to sew the top or bottom edges when using acrylic fabrics. , Wear over tights or boots.	Find a ream of fluffy, plush material at your local fabric store. Buy 1 yard (1 m) of fabric. Take measurements with a fabric measuring tape. Cut 2 pieces of plush faux fur. Lay the material on a flat table with the inside out. Pin 3 lengths of elastic across these lines. Sew the 3 lengths down, stretching the elastic as you go.  , Fold the leg warmer in half. Repeat with the second leg warmer.

The most common way of watching movies is usually streaming them instantly on the Internet, or downloading movies temporarily for a rental fee. You can watch on a mobile device, your computer, or by hooking up a Network Media Player to your television (discussed in the next method). You can watch high-qualify video without even leaving the house, provided your computer is outfitted with the following:   1.5 megabits per second speed is usually necessary for regular viewing, while 5.0 is needed for HD viewing. If you want to upgrade the speed of your Internet connection, talk to your cable provider. The HTML5 plug-in is also necessary to use Netflix and most other streaming services. This should come standard with the most recent update of most browsers. Update your software to the most recent version, if necessary.; , Make sure your computer has the right system requirements for streaming high qualify video quickly, or you may end up watching slow-buffering grainy VHS-quality movies. 1080p content on most streaming services should be compatible with iPads 3rd generation or later and Apple TV 3rd generation or later. Mac and PC requirements are discussed below:   Mac Requirements  Mac OS X v10.5 or later iTunes 10 or later 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor At least 1 GB of RAM A display that supports HDCP with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher   Windows Requirements  32 or 64-bit version of Windows 7 or Windows 8; Windows XP and Vista don't support HDCP iTunes 10 or later 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor At least 1 GB of RAM A video driver that supports HDCP (you may need to check with the manufacturer to determine if your video driver supports HDCP) A display that supports HDCP with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher with a digital connection (DVI, DisplayPort, or HDMI)    , Renting a movie is a snap if you subscribe to a video streaming service, for a monthly fee. Many of them have a huge variety of new and old content for you to browse, and playing the video is as easy as selecting and pushing play. All you need to do to get started is navigate to the homepage of the streaming service you're interested in and open an account. Common streaming services include:   Netflix Amazon Prime Vudu Hulu Plus  , If you've already got an iTunes account, you can rent a movie right now. The biggest difference between renting from iTunes or GooglePlay and a streaming service, is that you'll download the content for a limited period of time to watch it, before it will disappear. You can view the content on the computer and other mobile devices you've set up to be compatible with the service.   If you don’t have an account and want to start one, start one by navigating to the website and adding your ID and billing information. You'll have to download the software to get started, and then you'll be ready to select among the music and video available. Since you’re downloading, this is typically a better option if you’ve got a relatively slow Internet connection. It might take you a while to download the content, but you’ll be able to watch it without having to pause while the video buffers and catches up.  Whether you're using Netflix, iTunes, or some other streaming or online rental service, you can browse through the available options and select a video of your choice. Most services allow you to read a synopsis, user reviews, and browse recommended content based on your prior viewing choices and your own reviews. Look for something interesting and select it to play.   If you've got a particular title in mind, you can search for it in the search bar by title, names of the director or the actors, or a specific genre if you want to browse around. If you don't have a title in mind, look at the most recent popular options for new videos you might not have seen yet. Take a few minutes to rate some of your favorite movies to give the service a chance to recommend a lost classic you may have missed.  If you're streaming your content, it might need some time to load, depending on how fast your Internet connection is. At peak periods–in the early evening–lots of basic Internet connections will slow considerably, and streaming multiple devices at the same time can also slow the speed by a substantial amount. If you're struggling with your speed, talk to your cable provider to learn about upgrades, and take steps yourself to improve the streaming quality.   Try to only stream one device at a time. Pause any other downloads or online browsers you have open and let all the streaming capacity go straight to the video you're watching. If you're still experiencing struggles, pause the video and leave it a lone for a while to catch up.	Make sure you have the necessary connection speed and plug-ins for streaming movies. Check your system requirements for video. Subscribe to a video streaming rental service online. Rent movies directly from iTunes or GooglePlay. Select a video. Let the video buffer, if necessary.
Before you can attend an anime convention or "con", you will need to find one that fits your interests and your budget. There are many anime conventions throughout the world and in North America. Some cons are massive events with thousands of people in attendance for several days of fun. Others are smaller events where you have a smaller crowd and can experience the con in a few hours. You should consider how much you can afford to spend on travel for the con and how much you want to take in at the con.Bigger conventions have a longer list of things to do but they can be overwhelming for first time attendees. You may want to go to a specific anime convention to see an anime celebrity or to experience a particular sub genre of anime with other attendees. You can research different anime conventions at Animecons.com, which lists almost every anime convention in the world by region, country, and state. You can also look at the ten largest anime conventions in North America on Animecons.com. Some of the largest anime conventions include the Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California, the Anime North in Toronto, Ontario, and Anime Central in Rosemont, Illinois.; , You should determine how much money you, and any companions coming with you, can afford to spend on the anime convention. At the minimum, you will need to budget for the anime convention badge, buying food, purchasing anime merchandise, and preparing your cosplay, if you are doing one. If you decide to travel for an anime convention, you will need to budget for transportation to and from the con as well as accommodations.Smaller anime conventions usually cost around $30 for a pre-registered badge. Larger conventions can cost $50-$60 for a badge. You may also need to factor renting a hotel room or a home stay, as well as transportation, such as airplane tickets or parking and gas for a car. You may decide to go with friends or a partner to cut down on the costs of the anime convention, especially if you are on a tight budget.  You should always try to pre-register for anime cons, as it will cost you less to attend and you will get to wait in a shorter line to pick up your badge. If you decide to pre-register, you should make sure you are able to attend as most anime con badges are non-refundable and non-transferable.You should also be sure that you are able to attend all three days of the anime convention, if you are going to a larger convention, before you pre-register. You may need to request days off at work or clear your schedule on the convention days so you have enough time to experience the convention. If you do not pre-register for the anime convention, you can still pick up your pass at the door. But it will likely be more expensive and you will have to wait in a longer line.  Once you have your anime convention badge, you should consider whether you will need to travel to get to the convention and if so, how you are going to get there. Will you have to fly or can you drive to the convention? Driving may be cheaper, but you should factor in the cost of parking and gas to ensure it is a budget friendly option. You may have to fly if the convention is far from where you live, as you may not want to spend too much of your free time commuting to the convention by car.You should check for flight deals online in the weeks or months leading up to the convention. You may want to give yourself a buffer of one day before the convention or arrive the night before so you can get settled in your accommodations before the convention starts. You should consider other transportation options like taking the train or the bus, especially if you are on a tight budget. You should factor in the travel time that will be required if you take the train or the bus and make sure it is worth the effort.  If you are traveling outside of your home area for the convention, you will need accommodations. You may go for a hotel or a motel, especially if you are traveling with companions and you can split the cost of the room. Or, you may see if you have friends you can stay with for a few nights during the convention to cut costs.You should check with the anime convention to see if they have reserved hotel rooms for attendees close to the convention center. Some larger anime cons offer discounted rates to attendees. These rooms tend to fill up fast so try to reserve them right after you buy your badge or as soon as they become available. Most hotels require you to be at least 18-21 years of age to book a hotel room. You are usually allowed no more than four people per a room. If you are trying to save money, you may decide to split the hotel room four ways.  A cosplay is a costume in the style of an anime character. You may buy a cosplay or make your own cosplay at home. You should start making your cosplay costume early so it is ready in time for the convention. Get friends or parents to help you put together your cosplay and have fun making your own version of a beloved anime character.Make sure your costume is appropriate for a potentially crowded con if you are going to a larger anime convention. Try to avoid long trailing pieces of clothing that could easily be stepped on or large accessories on your back that could hit people as you turn around. Your costume should allow you to move around easily and see reasonably well. If your costume does limit your vision, recruit a friend to escort you around the con and try to stay aware of your surroundings. If you're cosplaying, practice poses in costume beforehand. That way you'll be ready to strut your stuff when people ask to photograph you - and they will if your cosplay is halfway decent!  , You should make sure you pack the essentials for the con, or a convention survival kit, so you are prepared. You should include several key items in your convention survival kit, including:   A sewing kit, duct tape, and markers to make emergency repairs on your cosplay. This way, if your cosplay gets damaged, you can fix it easily and quickly. Loose cash to spend on food and souvenirs. You may want to set a budget so you do not spend too much money on clothing, posters, DVDs, books, and other merchandise at the con. A camera and extra batteries or a plug in charger. You will likely be taking lots of pictures of other cosplays and anime celebrities, so make sure your camera is always charged and ready to go. Photo ID with you as well as loose cash and a debit or credit card. Water and snacks for when you get hungry between meals, as well as sunscreen. You may end up lining up outside to get into the venue and you do not want to get a sunburn in the process., Most anime cons have a schedule of events on their website a few weeks before the con starts. You should read the convention guide and highlight events or celebrities you would like to see. You may collaborate with your companions to make sure you all see who and what you want during the con.You should also make sure you have enough time throughout the day to see everything. You may block off your schedule and make a plan day by day. You can then adjust the schedule once you get to the con, if necessary. You should look at the list of food options on the convention’s website or around the convention. This way, you know what to expect for food options and can budget accordingly. You may end up bringing food with you or eating at your accommodations to save money.  If you are not cosplaying, you should make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes and walking shoes, as you will likely be on your feet most of the day. The convention may be hot once you are inside the venue, so you may want to dress in layers to stay comfortable.You should make sure your cellphone is fully charged and your camera is fully charged. If you are with friends, you should exchange numbers so you can find each other in the event you get separated or lost.  You should plan to arrive at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before the anime convention opens so you can get in the line. This will also give you enough time to pick up your badge in the convention and experience all the events at the con.You should also be sure to arrive early for events that you know are going to be popular, such as a meet and greet with an anime celebrity. Lining up early will ensure you use your time at the convention well and increase your chances of getting into popular events.  You and your friends may end up having different events or booths that you want to check out. You may end up splitting up and agree to meet back later at a particular spot in the convention center. Make sure you all have each other’s contact information and an agreed upon meeting spot and time. The con may be very crowded so this will prevent you all from losing each other.  You may be going to the anime convention to look at other people’s cosplay and get merchandise of your favorite manga. Or you may go to the con to show off your cosplay and bond with other cosplaying attendees. Try to socialize with others at the con and be friendly with other attendees.You may get pictures with anime celebrities or request a picture of someone’s cosplay. Try to give cosplayers room when you are walking around the convention so their cosplay does not get damaged. Have fun and try to experience the con to the fullest.	Research anime conventions in your area. Select a convention based on your budget. Register early. Determine your transportation to the convention. Decide if you will need accommodations for the convention. Prepare a cosplay. Create a convention survival kit. Read the convention guide and make a schedule of events. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Arrive early. Split up if you have different interests than your companions. Socialize with other convention attendees.
Your name has got to be memorable and easy to say in a song or an interview. Longer names are difficult to remember, so shoot instead for one or two syllables. Even rappers with longer names usually have shortened versions (Notorious B.I.G → "Biggie," Lupe Fiasco → "Lupe," etc.)   Ex. Nas, Snoop Dogg, Big Boi, Common; , Names that roll off the tongue are easier to remember. Thinking of the best raps names, from Rakim to Del the Funkee Homosapien, and note how they sound out-loud. The are memorable, musical, and easily rhymed.   The easiest way to do this is with matching sounds, such as in Eminem and KidD Cudi.  Many rappers use monikers that are slight variations on their actual name or initials. Some rappers, like Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West, even use their names outright.   Eminem is a play on Marshall Mathers real initials (M&M). Lupe Fiasco's name, in part, comes from his given first name Wasalu. Lil' Wayne was born Dwayne Carter.  Oftentimes the most effective rap names come from real life. A good rap name is not only catchy but personal, capturing your style in a word or two, so nicknames are the perfect place for inspiration.   Snoop Dogg's mother called him "Snoopy" as a child Waka Flocka Flame was nicknamed "Waka" by his younger cousin while watching Fozzy Bear from The Muppets. Rapper, The Game was called "Game" as a kid because he loved playing sports.  Hip-hop has always been a genre that takes old trends and influences and remixes them in the present, so it should be no surprise that   Jay-Z, known as "Jazzy" as a kid, changed his name to Jay-Z as a salute to his hero, producer Jay-O. 50 Cent chose his name as a reference to friend and fellow hustler Kelvin "50 Cent" Darnell Martin.  Sometimes the best names come from the mundane, commenting on who and what you are everyday. Think of your passions, goals, and rap style and use them for inspiration.   Ghostface Killah got his name from his favorite kung-fu villain. 2 Chainz chose his name because "In my 8th grade yearbook picture I had on two chains," and it stuck.French Montana, who hails from the ex-French colony of Morocco, moved to America and picked up the last name of fictional drug dealer Tony Montana from Scarface.  Acronyms have a long history in hip-hop, from Common's classic song "I Used to Love H.E.R." to Kendrick's masterpiece album "Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City." If you use an acronym, choose something that is easy to say and think hard about what each letter should mean.   Big K.R.I.T. stands for "King Remembered in Time." A$AP Rocky, and all the A$AP crew, have said that the name stands for "Always Strive and Prosper." M.I.A. stands for "Missing in Action." Not only is this a tribute to her cousin who went missing, but a reference to the London neighborhood, Action, where she grew up.  A name with some sort of deeper meaning implies that the rapper's songs have deeper meaning. Kendrick Lamar is on record saying that he chose to use his real name because he "raps about real things," for example. His name is symbolic of his style.Rapsody is a play on both "rap" and the word "rhapsody," which means "an epic poem." Wix Khalifa got his name from his Arabic uncle, whose name means knowledge, and the Arabic word "khalifa." which means successor.Raekwon the Chef chose his name because he sees writing as a form of cooking, mixing up metaphors like ingredients.  There are additions to rap names that have been common for years and are used by many rappers for nicknames. Some potential additions to your name include:   MC Lil' Big The DJ, Rap collectives like N.W.A, Black Hippy, or Mobb Deep still need to come up with a name that is unique, short, and symbolic.   Wu-Tang Clan takes it's name from the group's shared love of old kung-fu movies. The Roots references a book and television series exploring the history of slavery in America, which fits their social conscious songs and message. The Pro Era name comes from a popular line of clothing and the idea that the rappers are ushering in a new age of professionalism.	Keep your name short. Find a name that is memorable and melodic. Play with your actual name. Brainstorm nicknames from your life. Pay tribute to your influences. Find influence from your everyday life. Use acronyms to pack hidden meaning into your name. Make your name symbolic. Add common rap handles to your name. Remember that the same rules apply for rap groups.
Sew the bedsheet and lining fabric together along the bottom edge of the skirt (the wider part of the semicircle) with the bed sheet fabric facing inward. Remove the pins and flip the skirt inside out.  Unpin the bottom 2 pins from the zipper so you can match the edges of the skirt to the edges of the shirt. Sometimes there will be some excess skirt material, so simply cut the excess fabric off of the skirt.  Make sure the pleats are small so they don't make the flow of the skirt look boxy.   Make sure the pleats are evenly spaced around the skirt. User your vinyl tape measure to double-check. Grasp the fabric and fold it over to the right as though you were starting to make a fan. Pin the folded section of fabric down so that it will stay in position. Iron the pleat to make it precise. Sew the pleats using downward stitches. Stop at the point where you want the skirt to twirl freely.  Make sure that the dress is folded inside-out to make your seam less visible.  Sew the back seam of the skirt up to 1/4" (6 mm) above where the end of the zipper would fall. Pin the zipper's final few inches down the back of the skirt, and sew it into place.	Make the skirt. Pin the skirt to the bottom of the shirt. Add 4 pleats to the top of your skirt, placing 2 in front and 2 in back. Sew the skirt to the shirt. Add the zipper.
Surviving after a major apocalyptic event is not going to be short term since the entire country or the world is likely to be falling apart––there are no two ways around that reality. However, hopefully having three months of supplies will get you settled and going with your new self-sufficient habits. The more time you have dedicated to forming a plan when disaster 'does strike, the better. When preparing the supplies, think in two categories: basic survival and getting by, as outlined in the following two steps.; , Consider storing the following:   Jugs of water Canned goods Vacuum-sealed goods Blanket and pillow Medications A weapon that you actually know how to use properly A knife (in addition to a weapon) Warm, long sleeved clothing (if your climate requires it) Carrying bag (for moving and/or fleeing).  Think about having these items at your disposal:   Batteries Flashlights Matches Pot (for cooking or boiling water) Plastic eating-ware (plate, mug, spoon, fork) Rope or twine Map Permanent markers (something to write with) Change of clothes Can opener Lighters Camp stove and propane Hatchet or axe First aid book Sunglasses Duct tape Glow sticks Boots Extra pants Smartphone Water filters Other comfort items.  Whether you're on the lookout from cannibals, flesh-eating super-bacteria, zombies, or a meteor, you'll need to think about your health. Here's a list for what you need to put in your emergency kit:Adhesive bandages, such as Band-Aids Gauze Medical tape Antibiotics (not for the zombie virus but for normal bacteria) Antiviral drugs (not for the zombie virus but for normal viruses) Ibuprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)) Acetaminophen/paracetamol (over-the-counter pain relief) Antihistamine Aspirin (over-the-counter pain relief) Laxative Iodine Potassium Iodine Hand sanitizing liquid Candles A multi-use tool (aka a "hobo tool") Phone charger (preferably solar) Wood for burning Towels Life jackets, if your area is prone to flooding Extra warm clothes Paper towels Solar charger (see below) Pet food (enough for 30-90 days) Tweezers Plasters Safety pins Thermometer Superglue Toothpicks/needles.  You'll be dealing with everything from cuts to dysentery. Hospitals will cease existing and simple problems will seem a lot more daunting. If you or a family member has a specific ailment, stockpile medications for that, too.  That's a nice way of saying, "Everybody poops." To keep hygiene from being an issue on top of everything else, pack the following:   Toilet paper (a couple rolls will suffice) Menstrual products Toothbrush and toothpaste Plastic garbage bags and ties Shovel or trowel Bleach Soap and shampoo  , Everyone in the household and close family and friends should have a communication system to communicate with family and friends. Communicate secret locations with your family members and friends using the radio.   Keep batteries with your radio. The last thing you want is to presume you're prepared when you're really not. And if you have a loved one you're taking care of, make sure they have a radio and you're not keeping both of them for the two of you. When all else fails, work out how you will contact each other. This is when your permanent markers will come in handy. If the apocalypse strikes and you have left the house, write down where you are going, when you left, and if/when you'll be back on the wall, on a rock, on a nearby car, wherever you can find.  Hoarding gasoline won't work; the chemicals that once kept it fresh will degrade it in time. After a year or so, it goes bad. Chances are gas stations will run out of gasoline but there could be some diesel left. In addition, all military diesels can run on other fuels as well, from rotten kerosene to fermented leaves. So invest in something that can handle the harder fuels.   In said vehicle, it's equally as likely that you'll be in it when all breaks loose, so pack a survival kit to keep in your car as well. Is there such a thing as being too prepared? If this isn't an option, make sure you have a bicycle laying around somewhere that's fully functioning. There will be a point when you need to cover large distances in a short amount of time.  Knowing how to work a gun is going to keep you from either dying or being voted off the island.. And while you're at it, buy a couple (if you haven't already).Regardless of who or what you'll be facing, this is probably a good idea. Anything menacing needs to be kept far, far away. Whatever or whoever your enemy, shooting them will probably increase your chances of not being attacked or eaten.  Unless the apocalypse is due to some bacteria that's floating around in the air. In that case, get a gas mask. The people/zombies/menacing forces will probably still see you as an enemy.    Master the art of the snare trap. If you're really scrappy with it, you need nothing but what nature provides you. If you're on the ocean or near a body of water, get to fishing or fly fishing. Your stock of baked beans and Spaghetti O's certainly isn't going to start spawning miraculously. Take a hint from Katniss and start honing your archery skills. Once you've got a reason, learn how to make your own bow.  Take the time to read through wikiHow's disaster preparedness section. Read every novel on every version of apocalypse you can. Even though such novels are "fiction", reading about how the characters scavenge for food, retain water, and find shelter might just be the thing to save your life.However, do not rely on these as your only preparation.   Examples of books to read include: The Road by Cormac McCarthy, Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven, Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, Stephen King's The Stand, and The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham are all great places to start (even if the apocalypse doesn't end up coming anytime soon). You've already read The Hunger Games, right?  , If we're all honest with ourselves, what kind of world could we recreate without others?   For most of us, not much. Can you make a battery from a lemon? Or a potato clock? Lowering the bar... how are you at tying knots?  , Taking car batteries and daisy chaining them will act as an energy storage device, but you're going to need to generate power. A generator running on wood, gas or a diesel engine where you can make your own fuel is good, but the real payoff is using renewable energy by making your own wind turbine out of PVC pipes and a car alternator or scavenging some solar panels near a highway. When the events do take a turn for the worst, at least you'll be able to be productive at night and have some of the luxuries of your former life.   Having electricity in your safe house will keep the lights on and keep electronics running. Electricity is important to run power tools, welders, water/fuel pumps, radio equipment as well as charge any portable item or comfort item you may wish to use. It'll be a surprising source of morale, too.	Gather sufficient supplies to survive for 90 days. Obtain and stockpile basic survival (the most important) items. Store supplies for just getting by. Prepare an emergency kit. Keep yourself healthy against everything. Plan how to prepare for the messier sides of the long-term. Set up a communication system. Use diesel-powered vehicles. Become a good shot. Learn how to hunt. Read up on disaster preparedness. Become less dependent. Find a way to generate your own electricity.
Some online retailers may retain older stocks of toys or will know how to source them for you. Check out stores that specialize in online toy sales, and more specifically, that have a focus on discontinued toy lines, to see what they have on offer. It is also a good idea to check out stores that carry used toys in good condition.   You can use a site such as Flipkart or Andromeda.; , There are quite a few of these around the world, and there is a big possibility that someone, somewhere is selling that toy you're after. The trick is to not look just in your own backyard, but to search worldwide. Some auction sites are international, while some are country-specific. This means that while you'll likely have no problems finding things on the international sites, be sure to also check sites available in the countries where the item was originally manufactured, especially if this is not China.   Some sellers specialize in selling discontinued or hard-to-find toys through sites such as eBay and Etsy.  Such sites may have forums, trading places and other ways to connect with fellow fans or collectors of the toy you're after. Be prepared to either pay a fair price, plus shipping, or to give something of equal value in exchange.  Sites that allow giveaways, such as Freecycle, are great places to check for old toys. Join up, then browse through the lists of freebies available in your area. If nothing is showing up that is relevant, place a "Wanted" request and wait. Someone may just have the toy you're after.  These are the stores in out of way places, such as the countryside or a suburb with mostly elderly residents. They may still carry stocks long exhausted in the larger urban areas. Do a phone around of such stores, including country or rural toy stores to see whether they have old stock not yet sold. You can even extend this search to stores in other countries, where the toy may not have sold out as quickly or have been as popular as your own country.  The item will likely be used but in many cases, you can often find old toys in good condition. In lucky cases, the item might even still be in its box, unused. However, this is a very "hit and miss" method, so you'll need to have a good eye for sifting through junk boxes and prepare to be disappointed a lot of the time.  If the stores stock toys, there is a chance that your toy might be there, especially if it's a collectible. To save time, it can be easier to call the store first. If it turns out that they stock the items, head on down to check out their supplies; if not, keeping phoning around.  If they deal in toys, it is possible that they might have your toy if it was discontinued in recent years.  They might have online catalogs or it might be easier to call and ask if they have the toy coming up for auction and whether they know of a collector who might be willing to sell one.  These are fun, so you can plan to go to one just to enjoy it. It might be a good opportunity to find that old toy. In many cases, there is a premium placed on the condition of the toy, including coming with its original box or packaging, so if that's what you're after, toy auctions are a great choice.  Sometimes old toys get caught up in storage places or become part of liquidated assets of failed businesses. This is a long shot, as it requires turning up to all sorts of auctions that don't identify the stock necessarily, but if you like rummaging and think auctions are fun, you just never know what might turn up. If toys are mentioned, it might be worth going; even if all you get is something cool to trade with.	Visit online stores that sell toys. Look on major auction or trading sites. Check out trade or swap sites run by collectors or fans. Check out freebie sites. Check toy stores that are more out of the way or "stuck in time". Check thrift, charity or opportunity stores. Check secondhand or antique stores. Check out wholesalers that sell discontinued stock. Check out which auction houses deal with toys. Visit toy auctions. Check out storage auctions or liquidation auctions.
Use a vacuum cleaner's hose attachment and work carefully.  Manufacturers have been making quieter case fans as well as power supply units and CPU coolers with less noisy fans.   Unplug case fans to be replaced. Unscrew fans with a flat-head screwdriver. Screw in new case fans. Plug in the new fans' power connectors. Unhook or spring a lever to remove a CPU cooler. You may need to gently pry the cooler off with the screwdriver. Wipe old thermal compound off the CPU with a rag. Apply a thin, fresh layer of thermal compound. Install the new cooler according to its manufacturer's instructions. Plug in the power connector for the new cooler to the motherboard. Detach power leads connecting the power supply unit to the computer. Take out the unit's mounting screws from the back of the computer case. Support the power supply unit if it is not resting on a bracket before removing the last screw. Slide out the unit. Replace with a new unit. Put the screws back in and reconnect the power leads. , Some systems allow you to alternately power or shut down 1 or more fans as needed. You can also set your hard drives to power down sooner after a period of inactivity.	Remove the computer's case to vacuum dust from inside the unplugged computer. Replace loud computer fans. Put the computer's case back on and ensure it is tight.  , Change your operating system's settings to lessen fan or power use.
The shuttle cover is located below the needle. If you find the metal plate where the needle pushes through with the thread, then you should see the shuttle cover on one side of the machine., The bobbin casing is located just inside the shuttle cover. It will look like a metal cylinder., Slide out the bobbin. If your bobbin is secured within the casing, then you may have to open the casing first., The spool pin is a piece on your sewing machine that holds the thread while you wind the bobbin. It will be a cylindrical piece that fits the hole in the spool of thread.The spool pin is commonly located on the top or side of the machine.  Start the spool or remove the end of the thread from the hook so that you can easily transfer thread from the spool once it's secured to the spool pin.  The spool pin should fit through the center of your thread.   If it has a spool cap, place that on top of the thread to hold it in place. If your machine’s spool pin is on top of the machine, it may not have a spool cap.  Most machines have a piece with a small hole near the spool that helps you guide the thread either when winding a bobbin or when threading the machine. If your machine does not have a thread guide, then skip this step., Your machine will have a small metal piece that will convey the thread as it’s wound around the bobbin. This piece should be near the thread guide and will look like a tiny knob., Your thread should form a triangle when held taut, with the top of the triangle located at the tension disk. Don't let go of your thread., Your bobbin should have a tiny hole in the side. Some bobbins have several. Push the end of your thread through the hole in your bobbin. You only need to push the thread through one hole on one side.If your bobbin has more than one hole in it, you can use any of the holes.  The bobbin winder is a cylindrical metal piece that looks similar to the spool pin and is about the size of the hole in the center of your bobbin. Next to the bobbin winder, you should see a round plastic piece., Line up the bobbin winder with the hole in the center of the bobbin and push the bobbin down onto the winder., Push the bobbin winder toward the plastic disk next to the winder. When the your winder is securely in place, you should hear a click., As you start to wind the bobbin, hold the end of the thread that you looped through the hole in your bobbin to keep it from slipping back out., Continuing working your pedal as your bobbin fills with thread. Move at a comfortable speed.You may want to start by pushing your pedal slowly to find your rhythm, but there’s no reason to wind your bobbin at a slow speed. If your bobbin fills unevenly, you have likely wound your thread around the tension disk in the wrong spot. Check your placement of the thread. If you believe you have done it correctly, then wrap it a second time to ensure that your thread is winding evenly.If your thread catches on the notch of the spool, try turning the spool over and working in the opposite direction of that notch.  You may be unsure of how much thread you’ll use, but it’s a good idea to fill up your bobbin each time you wind it so that you don’t run out of thread.Your bobbin is full when you reach the edges of the sides of the bobbin, making your thread flush with the outside edge. If you keep loading your bobbin past the sides, then the thread will slide off and unwind.  Use your scissors to disconnect the thread between your bobbin and the spool. Be careful to not let go of the end of your thread on the bobbin so that it doesn’t start to unwind., You will again hear a click when the winder is securely in place., Your bobbin is now full of thread and ready to use.	Open the shuttle cover. Pull out the bobbin casing. Remove the bobbin from the casing. Find the spool pin. Loosen your thread. Place your spool of thread on the spool pin. Slide the end of your thread through the thread guide. Locate your machine’s tension disk. Wrap the thread around the tension disk once. Thread your bobbin. Find your bobbin winder. Put your bobbin on the winder. Lock your bobbin winder. Hold the end of the thread. Push down on your foot pedal. Fill up your bobbin with thread. Cut the thread. Push the bobbin winder back into the start position. Remove the bobbin from the winder.
Even if you know the story like the back of your hand, you still need to write it down. Include every detail you'd like to include in the song. This step sounds simple but once you start becomes very difficult when you try to include everything. Keep it short enough to turn into lyrics unless you plan on writing a hip hop ballad.; , Underline the details that correspond to the important parts. Take out all the unimportant bits that won't be going into the song, and then rewrite it onto another sheet of paper if you'd like, to keep it clean.  Make sure it rhymes, and put each stanza together so that it forms one long poem. These will be the verses to your song, since they tell the story well.  This is a little harder, since the chorus usually doesn't tell a story- it basically sums it up. Stop and think: what is the main feeling you want the story to give? If it's a happy song about something encouraging, try to write a stanza describing that happiness. If it tells the story of a break up, make the chorus a reflection of the feelings you had going through the break up.  A pre-chorus is just a short couple of lines that comes before the chorus but isn't actually part of the chorus. An example of a pre-chorus would be in Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me," when she sings "she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's cheer captain..." until it reaches the chorus. This step is optional.  Generally this is only 1-2 lines that repeat over a few times towards the end of the song. The bridge doesn't have to have anything to do with the chorus- you could make it focus on a certain part of the story, or the entire story at once.  Figure out the order in which you're going to put the verses and the chorus. A popular form is Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Verse, Chorus.  Now that you have the actual lyrics, put them to a tune or ask someone else to write one for you if you struggle with it. Once you have a tune, you can sing your very own song and share it with others! Congratulations- you have just written your very own hip hop song based on a story!	Write out your story. Take a highlighter and highlight the 2-4 most important parts. Write one stanza (usually 4-6 lines) for each main detail of the story. The next step is to think of the chorus. Write out a pre-chorus if you feel the song needs one. Write the bridge to the song. Decide on a song format. Write a catchy tune!
Hold the peridot up to a light source. Note how clear the body of the gem appears as light passes through it. Discard any that appear cloudy.Quality gems may have very small lines or marks running through them, but this is common. Although there are gems out there that are completely free of any blemishes, these are very rare.  Expect peridot to come in a variety of shapes, from round to oval to square and beyond. Whatever shape it has been cut in, inspect the surface for imperfections in its symmetry or design. Discard any that appear to be cut irregularly.Peridot is not a rare stone, so a poorly cut one has far less value than another with more precise cuts. One exception might be a gem that is totally transparent under a microscope, without any of fine lines that run through most specimens. Such stones are very rare. Alternately, if you can afford it, you could purchase a large, roughly shaped stone and hire a jeweler to recut it more precisely., Check the gem’s weight, or “carat.” Expect most to range from 0.5 to 4 CTW (carat total weight). Expect the price to rise along with its weight, so for a stone with a higher value, go with a higher carat.Remember, though, that peridot is a very common stone. Because of this, more emphasis is placed on a perfect cut. Therefore, a misshapen peridot with 1.0 CTW isn’t necessarily worth more than a perfectly symmetrical one at 0.5 CTW.	Check how clear the gem is. Look for expert cuts. Decide on a carat.
Think that you are better than other people but do not go overboard. Acknowledge the fact that you will lose at times and there will be people with skills and techniques that are way better than yours.   If you want to be arrogant, try practicing as well to let your skills do the talking. Do stamina training, sit ups for the stomach and push ups for the arms. Adjust your timetable, practice tennis and get your level of fitness up. Tip: Create ingenious names for your techniques. Seriously, does "Super Ultra Great Delicious Mountain Storm" even give you the chills? How about the "Super Great Momoshiro Special?" If you want to be cool and arrogant, stick to your great play and techniques with daunting names. (PS: No offense meant Kintaro-kun and Momo senpai! But seriously, pfft.)      ; , Listen more and try to get it right the first time. It is easier said than done but really, if you want to be like Echizen Ryoma, watch and learn stuffs in one hell of an observation. (You could learn a thing or two from beloved Atobe's Insight and Atobe Kingdom. Brace yourself though as you probably might be awed at the sight of his prowess.  Do not lose yourself amid any situation. Practice meditation and always focus on keeping your composure. (Oh and by meditation, it means you always have to drink a can of Ponta to keep your cool. Formula: a can of aspartame = damaged brain cells which will lead to a calm state of mind)  , Beat all the challenges that come your way with determination and show that you are not afraid of anything. (Tip: You might want to learn from Rikkaidai's mother-captain, Yukimura Seiichi or from the venerable buchou of Fudomine, Tachibana Kippei. They most certainly embody the essence of high admiration as seen from their respective teams.)  , Like Ryoma Echizen, do not be afraid to take on any challenge no matter what it is or who you might face.  Study hard o-chibi!  , Remember that you will go far kid. Surpass your senpais and become a real prince of tennis!  , Watch The Prince of Tennis and try to dress and speak like Ryoma. You might want to be careful on speaking like Ryoma though. You do not want your enemies to build up.  Remember that Ryoma's fave subject is Science not English. (He is just good in English since he was born in America.)  , Ryoma's are: "mada mada dane."	Be arrogant. Try to Become a Quick Learner. Learn to be calm. Gain respect. Be brave. Improve Your Knowledge. Do not waver. Watch the anime. You got to love Science. Come up with a personal quote or a famous word.

Slow down steadily by easing off the throttle.         , Maintain a straight path. Come to a complete stop.         , Push your motorcycle as far as you can out of oncoming traffic. Inspect the damage to your motorcycle.         , Call a friend or the closest towing service.
You’ll probably find smaller windows easier to work with than large ones.   Junkyards and reclamation yards are a good place to start looking. Ebay usually has some old lots of windows for sale by collection. Or you could just start checking dumpsters in your neighborhood.; , If you are using old windows, you need to be aware of some hazards such as splintered wood and nails sticking out.   Check your window carefully before handling it and be sure to use tough gloves.       Be very cautious handling glass, especially if any panes are broken. Some panes may be loose. It will be safer if you can make these secure by using a window sealant before you begin working with your window creatively.  You need to be cautious of woodworms and termites if you are bringing second hand furniture into your home.   Look out for little holes and piles of frass (termite excrement). Fumigation works best to get rid of them, or use a DIY chemical treatment, and seal up any holes.       If you leave the bugs in the wood, they will eat your art and possibly spread throughout your house.	Choose small windows to make creating your art easier. Make your windows safe before painting. Beware of bugs to make sure your art is not eaten.
Pliers are the one of the worst tools to bring into contact with your instrument. They can scratch and bend your mouthpiece, and using them might even start to break apart your instrument at the mouthpipe., A mouthpiece puller is a handy device that is solely intended to pull stuck mouthpieces out of brass instruments. They can be used for small and large instruments, so they are versatile enough to use on trumpets, trombones, tubas and so on. These are available online or in music stores.The most common mouthpiece pullers are:   Bobcat Mouthpiece Puller: This is the least expensive, costing about $40. This one has two screws that need to be tightened simultaneously when using it. Ferree G88 Mouthpiece Puller: This is a more expensive option, costing about $100. It is bulkier, but it only has one T handle that needs to be screwed in when being used. DEG Magnum Mouthpiece Puller: This is usually the most expensive puller, costing about $130. It is very similar to the Ferree.  You should have a level working space. Be careful to not put it near the edge where it can fall. Alternately, you can do this on the floor, especially if you have a large instrument.   You may want someone to help you by gently holding the instrument still while you operate the mouthpiece puller.  One end of the mouthpiece puller will go against the instrument at the point where you insert the mouthpiece. There are usually grooves or other U-shaped areas where your mouthpiece will fit into the puller.   Read the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure you are using the mouthpiece puller correctly.  Depending on the type of puller you are using, tighten the screws (on the Bobcat mouthpiece puller) or the T handle (on the Ferree G88 mouthpiece puller). Turn the screws evenly, steadily and slowly. The mouthpiece should start to move out of the instrument.  Once the mouthpiece puller has loosened the mouthpiece, you should be able to gently twist and pull to get it free. It should come out smoothly.   For mouthpieces that are really stuck, use a rubber mallet to tap the puller when it is tightened up. This might enable you to turn the screws a little more to help move the mouthpiece., The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.  If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded.	Never use pliers or other tools on your instrument. Buy or borrow a mouthpiece puller. Place your instrument on a table. Align the mouthpiece puller on the mouthpiece. Tighten the mouthpiece puller. Remove the mouthpiece. Inspect the mouthpiece for damage. Use a mouthpiece trueing tool.
You will usually find cracks in the corners of the bottom of the garage door when it's closed, as well as a rectangular hole somewhere else along the wall with nothing but wire closing it - that hole is for ventilation, to get "fresh" air from outside.; , Put one large piece of plywood over it, and nail that right outside of the hole where the wall touches the board. Only do this if the hole faces the direction you think the some is coming from.  Get some rubber patches and put them in any large gaps in the bottom corners. Staple, melt, glue or even just tape them to the rubber cushion above the gap.  While this won't remove any of the chemicals or gases found in car exhaust and tobacco smoke or raise the oxygen content, it will certainly make it color and smells will be less noticeable.  Open it a few minutes before going in the garage, so that it gets some cool air from inside your house.	Identify all air leaks. Board up the rectangular ventilation hole. Seal the bottom of the garage door. Set up a large fan in a spot in the garage. Get a doggy door in the door that connects your garage to your house, if they are connected.
When you're picking a vehicle to drag race, there are a lot of things to consider beyond how fast your vehicle can rip away from the starting line. Cost, your commitment to rebuilding an repairing the vehicle, and your ultimate ambitions for the car should be taken into account. Most drag racers want basically the same thing: a throaty beast of a dragster with a great paint job, equally great looking when parked in the lot, as it looks when its blowing past you in the passing lane.   Ideally, you want a light that's amenable to lots of modifications. A good dragster often has an engine modified with aftermarket cams, heads, and other components, to maximize the horsepower so it runs in excess of 600 or 700 HP. If you've got that, you'll have a muscle-monster. But for many drivers, anything beyond 500 HP is excessive. That's still an insanely fast car. Many aspiring dragsters probably have a frame or a model in mind when they're getting started, because of the look. A '57 Chevy Bel Air is a perfectly-great drag strip candidate for some classic-car enthusiasts, but for others that heavy frame might outweigh the style points.; , Hot-rodding for the drag strip is, above all else, a great nostalgia project. Get a hold of the Corvette model your dad always lusted after when you were a kid, painted sea-foam green, a car he never got to drive. Or maybe you want a Mustang just like the one Steve McQueen drove for the classic chase scenes in Bullitt. Maybe you want to go all-out and get an old Chevy Apache frame from the '40s and make a funny car to crack up the boys down at the track. There's no wrong choice, if you like the car.  Most cars that are successful on the strip are light in body and easy to work on. For this reason, you'll typically see a lot of Fox-body Mustangs built between the late 70s and early 90s, which are super-light and can take almost any engine you want to throw in it. Hemi? Flathead V-8? You can make it work in a Mustang body.Because Mustangs are almost ubiquitous at American tracks, they lose a little cache. They're great to work with, but do you really want to be another guy with the same looking car? Trans-Ams, Z28s, and Chargers all have similar characteristics, with great factory-built specs. The Charger McQueen drove was basically straight from the factory, with some suspension work done. If it was good enough for Bullitt…  , How fast do you want your car to go? What kind of engine do you want to build? What kind of engine can the body of your vehicle take? Much of the work and much of the fun that goes into planning a hot rod project will come with making these decisions for yourself.   A good drag engine should maximize horsepower, probably using some aftermarket modifications to maximize the efficiency of the engine. Hydraulic roller cams and aftermarket cylinder heads are a common modification.Depending on the engine, you should be able to use at least some of the factory components in the drivetrain to keep the project as affordable as possible. Try to set a limit for yourself. Sure, you can say you want to have a 1,000 HP dragon-breather going in that Trans-Am, but the cost of the all the aftermarket drive train components necessary? The stress upgrades necessary for the chassis? If you can get 500 HP at street-level, you won't have to worry about getting embarrassed at the track. Ever. Try to keep your ambitions practical, Mr. Andretti.  As you increase the power in your engine, the stock suspension will quickly become unsuitable. One of the most important modifications that you'll need to make in a serious drag racer is in the suspension. Make sure you upgrade the suspension after increasing the power, to make sure you match the stress specs to the new power of the vehicle.   If your dragster has rear leaf springs, consider upgrading to CalTrac bars to increase the stability and the control. If your rod comes with coil-spring suspension, using aftermarket control arms is the best approach. You can also check out the possibility of using "no-hop" to modify the geometrical center of the suspension, giving your more muscle in your starts. Some racers will unhook the front sway bar and install drag-style coil springs. Drag racing stresses the axles, making problems common, so it's a good idea to get shocks made for the purposes of standing up to the stress.  After the Fast and Furious movies, everybody and his brother wants to hit a nitrous button and blow the competition off their rear bumper. Using a small nitrous system for your races will allow you to use a more basic torque converted for driving on the street and the highway at normal speeds. It can also help keep your engine leaner, making it easier to run at a low compression ratio. Naturally-aspirated engines will require a bigger cam and will need to process higher-octane fuel if the compression ratio rises.  The more you modify the factory parts, the more problems you'll encounter from those modifications, especially if you're running your dragster rough and stressing the accelerator. Hot rods commonly have problems with overheating, making some precautions necessary. You might not have any problems if you've done your mods correctly, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for potential problem areas.    Install a bigger radiator to keep the vehicle from overheating and check your fuel pump regularly. Running your drag car aggressively will wear out these components very quickly. Make sure you have a sensitive an accurate heat gauge and monitor it closely when you're driving.  Most pro drag race vehicles are specially designed roadsters made to race at short distances, but hobbyists and weekend warriors have their own categories, as well. Vehicles are rated and classed based on a variety of information, including the advertised factory weight of the vehicle, the type of fuel used, and the horsepower of the engine. The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) boasts over 200 separate categories of vehicles, though the basic categories can be divided in two:    Top Fuel Dragsters have an almost-comical length of 20–30 feet (6.1–9.1 m), and upward of 10,000 HP, which run on nitromethane. These are the dragsters you'll likely find at pro races as a spectator. Top Alcohol Dragsters are similar to their Top Fuel cousins, though they run partially on methane.  Stock Dragsters started as factory vehicles and have been modified according to NHRA guidelines to improve HP and efficiency. On open-track days, this is typically the only kind of vehicle you'll find coming to the track, and probably what you're running if you're interested in drag racing. If you've got a modified muscle car, you can look up your vehicle on the NHRA Classification Guide.  If you want to drag race, you've got to do it on a racetrack under the proper conditions. Drag strips are usually a quarter-mile long, after which is a "speed trap" of about 70 feet (21.3 m), where your top speed will be measured.Many tracks will have open invitationals that anyone can show up for, as long as you pay the registration and track fees. Likewise, time trials are often available on a regular basis, if you want to get out and open the throttle a couple times.   When you arrive, you'll likely have to pay a small entrance fee, as well as a track fee if you plan to race. If you're going to race, the cost will depend on the class of vehicle you're racing, so it's a good idea to call first and find out about any costs before you show up.Go watch some races first and try to get a sense of the culture and the kinds of races that happen at the track you're thinking of racing. Talk to other racers and track officials to ask for advice. If you drive a Honda Civic and want to drag race, you might be able to enter into a Bracket-Style race with handicaps, but you might also feel a little out of place. Before you drive all the way to the track, take the time to check out a few races as a spectator first. Besides being a fun sport, it's a great community that you can be a part of from the bleachers, as well. Only drag race at approved sites. Drag racing in perfect professional conditions is dangerous enough, and drag racing in the street is downright suicidal. It's also illegal everywhere. Never drag race on the street.  To keep the playing field level, most tracks and racing organizations divide the field into a large number of different vehicle classes. After paying at the gate, you'll need to fill out a race card, filling out information about the class you'll be racing in, your name, and other specific information about your vehicle.   If you just have a factory-standard vehicle that you want to race, or have made minimal modifications to it, the class will still vary based on the size of the engine and other specifications.Many tracks will have open invitationals on a regular basis, at which you can register your car and find out what class and category your vehicle qualifies for, or what you need to do to get your vehicle to spec and race it, if you want. This is the easiest way to find out more about your class, if you're not sure.  Depending on what kind of vehicle you have, your ambitions for racing, and the particular rules of the track in your area, you'll likely have lots of different options available to you for races. You might want to enter a pro-style elimination race, which is probably the most common, or you might just want to get on the track and burn some rubber in time trials. As long as you've got a good vehicle with some muscle behind it, you'll be able to find something that's right for you at most tracks.    Elimination Races are basic bracketed elimination rounds, in which two cars in the same class will go head-to-head. The loser will be eliminated, and the winner will move on to the next round, until one car remains. To seed the field, practice runs and time trials usually precede the race.  Bracket Races are similar to Elimination Races, but with the inclusion of handicaps to allow for vehicles of different specs to compete against one another, making these races a test of skill, rather than muscle. Instead of straight-up time trials, cars complete "Dial In" runs, in which the goal is to come as close as possible to the estimated speed (how fast your car can possibly make a single run). The difference will be subtracted from each of your trials throughout the race.  Time Trials are available for any class of vehicle that passes safety inspection and pays the track fee. Usually, if you're not planning on running trials to qualify, you'll only be allowed to make runs on particular days, sometimes called "test and tune" nights. You can collect a time sheet with specific details about each of your runs, and keep track of your long-term progress. This is an excellent way to start and build your drag-racing skills.  After paying at the gate and registering, you'll next drive your car to the inspection area, where track officials will give your car a once-over, checking fluid levels, weight, and other specifications to make sure that your vehicle is safe to run on the track. If you pass the inspection, they'll usually slap a corresponding inspection sticker on your windshield, signifying that you've passed and that you can proceed to the staging area.   Most tracks require a minimum running weight to be met by every vehicle, with the driver in the car. Many serious racers will find the minimum weight for their vehicle class and get it down as low as possible to increase the horsepower and the efficiency of the engine., Before you pull up to the starting line and jam on the gas, you'll have to find out where you'll race in the field by qualifying for your starting position. Depending on the track rules and the vehicle class, you'll be held to different standards, but you'll start most elimination rounds by qualifying for your starting place with the best possible run you're capable of. Several measurements are taken for each race, including your reaction time, the total elapsed time of the run, and your speed.   Your reaction time will be measured right at the start of the race, and should be as short as possible, tracking the time between the green light and your vehicle leaving the starting line. Your elapsed time will be measured from the moment you've left the starting line to the moment you cross the finish line. Your top speed will be measured just as you pass the finish line, making it important that you power across it for the best result. There should be ample room to slow down.  In the staging area behind the track, you should pass through what is called the water box or the bleach box at most tracks, which is basically just a patch of the track that has been hosed down. This is where racers with track tires will do a burnout to heat up the tires and "burn off" any sediment or other gunk that's been built up.   If you don't want to burn out before racing, that's fine. Just drive around the water box and approach the starting line instead. Flat racing tires always need to be warmed up, but street tires with tread should generally not be. If you're worried about street build-up on street tires, you can do a peel out to clean them up, if you want.  On professional tracks, the starting line is somewhat complicated, because it's not usually marked on the ground and is monitored with lasers. Let the track officials guide you toward the general area, and then look to the "Christmas tree" (the stalk of colored lights in the center of the track) to find out when you're on the money.   At most tracks, a yellow light will engage when you're close (within 7 inches) of the starting line, and a second light will engage when you're on it. Watch the track official between the two lanes for more specific instructions. They're there to help.  Most trees usually about about seven lights, including the indicator lights when you're on the starting line. Depending on your class and the kind of race you're running, the tree will light differently to signal that start of the race.In some races, three large amber lights will flash simultaneously, followed by the green light in four-tenths of a second. In other races, the three bulbs will flash twice, followed five-tenths of a second later by the green light. Make sure you watch other racers start and find out what kind of light start will be used before you end up on the starting line.  In general, if you see the green light, you probably started too late. It takes some practice and skill to get a good start down, because it's very much about anticipating the green and leaving with it, rather than waiting until you see it. Experienced drivers are often very good at this, so don't get frustrated if it takes you several time trials and runs before you get the hang of it.   Before you start, maintain your RPMs at the optimum speed to jump into your desired gear (lots of dragsters will pop in second, for example). Keep track of the timing changes in the lights, anticipate the green, and hit the gas.  Drag racing isn't the time for taking it easy, it's the time for seeing what your machine is made of. If you've passed the safety inspection and know your vehicle inside and out, you should know what it's capable of and use this opportunity to open up the throttle and go all-out. Floor it, shifting up as you power through the track, and accelerating into the finish.While you're tearing down the strip, be very careful to stay in your lane. Don't look at the other car, if you're going head-to-head, pay attention to your own car and what you're doing. Crossing the center line, apart from being extremely dangerous, will usually earn you a disqualification.  Often, at tracks, there's a particular "track rules" etiquette regarding which lane has the right of way in head-to-head runs. Often, the common courtesy, however, is that the slower car will slow down more quickly, falling in line behind the faster car. You'll both pull off in line, then, and drive to the timing booth.  After running the race, you'll pass by the timing booth, where you'll receive a slip with your reaction time, your total elapsed time, and your top speed. At some tracks, this may also show large on a scoreboard-style screen, but often these are back closer to the starting line for spectators to see.  When you get wrapped up in all the grease and machismo floating around at the strip, it can be common to forget about the most essential part of drag racing: surviving it. Make sure that you're aware of everyone on the track, around it, and stay focused on completing the run with safety. If you feel unsure about racing, unconfident in your vehicle, or uncomfortable with the track conditions, pack it up for the day.   You need to always have your vehicle inspected before drag racing. Blowing out a tire going 120 mph (190 km/h) is extraordinarily dangerous, and turning out of a skid at those speeds can be deadly. Use extreme caution.  The Snell Memorial Foundation was founded by William "Pete" Snell, an amateur auto racer who died in a racing event in 1956. His then supposedly state-of-the-art helmet failed to protect from passing away, and a number of his fellow racers, colleagues and friends came together in an effort to improve the design of helmets along with their capabilities. They're now considered the standard in the field. If you're going to drag race, you need one.  The ideal time to shift is when the descending power curve for the lower gear crosses the ascending power curve for the higher gear. Most drag racers will use a tachometer to closely monitor the RPMs and feel for that sweet spot, just before the RPMs hit the red patch on the gauge.   Many drag racers will use a lighted tachometer, which will flash a light indicating the optimal time to shift. Great racers anticipate these lights, however, shifting perhaps 200 or 300 RPMs before the "ideal" time, to make the action slightly smoother. Drag racing in automatic transmission vehicles exists, but is less common. Manual transmission vehicles offer faster acceleration times if you can get the technique right. If you want to get into drag racing, practice your shifting in a manual transmission vehicle.  If you want to really grip the track, you need to get some racing tires for your vehicle. Without tread, heading up bald tires will allow you to grip the track and increase the efficiency of the engine.   Contrary to popular belief, keeping the tires a little low doesn't help improve your times as much as once believed. While it does increase the surface of the tires by a small degree, keeping the tires too low can cause the interior wall to wrinkle, having the opposite effect. Keep the tires inflated to the low end of the proper specs.  After several runs down the strip, you should start to notice some build up from other cars' rubber and exhaust developing. That's the sweet spot. Bare asphalt won't have the traction that this coating of rubber has. Stick to the groove and barrel down the track.	Choose between style and speed. Pick something that you'll enjoy working on. Start with a light frame with high aftermarket potential. Consider rebuilding the engine or installing a new engine. Upgrade the suspension with control arms and drag shocks. Install a power-adder if you want to run your car on the street. Keep a close eye out for overheating with modified muscle cars. Understand the different classes of drag vehicles. Find a closed-track racetrack with a drag strip in your area. Register your vehicle in the correct category. Pick the appropriate style of drag race for your vehicle. Pass a tech inspection at the closed-track drag strip. Complete your pre-race qualification runs. Warm up your tires in the water box. Approach the starting line from the staging area. Watch the Christmas Tree for the starting lights. Leave on green. Power through the finish. Follow the proper slow-down etiquette. Pick up your time slip from the timing booth. Always put safety first. Invest in a Snell-certified helmet. Shift at the correct times. Use bald racing tires inflated to the proper specs. Drive in the "groove" created by other racers' tire slicks.
You should hold your harmonica nestled in your left hand, with your thumb supporting the bottom of the instrument and your other fingers along the top. The harmonica should be oriented so that the numbers printed on its holes are facing upwards.   Take your hand and form an open C-shape with your fingers and thumb. Your harmonica should be positioned deeply into the C-shape, tucked into the area where your thumb joins your hand.; , You should not pucker your lips as you would for a kiss or play the harmonica with only the outer portion of your lips. The case of the harmonica will need to be in contact with the inner part of your mouth to give you proper control while playing. Your lips should touch the casing and the wood/plastic body should be inside your mouth.   For the best control and quality of tone, you should try to keep your jaw as relaxed as possible while playing. Your jaw should be slightly lowered when playing your harmonica. This will create more space in your mouth and give your playing a richer tone. While getting used to forming a proper mouth seal with your harmonica, it can be difficult holding the instrument in position while keeping your jaw relaxed. Take your time, and practice until this becomes second nature., Blocking is a harmonica technique that closes off other holes so you can play a single note. This is especially important for bending, as you can only bend a single note at a time on the harmonica. There are two different kinds of blocking:    Lip blocking is best for bending notes in blues and melody. Use your lips to block all other holes of your harmonica by narrowing the opening of your mouth to about the width of a pencil.  Tongue blocking closes off other notes that are open to your mouth by covering them with your tongue, leaving a single free hole to either side of your mouth. You won't need to narrow your mouth as much doing this as you would with lip blocking., When you play a note by exhaling it's called "blowing." Oppositely, playing a note by inhaling is called "drawing." For the best sound quality when playing, you shouldn't puff on your harmonica, but breathe through it with well supported breath.   You won't need to blast your harmonica with strong streams of air. You can get a full, rich sound from your harmonica with moderate amounts of sustained breathing. As you become more skillful at playing the harmonica, you may find that you can breathe somewhat through the instrument to reduce the amount of full breaths you take. This can help you sustain long melodic phrases without a break in the sound.	Hold your harmonica correctly. Form a seal with your harmonica and mouth. Practice blocking notes. Control your breathing.
, You'll use this to make a crow's nest. Just fold it around and tape it., Then cut a small square out of the side, but don't cut the last side.,, Fold it into a tiny square by folding it over again and again and again and again. Once you've got the thick square, snip two tiny rectangles into it. Be careful, you don't you may accidentally snip the ladder rungs apart. Unfold the ladder carefully. It should be a long ladder patterned thing. Tape one end of it to the bottom of the ship, and the other end to the crow's nest, just beneath the door.  If it floats, you're good! If it doesn't float, tape a sheet of aluminum foil or tinfoil to the bottom of your raft and a little bit up around the edges., Cut a circle and tape it onto the top of the straw. This is your steering wheel. Cut a tiny slit in the straw. Then, cut a piece of paper big enough for a table. Fold the straw back a little, exposing the slit. Put in the paper and let go of the straw.	Make an Egyptian Sailor (method above) with only one castle and no oars. Use a piece of paper and cut out a long rectangle. Cut a circle bigger than the bottom of the nest and tape it at the bottom.Tape it to the mast, the door should be facing outwards. Make a ladder up to the crow's nest:  Cut a long piece of paper long enough to reach from the bottom of your ship to the door of the crow's nest. Test it in water. Try an optional addition:  Use the mast technique from above to put in a small piece of straw at the castle-less front of the boat.
Your tires are only able to do one hundred percent of one thing, so if you attempt to brake and turn simultaneously, you could lose traction in your front tires resulting in understeer. You can avoid this issue by braking prior to the turn so you are less likely to lose grip.You are more likely to lock up your tires if you are turning and braking at the same time.  Understeer is more likely to occur when there are other elements limiting the amount of grip available to your tires. Situations like heavy rain, snowfall or ice can all limit the traction of your tires and increase the likelihood of understeer.When traction is limited due to road conditions, drive slower and carry less speed into turns. Follow posted speed limits and pay attention for signs indicating a change in road surface.  An easy way to avoid understeer situations is to follow the old racing rule, “slow in, fast out.” That means to approach corners slowly, then accelerate out of them. This method will prevent you from being taken by surprise by steeper turns than you expect.When driving in unfamiliar areas, approach corners slowly, then accelerate once you know you can handle them. Roll onto the accelerator slowly as you accelerate out to avoid causing understeer inside the corner.  If you come into a corner slowly and realize you’d like to go faster, you may be tempted to accelerate quickly through the remainder of the corner. Remember that your tires traction will be compromised if you ask them to accelerate and corner simultaneously.Add throttle gradually as you turn to maintain traction in the tires. Front wheel drive cars are more prone to understeer as your accelerate because you may get front wheel spin if you give it too much gas.	Brake prior to cornering. Travel at the appropriate speed for road conditions. Use the rule of thumb “slow in, fast out” when cornering. Avoid adding too much throttle as you turn.
This will provide you with the measurements needed for the fabric amounts. You will need three panels for each curtain (2 curtains in total), each panel measuring one third of the entire length.  Add 8cm/3 inches to the top of the top panel. This provides the heading. Add 16cm/6.5 inches to the bottom panel for the curtain's hem.; ,,,, Add the middle panel on top of it. Face the right sides together, aligning the raw edges. Pin the two panels together, then stitch the panels together at one edge, allowing a 1/5cm / 5/8 inch seam allowance. If the fabric has patterns, stripes or checks, match as best you can before sewing. Press open the seam.,, Cut to the width of the panels. Pin over the seams that join the curtain panels. Stitch in place, sewing both edges of the braid. This will cover the seams and make the curtain appear more streamlined., Press in a 6cm/ 2.5 inch hem. For the base, press in an 8cm/ 3 inch hem. Press in the angled miters. Pin and sew the hems in place., Press in a 2cm/ 3/4 inch around the side edge and a 2cm/ 3/4 inch base hem. Pin and miter the corners, then stitch all in place., Place the lining onto the back of the curtain, matching up the corners with the curtain's corners. Pin in place and slip stitch onto the curtain fabric. However, do not stitch the base edge, as this helps the curtain to hang better., The ties should be placed one every 25cm/10 inches across the top of the curtain, so measure to determine how many you'll need. To make a tie:  Cut a strip of fabric measuring 6 x 50cm/ 2.5 x 20 inches for each tie. Knot the ends of each strip.  Mark a line 8cm/3 inches below the top raw edge across the top of the curtain. Use an invisible marker that fades or tailor's chalk., Pin each tie halfway sitting on the line you just drew. Stitch all the way along the row, capturing each tie halfway on the line (this is easiest done with machine stitching)., Pin and slip stitch the fold in place., Stitch using slip stitch to close.,, The tie top curtains are ready to tie onto the curtain pole using the top ties. Simply tie into bows around the curtain rod all the way along the length of the rod. Leave enough room to push the curtains back and forth with ease.	Measure the window.In terms of width, both curtains together must cover width of the curtain pole plus 12cm/5 inches for side hems.If using lining, make it 4cm/1 3/4 inches smaller than the finished curtain.Cut out the fabric according to the measurements taken above. Put the top panel down on a flat surface.Attach the bottom panel to the middle panel in the same manner. Cut two lengths of braid or ribbon. Press in a hem at each side of the curtain. If adding lining, cut out according to the above measurements. Put the curtain on a flat surface, right side facing down. Make the ties. Turn the curtain over to face right side up on the flat surface. Begin at the top corner of the curtain, then measure 25cm/10 inches across for each tie. Press in a double 4cm/1 3/4 inch fold to the wrong side of the top edge of the curtains. At each of the top corners of the curtain, close the open ends.Press the completed curtains. Done.
Consider this when booking.  The travel time is cut in half from 25 to 13, including travel time to Shenzhen.  It'll also be much cheaper.  Train travel is very important to many Chinese, and the government is frequently delegating money to expanding services. However, until a fast train link to Hong Kong is developed, try searching for trains that leave from both Hong Kong (香港) and Shenzhen (深圳)	Across the border in Shenzhen, there are direct fast trains (D, C) to various destinations in China. If going to Beijing, take the G72 or the G80 from Shenzhen. If going to Shanghai, you can take a fast 'D' train that takes 10 hours as opposed to 18. New routes are being added all the time.
Here the wire is wrapped around a book 90 times. Then wire cutters were used to cut all of the pieces at once.; , Bend it in half as you smooth out the kinks in the wire, using the cloth. You can smooth the wire with your bare hands but it's easier on your fingers if you use a cloth.	Cut 90 pieces of wire that are 18" (43cm) long. Remove one wire from the bundle.
Creating a scalloped edge for a garment is quite easy, but you will need to have some special materials handy before you get started. You will need:   Fabric. Make sure that you use something that will hold its shape, such as cotton, wool, and linen.Round item to use as a guide for creating scallops, such as a bowl, cup, or coin. You can make the scallops as small or as large as you like. Freezer paper (optional). You can use freezer paper to create a template for you scallops and then sew around this template instead of drawing the scallops directly on the fabric.Pencil or fabric chalk. Scissors. Measuring tape and ruler. Sewing machine.; , If you are adding a scalloped edge to a finished garment, such as for the hem of a skirt, then you will need to know how long to make the edge. Measure the edge of garment or fabric piece that you want to add a scalloped edge onto and write down this measurement., Before you trace your scallops into your actual garment, it is helpful to practice the design on a piece of paper first. This can help you to find the ideal size for your piece. Start by drawing a straight line on the paper, and then place of the round objects on the line so that only about half or less than half of it is on one side of the line. Trace around the rounded edge to create your first scallop.After you make the first scallop, slide the round object over so that the edge is lined up with the edge of the first scallop you traced onto the paper. Then, draw another scallop in the same way. Continue to create scallops in this way until you are happy with the design. If you are planning to make a template using freezer paper to guide your work, then trace your scalloped design onto the freezer paper. Then, cut along the curved edges and cut the paper so that there is about a two inch strip between the deepest curve of the scallops and the other edge of the paper.  Make sure that the right sides (printed sides) of the fabric are facing inwards and that the edges are even.If you are using a fabric that does not fray easily, then you may be able to simply sew along the edge of one piece of fabric and then trim the fabric up to the seam., If you plan to draw directly on your fabric, then start by creating a line that is far enough away from the edge of your fabric to accommodate the size of your scallops. Then, trace the scallops the same way that you did while experimenting on paper.If you are using a template made from freezer paper, then you can simply pin the template onto your fabric.  Whether you traced your scallops directly onto the fabric or you are using a template, you will need to sew along the curved edges. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch along the curved edges.If you are using a template, be careful not to sew over the paper. Try to sew as close to the paper as possible without letting the needle pierce the paper.  After you have created the scalloped seam, you can trim off the excess fabric to reveal the scalloped shapes in your fabric. Trim the fabric along the curved edges, but allow about ¼” to ½” seam allowance.If you only used one piece of fabric, then you can trim right up to the edge of the seam and your scalloped edge is finished.  To ensure that the scallops lay nicely after you turn the fabric inside out, cut out some small triangles in the seam allowance fabric along the edges of the scallops. Cut out a triangle of fabric about every ¼” to ½” and be careful not to cut into the seam stitch., To finish the scalloped edge, turn the fabric inside out so that the seam and triangle notches you cut into the fabric will be hidden. Push your fingers into the inside of each scallop to ensure that they all have a nice curved shape.If the scallops look lumpy, then you may need to iron out the edges to make them lay flat.	Gather your materials. Determine how long your edging will need to be. Experiment on paper first. Place two pieces of fabric together. Trace scallops onto your fabric. Sew along the curved edges. Trim the fabric along the curved edges. Cut triangles into edges to remove bulk. Turn the fabric inside out.
Cut the strips 1.2cm (1/2 inch) in width. The length is up to you but be aware that the longer the strip is, the larger the flower size becomes.  Choose colors that match well.  Roll up the strips from one end, to create a firm spiral., Glue down the bottom strip, then glue the outside strip. Trim off any excess felt., This gives the flower a more dimensional aspect., Glue one or two to the base of the flower to complete it., The flower is now done. Make as many as needed for your craft project.	Cut two strips of felt from two different colors. Place one strip on top of the other strip. Glue the ends. Gently push the middle out a little way. Cut out small leaf shapes from green felt. Complete.
Determine how many pedals you want to include as this will determine how much wood or other material you will need.; , Space the pedals apart at a width allowing enough room to be connected properly, and measure accordingly using your eye or a measuring device.  Most pedal boards are made up of plastic or wood with rubber feet, it may be best to make something similar or you can create a shape or size of your own., Buy some industrial self-adhesive strength Velcro the kind you could use to mount things on walls and stick it to the back of each pedal and stick it down. Doing this will make sure your pedals will stay put but be aware that Velcro adhesive may take the sticker off the back of a pedal or any loose markings.	Size up. Measure. Build. Detail.
Simple benches with straight edges rather than curved would work best for this. You can also use a long, low, narrow table instead, as long as you can sit comfortably on it. Avoid anything slatted or cushioned.; , Even though you will be covering it, you still want to clean it. Any dirt and grim may prevent the adhesive from sticking properly. Wipe the entire bench down with a damp cloth first, then dry it with a clean towel.  This will remove any residual oils. Don't worry if the rubbing alcohol removes some of the original paint. You will be covering the bench with cork, so it won't be noticeable in the end.  You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add a fresh look to your bench. Remove the legs first, if possible, then paint them using spray paint. Set them aside so that they can dry while you complete the rest of the bench.If you can't remove the legs, it might be easier to paint them with a paintbrush instead.  You won't be covering the underside of the bench with cork, but it may still be visible from certain angles. You can paint it any color you want, but it might look better if you match it to the legs. A dark, neutral color, such as black, brown, or espresso would also work well. Let the paint dry before moving on.   You can use spray paint or regular liquid paint.  Place the bench down on top of the cork, then trace around it with a pen. Flip the bench onto its side, and trace it again, Continue tracing around the other three side panels as well. You don't need to trace a panel for the bottom of the bench.   I you cork has a front and back, trace onto the back of the cork. If your bench is too heavy to move around, measure the top and side panels first, then draw rectangles on the cork based on those measurements., Set the cork down onto a cutting mat. Then, use a craft blade and a metal ruler to cut the rectangles out. The metal ruler will help make your cuts nice, crisp, and even. It will also help keep you from accidentally nicking the rectangles., Wait about 30 seconds for the glue to get tacky. Don't do the other cork panels and bench sides just yet., If the cork panel is peeling away, flip the bench over so that the cork is against the floor and the bench is weighing it down. Let it sit like that until the glue sets before moving on. This should only take a few minutes.  Again, work one panel at a time. If you do everything all at once, the glue will start to dry and lose its tack.  How long the glue takes to dry depends on the type of glue you used, so be sure to check the label on the can. This should only take 30 to 60 minutes for most brands.  Place a stencil over one of the side edges of your bench. Dab acrylic paint over the stencil, working your way from outside-in. Peel the stencil away, then do the other sides. Let the paint dry completely before moving on.If the stencil is not self-adhesive, secure it with painter's tape first. You can paint the top panel, if you want to, but keep in mind that the paint will wear away faster.  You don't have to do this, but it will make the cork easier to clean. Simply apply a clear, acrylic sealer over the bench, then let it dry. You may need to apply another coat or two; be sure to let each coat dry fully before applying the next. For best results, choose a matte or satin sealer; a glossy sealer may not look good with a cork finish.   If you painted your bench (including the legs or underside), then this is a must.  Once you have the legs back on, your bench is ready to use!	Choose a plain bench that you want to modify. Clean the bench with a damp cloth. Wipe the bench down a final time with rubbing alcohol. Paint the legs, if desired. Paint the underside of the bench, if desired. Trace the top and sides of the bench seat onto a sheet of thin cork. Cut the panels out. Coat one of the cork panels and matching bench side with spray adhesive. Press the cork panel onto the matching bench side. Continue gluing the rest of the cork panels to the bench. Let the glue set. Consider adding stencils to the side edges. Seal the bench with acrylic sealer. Screw the legs back on if you removed them earlier.
Depending on the fuel used for the heater you must first shut off the gas supply to the unit. If it is electric you must shut off the power. This is critical. If you do not shut off the electricity, you will burn out the heating elements in a few seconds. If the heater is oil fired, shut off the motor switch.; , You won't want water shooting out all over the place.  If you do not have the space (at least three (3) feet) you will have to drain the tank. Loosen the anode rod before the next step, it will make life easier.  Tilt it enough to allow you to remove the old anode rod. Before going to this trouble, verify that your anode rod is not articulated. If it is, you may skip emptying the tank and disconnecting the water connections In the event you do have to drain the tank, disconnect the water and tilt the tank to remove the old rod, consider replacing it with an articulated anode rod. This will make future maintenance much easier.  Verify that you have no leaks.	Shut down supply. Shut off the water supply. If you have sufficient clearance between the top of the heater and the ceiling you may unscrew the the old anode rod from the heater, and remove it. Disconnect the pipes leading in and out of the tank. After you have replaced the rod and before turning the power on, turn the water back on.
Areas that contain likely deposits of lode gold have been explored thoroughly. The inexperienced prospector with minimal capital has little chance of discovering a lode worth developing.    Water enters the ground through cracks and is drawn into hotter regions that are heated by magma or molten rock. The heated water dissolves many of the rocks around it. When the magma reaches cooler and shallower rocks, the metals in the hot water show up as veins or as larger and flatter ore bodies.  As magma moves up through the Earth’s crust, cooling and solidifying, the gold-bearing solutions from the magma are immediately precipitated in granitic rock.    Rocks are forced under continents in mountain building and experience high pressures and temperatures. Chemical reactions rearrange the rock’s mineral constituents. Metamorphism causes precious metals to be expelled from the rocks and to move to the surface.	Understand that the odds are against you. Look in volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Look in granitic rocks. Look for gold in metamorphic rocks.
They typically feature exotic locations where the protagonist has been stranded or has traveled to. These said exotic locations are usually islands, jungles, or some kind of frozen wasteland.  These typically feature a mixture of witty banter, numerous sword fights, a flamboyant protagonist trying to save a damsel, and a Western European setting. Some well known swashbuckler films are the Zorro franchise and The Princess Bride.  This is a survival movie. Deliverance, The Revenant, and 127 Hours fall into this category.  If yes, it's most likely a pirate film. Movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Treasure Island belong to this sub-genre.  This is a disaster film. Movies like The Towering Inferno and Cloverfield are disaster films.	Identify adventure movies. Identify swashbuckler films. Notice if the protagonist has been stranded in the wilderness, typically by him/herself. Notice if the movie centers around pirates. Notice if the film centers around a huge natural disaster with much collateral damage.
Allow roughly 3 times the amount of length that you need for the finished product, as this allows room for not only the head of the tassel but also length of the trailers.; , Many designs call for a minimum of 9, but use whatever number will work well in your application  , Tie a knot at 1 end of the upholstery thread.  The starter bead is normally a larger bead in the design that serves as the stopper for the rest of the beads in the strand.  Make the design as eclectic or as simple as you like. Beads can vary in size and shape, depending on the look you wish to achieve.  Cut off the knot at the end of the upholstery thread, and attach 1 end of the trailer. Gently pull the trailer through the beads until the top of the trailer emerges from the last bead in the series. Make sure the trailer is taut, with no extra length along the strand. Promptly tie 1 end of the trailer to keep the beads in position. , Knot the individual trailers together, positioning the knot as close to the beads as possible, but far away enough that the trailers can hang freely. Loop the trailer, and tie in place to create a means of hanging the tassel.  This helps to hide the knot and give the tassel a finished look. If desired, use a small drop of hot glue to hold the bead in position.	Measure the desired length of the tassel. Determine the number of trailers you want. Cut a length of upholstery thread that coincides with the length of the desired number of trailers, and insert the end of the thread through the eye of a beading needle. Use what is known as a starter or master bead at the bottom of the thread. Follow with a succession of beads to create the length of beads desired for each trailer on the tassel. Slide the succession of beads onto the trailer. Repeat the process for each of the trailers desired for the tassel until the desired number of trailers are complete.  , Combine the trailers to form the head of the tassel. Thread a larger bead over the knot of the loop and the knot. Finished.
Buy pinstripes if you can. You can choose a different color too, but make sure they look old and strange. The Mad Hatter's clothes were antiquated and interesting - that is part of the appeal. The more out of date your clothes look the better. Just don’t buy anything that you aren’t willing to damage.  If you couldn’t find a pair of pants with pinstripes, use thin painter's tape to make your own pinstripes. Tear off long pieces of tape that run down the length of the pants or jacket and tape them on. This isn’t a permanent solution but for a one night event it will do the trick.  If you bought purple pants and jacket, use a green spray-paint. Try to stick to dark colors. Black and white probably aren’t the best bet for this costume. You want the spray paint to look slightly psychedelic and otherworldly. You can buy fabric spray paint online or at your local crafts store.   Spray circles and color in larger portions of the jacket and pants using the fabric spray paint. This will give the impression that your clothing isn’t sure what color it is. The spray paint is a major addition to your costume.	Buy a pair of old green or purple pants and jacket. Make your pinstripes. Spray fabric spray paint in random areas on your clothing.
Cut out a rectangle of paper that is 12 inches long and about half as wide as the shirt (or your shoulders). Use a ruler to make sure all of the edges are straight.For example, if your shoulder width is 18 inches, the paper should be 12 inches by 9 inches. Tissue paper is good to use for this because it usually comes in large sheets and it is easy to fold and cut. Be gentle with it so you don’t rip it.; , Fold it so that the 12 inch side is still 12 inches and the other side is now half as wide. Make sure the corners are lined up straight so the fold is perfectly symmetrical., Make a dot ½ inch from the uncreased edge of the short side. Make another dot 4 inches from the top the creased edge of the paper. Connect these two dots with a curved line., Using sharp scissors, carefully cut along the line you have drawn. This will create the section that will go around your neck. You can throw away the small portion that you have cut out. Unfold the paper pattern before you to trace it on the fabric., Lay the fabric flat on a table or counter and lay the pattern on top of the fabric. Make sure both are smooth. Using a pencil or pen, trace around the entire pattern.   An old cotton t-shirt that you don’t mind cutting up would be ideal for making a collar. Use a part of the shirt that has no pictures or stitching on it.  Using sharp scissors, slowly cut out the pattern. Try to make all of the lines as straight as possible. You don’t want the collar to appear crooked or wavy. You could also lay the fabric on a large piece of cardboard and cut it out with a box cutter., Once you choose a shirt, carefully sew the collar to the shirt. Hang the flaps over the front of the shirt, with the square part of the collar hanging down the back. For a more temporary option, you can use safety pins to attach the collar. You can also sew a ribbon around the outer edge for added flare.  You have some freedom with this, as there’s a variety of ways sailors can look. Your basic option is a long-sleeve, white v-neck shirt. You could also go with a dark blue look. A baggy white shirt that has a wide neck that ties closed is also an option. This look is a little more pirate than sailor, but there’s a close connection.   A short sleeve shirt is also an option if you want a more casual or less hot costume. You can consider sewing two blue stripes around the cuff of the shirt. Depending on what kind of sailor look you want, a white shirt with blue or black horizontal stripes is also a good choice. You can draw the stripes on with a marker if you don’t have a striped shirt. The stripes should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick and 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart.  Your sailor outfit can either be solid white, solid blue, or can be half and half. So choose your pants according to how you want the overall outfit to look. Your best bet is probably slacks. You can iron them to give them a sharp crease in the front. You could also go with looser cotton pants that don’t have a crease.  You have some flexibility in shoes. You probably want either white or black, depending on the colors of your shirt and pants. Loafers or boat shoes are a good option, but you could also wear shiny black lace up shoes or even military style boots.If you have multiple pairs of shoes already, or you want to buy some anyway, try out different options and decide which style you like best.  Choose a thin scarf that is approximately 2 feet long. Wrap it around the back of your neck, going under the collar, and tie it loosely in front. The knot should hang somewhere around your sternum.   A basic overhand knot like you would tie in a rope is sufficient, but you can make it look fancier if you want. If your outfit is all white, a royal blue or navy blue scarf is a good accent. If you chose a darker outfit, consider a white scarf.  With a flexible measuring tape, like one you would find in sewing kit, take a measurement around your head. If you don’t have this kind of measuring tape, a piece of string will work. Write down the number of inches your head measured. If you used string, make a mark on it noting the measurement.  You’ll use this measurement to create the band of the cap. If you want to make sure the cap isn’t too tight, you may want to add a little extra length.  Cut the strip to your head measurement length and about 2 inches wide. After you cut it, circle it around your head to make sure it’s the right size. Trim it down or cut a longer strip as needed. Staple the strip into a circle.  A cereal box is a good option for this step.  With the cardboard circle sitting on the table, or counter, place a coffee filter inside it with open end up. Place 4 to 5 staples around the edge securing the filter to the cardboard circle., This wrap should extend about ½ inch past each side of the cardboard. Fold the extra down over the rim of the cardboard on the top and bottom. Then glue it in place to make sure it stays folded.  You want the hat to appear all white, so try to make sure the cardboard is not visible. To do this, either use thick enough paper or fabric, or considering making it double thick with two layers. If you used a white shirt to cut out the collar, you could use more fabric from this same shirt.  The portion of the coffee filter that you stapled to the cardboard will be the top of the hat so the staples don’t rest on your head. Allow all of the glue to dry before placing the hat on your head.	Use a piece of paper to make a pattern. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Draw a curved line from the short side to the folded side. Cut out the curved section. Trace the pattern onto a piece of fabric. Cut the fabric along the traced pattern. Attach the collar to the shirt. Select a shirt. Pick your pants. Choose your shoes. Tie a scarf around your neck. Measure your head’s circumference. Cut a strip of thin, flexible cardboard. Attach a coffee filter to the cardboard circle. Wrap white fabric or paper around the cardboard. Push the coffee filter through so the bottom becomes the top.
Ska has a very different feel from anarcho-punk, and your mood might dictate which sub-genre you want on your playlist. Remember punk is a very large genre that encompasses a lot of ground, so learn about the most popular sub-genres, including their history, their most well-known artists, what subjects or issues they deal with, and the general character of their sounds. Decide which sub-genres to include in order to achieve your overall sound.; , This is one of the more common sub-genres and is most often identifiable by its happier tone, even though the song might be about sad things such as family trouble, relationship breakdowns, or day-to-day struggles for middle-class youth. Note this is a different type of angst than those in other sub-genres of punk. Examples of Pop Punk include Blink-182, The Offspring and Green Day.  This sub-genre is very close to the original punk genre and is characterized by its often nihilistic attitude. Members of anarcho-punk bands will often be anarchists and will sing about trying to revolt against capitalism or overthrow the corruption that is apparent with the current government structure. This genre is not for the lighthearted and as such is probably not good for a party mix. Examples of anarcho-punk are The Sex Pistols, Discharge, or Propagandhi.  This is a step up in terms of aggression. Rather than dealing with issues such as politics, hardcore often tends to deal with more violent topics, such as war, racism on the streets, anti-police mentality, and the like. It is defined by its often extremely abrasive sound, and it mixes in lots of breakdowns with high distortion. Examples of Hardcore include Minor Threat, Bad Brains, The Dead Kennedys or Agnostic Front.  Skate punk is another well known genre that had a lot of interest during the late 90's. It is often extremely fast, with fast-paced drums and stories of running from cops, skating till the death, and other anecdotes common amongst skaters. It often has some extremely short songs, even under the 30 second mark. A few good examples of skate-punk are NOFX, Suicidal Tendencies, Strung Out, and Pennywise.  These two sub-genres revolve around the issues faced by the working class, with the expressed intention of Oi! being to unite skinheads, other punks and the working class. Most of the lyrical content revolves around the conflicts and struggle of the day-to-day life in the working class, and are often very nihilistic or jaded. Some street-punk bands are The Casualties, The Distillers and Street Dogs. A few Oi! bands are The Discocks, Blitz, Anti-Heros and some of the early Dropkick Murphys.  There are so many genres under the punk umbrella, including some extremely odd ones, like electropunk or harsh noise, so make sure to explore. Punk is a mixed bag so feel free to experiment to your taste, and don't feel the pressure to like all of it. Pick and choose freely what you want and make your own inferences about what styles suit you and your outlook.  Now that you've chosen an overall tone for your playlist, you need to find material for it. There are a wide variety of websites that can help you find material to add into a playlist and are easily accessible. Don't worry yet about choosing the perfect mix of songs; instead, focus on finding artists and songs that fit the overall tone of your playlist. Come up with a list of possibilities, and you can later narrow it down from there.  Use websites like last.fm, which allows people to tag music and as such has an extremely large variety of bands under each genre tag. Simply use the search function to search for the punk genre that you are looking for and you'll have a wide variety of bands to check out at your finger tips. Unfortunately due to copyright issues, not a lot of music is hosted on the website.  YouTube is a great resource in this regard because it can allow you to find a lot of material that people have uploaded for you to stream for free regardless of your location. Some larger conglomerates, such as Vevo, may not allow you to stream music from certain artists in odd locations. At this time, there is no known way around this, so make sure to not just narrow your searching to an artist's official channel.  Spotify is another great location to search for music, and the even better side of it is that it even gives a tiny bit of revenue to the artist themselves. This may definitely help a local struggling punk band so it's a really good way to aid groups that are struggling to find their footing in the chaotic world of music.  Genius is a program within the iTunes framework which identifies music that is listed similarly on the iTunes Store. Whilst in principle, it is quite good, the limitations of the iTunes Store genre system leads to genre overlap, which is a bit irritating if you're trying to find one specific style.  Now that you've found a variety of artists, you can decide on what you want in the playlist. Consider questions like "Do I want whole albums?", "Do I only want popular singles?", and "Do I want a consistent sound?" This will help you set parameters when beginning to construct your playlist, and you can use these parameters to narrow down large list of artists and songs you found earlier.  Take music from the bands that you found previously, or choose other songs. Remember that a coherent playlist keeps a similar feel, so think about this when choosing your songs. This means that you could add certain pop-punk songs in with skate-punk songs because they have a similar energy. This will also make your playlist feel a lot more fulfilling, or consistent, as opposed to a mismatched hodgepodge of jumping tempos and levels of aggression.  Once you've chosen your songs, arrange them in order. You can do a lot of things with the way you order your playlist: use it to tell a story by following songs with others that flow naturally, emotionally or literally, from the first. Use it to evoke certain emotional responses in the listener or create a particular atmosphere. Intersperse a sequence of songs with one tone with one or two of another - for instance, one slow, melancholy song in the middle of several happy, upbeat songs - to draw out certain emotions or feelings or create a stronger mood.	First, consider what type of punk you're in the mood for. Consider pop-punk. Decide whether to include anarcho-punk. Consider Hardcore-punk or Hardcore. Think about skate-punk. Debate over whether to use Street Punk or Oi!. Dive into other sub-genres. Gather your raw material. Look for music on dedicated music sites. Use YouTube to find music. Find new music on Spotify. Using the Genius application through iTunes. Start constructing your playlist. Choose your songs. Order your playlist.
If you have decided that you are not okay with him paying, and you have talked about it, then the first step is to start changing the behavior. The next time you are out, offer to pay the bill. He may be paying all the time because you haven't offered to pay.Since you two have talked about it and how you feel about it, there shouldn't be any arguments. Try being lighthearted about it, keeping your tone bright and cheery.   ”Nope! My turn!” ”Hey, you've covered like the last 10 meals. I'm paying tonight.” If he takes out his wallet, ”Uh-uh, put it away mister. Tonight is on me.”  , It doesn't need to be a big deal; just let him know that you'd like to pay for yourself once in a while, starting with this bill.   An alternate way is to split the bill by items. Instead of splitting in half or for what you have ordered make an agreement to split up by parts. For example, if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert. If you are going to the movies, he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn.  You can also take turns with who pays for what dates. This works well with friends, too. If he pays for dinner one night, the next time you go out, you pay. Then the next date you have he pays, and so on, back and forth. This is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes.  If you are uncomfortable with him paying for everything, but you can't come to an agreement about it, then just plan for dates that are very inexpensive or free.There are tons of fun, low key things you can do that are cost effective.This way, you still get to date and have fun, without the stress of figuring out who is going to pay or worrying about getting into an argument about it.   For example, you and your boyfriend could go hiking or biking at a local park, take a trip to the beach, go to a free outdoor concert in your community, or stay in for a movie night.	Offer to pay. Split the bill down the middle.Another way to change it up is to offer to split the bill in half or to “go dutch” (each person paying for what they ordered) with the bill. Pay for alternate dates. Go on inexpensive or free dates.

If you don’t have yarn available, you can use any thick cotton string. At the location of where you would like the bottle to break, wrap a piece of yarn around the bottle 3-5 times. Tie the ends together and cut off any excess string.  Slide the yarn off the end of the bottle, and place it in a small dish or lid. Pour a bit of nail polish remover or straight-up acetone over the yarn until it is completely soaked. You can pour the excess acetone back into the bottle afterwards.  Take the yarn and replace it back on the bottle in the exact location you want it to break. Try to make sure that the loops of yarn are placed close together and are tight so that you get a level, clean break.  Use a match or a lighter to catch the yarn (on the bottle) on fire. Rotate the bottle slowly so that the yarn burns at a consistent speed around the entire bottle.  Have your sink or a pot filled with cold water - you can add ice as well if you would like. Wait until the fire on the yarn has burnt out, and then stick the end of the bottle with the yarn directly into the water. The bottle should break cleanly off where the yarn was wrapped around it.  Use a rough sandpaper to smooth down the jagged edges on the broken section of the bottle. When you have removed any sharp corners, switch to a fine grit sandpaper to give the bottle a smooth, soft finish. You’re done!	Wrap your yarn. Soak the yarn in acetone. Wrap the bottle again. Light the yarn on fire. Dunk the bottle in cold water. Sand the edges.
The amount of wax that you’ll need for the candles depends on the size of the jars you’re using and how many candles you plan to make. For four 8-ounce (227 g) candles, you’ll need approximately 6 cups (1419 g) of wax flakes.You can use whatever type of wax you like for the candles, but soy wax tends to absorb fragrance better than beeswax or other waxes.; , Once you’ve measured out the necessary wax for the candles, place the flakes in a medium size pot on the stove. Turn the burner to medium-low, and allow the wax to melt completely, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.Wax can ignite fairly easily, so watch the pot closely as the wax melts. Be sure to stir the wax with a wooden spoon or chop stick, while it’s heating to break up clumps and ensure that it melts evenly. If you find that it’s taking longer than 5 minutes or so for the wax to melt, turn the heat up to medium.  After the wax has melted completely, remove the pan from the burner. The wax will be too hot to scent right away, so allow it to cool for 2 to 3 minutes.The wax will cool more quickly if you transfer it from the pan to a cool bowl or other container.  While you’re waiting for the wax to cool, it’s a good idea to get the wicks ready in the jars. Place a small dab of glue from a hot glue gun on the bottom of the wick, and drop it down into the center of the jar. Allow the glue to set for several minutes before pouring the hot wax into the jar.If you don’t have a hot glue gun, you can also dab the bottom of the wicks with a small amount of melted wax, drop it down into the jar, and allow it to set for several minutes. Wax usually isn’t as secure as hot glue, though, because it may melt again when you pour the hot wax in.  While securing the wick to the bottom of the jar helps keep it in place, the length of the wick may fall into the hot wax when you pour it into the container. To keep that from happening, tape the end of the wick to a chopstick or pen. When the wick is taped to it, rest the chopstick or pen across the top of the jar., Once the wax has cooled for a couple of minutes, it’s time to add essential oil(s) to it to create an aromatherapy effect. The amount of essential oil depends on how potent the oil(s) you’re using are and how strongly scented you want your candles to be, but 80 to 100 drops is a  good number to start with. Stir the oil(s) into the wax well to ensure that it’s well combined.If you want extremely fragrant candles, you may want to add more than 100 drops. Experiment to see what the right amount is. You can use a single oil or mix two or more types of essential oils to create custom scents for your candles. You can also purchase fragrance oils designed specifically for making candles. They come in a wide variety of scents, including specialty fragrances, such as Christmas Cookie or Fresh Cut Grass.  The hot wax can sometimes splash up the sides of the jar when you pour it in. To avoid a mess, place a small funnel in jar, and pour the wax through it into the jar. Fill each jar in the same way.Depending on the size of the jars and how much you fill them, you may have some wax left over. To dispose of it, wait for it to solidify and then scrape it out of the pot or bowl. Never pour hot wax down the sink -- you’ll wind up clogging your pipes.  Once all of the jars are filled with wax, you have to wait for the wax to cool completely before you can light the candles. As the wax cools, it will solidify, which should take approximately 1 hour.You can tell that the candles are finished cooling when the wax becomes fully opaque.  When the candles are completely cool, remove the end of the wick from the chop stick or pen and use a pair of scissors to trim it to your desired length. In most cases, a ½-inch (1.27-cm) wick is sufficient. Light the candle and enjoy the scent that you’ve created.In addition to making candles for yourself, these homemade aromatherapy candles make ideal handmade gifts. You can customize the scent for each recipient for a lovely, personalized present.	Measure out the wax flakes. Place the wax in a pot and melt on the stove. Allow it the wax to cool briefly. Secure the wicks to the bottom of the jar. Keep the wicks in place with a chopstick or pen. Mix the essential oil(s) of your choice into the wax. Funnel the wax into the jars. Allow the candles to solidify. Trim the wicks and enjoy the candles.
A fluke or Danforth anchor relies less on its weight than on its design, which consists of two flat, pointed flukes extending at a 30º angle from the anchor rod. This is one of the more popular designs on the market, and in soft mud or hard sand, has more staying power by weight than any other type.However, its broad-fluked design may prevent it from reaching bottom in a strong current, and like most anchors, it will have trouble catching on rocks and other hard bottoms.   Aluminum variations of the Danforth design, such as the Fortress, have excellent holding power. Some of these also have adjustable flukes, which can be made broader when anchoring in soft mud.A large aluminum fluke anchor may make a good storm anchor.; , The plow anchor is named for the plow-shaped wedge attached by a swivel to the shaft. It is effective in soft bottoms, and somewhat better in grass than other lightweight anchors.These tend to be heavier than fluke anchors of the same size, and thus will set more easily (though with somewhat less holding power) than fluke anchors.The ability of the shaft to swivel in the direction it is pulled without yanking the main anchor makes the plow anchor less likely to unfasten when the boat is pulled a different direction.   Plow anchors have no protruding flukes or pieces that the anchor line or chain can catch on. However, unless you have a bow roller, plow anchors can be difficult to store., Mushroom anchors look like a disc or dish at the base of the anchor shaft. They don't have much holding power, but are a good choice for small boats that make short stops in areas with soft ground. If your boat is small enough for the size of mushroom anchor you choose, it may be your best bet for heavily weeded areas. If poking a hole in your vessel is a concern, mushroom anchors have no sharp edges and are less likely to damage thin hulled boats such as composite canoes, kayaks and inflatables.Many electric anchors lowered by the push of a button are mushroom anchors.  Many more types of anchor exist, and no single anchor is useful for every purpose. Grapnel, navy, or Herreshoff anchors are useful for anchoring small boats to rocky bottoms.Less common bottoms may require specialized anchors for best results, such as a claw anchor in gravel., Depending on what you use your boat for, you'll probably want several anchors of different sizes. Your main anchor is useful for extending fishing spots and most other purposes. An anchor one or two sizes smaller that's easy to deploy and pull up is good for lunch stops and other short breaks. A storm anchor one or two sizes larger should be kept around to deploy during rough weather or for overnight stops. In addition, it's always good to have at least one heavy backup in case you lose an anchor, or for situations where it's wise to use two anchors.   You should always follow the recommendations of your boat's manufacturer when picking anchor size. However, a rough chart can be found halfway down this page. Purchase a larger anchor than specified if you have an unusual amount of weight on your boat. When in doubt, purchase a larger anchor. Physical size is a more important indicator than weight, although both are relevant., Anchors are important for your safety, and you should buy the best anchors you can afford. Inspect each anchor for rust, uneven or breaking welding lines, and other inconsistencies in the metal before purchasing.  You may have a bow roller mounted on your boat where you can store and attach your anchor, but be aware that each roller is only suitable for specific types of anchors. Otherwise, make sure you have strong, sturdy deck cleats to tie the anchor rope onto., The chain, rope, or combination of these that attaches the anchor to your boat is called an anchor rode. Nylon's elasticity allows it to respond well to sudden wind and current changes, and a high quality rope is sufficiently strong to use as a rode. It is also easy to manipulate and relatively cheap, although you should not skimp on quality.   Three stranded nylon rope is most resistant to tears and thus best suited for water bottom purposes, but it will become difficult to handle and need to be replaced after it is stiff with salt. Choose medium lay three stranded rope, referring to the number of twists in the strands, as it will come apart less easily.Braided nylon rope is stronger and easier to work with, but not a great option for frequent anchor use, as it snags or tears from objects on the bottom., Chain is more expensive and takes more effort to use, but won't be fouled by strong currents and helps the anchor drop to the bottom quickly. Try to find anchor chain with high quality of manufacture and consistent galvanization, indicated by a uniform appearance. Good choices for chain types to use in anchor applications include BBB, Hi-test chain, and proof coil.Make sure the chain's links fit on your boat's windlass, which stores the chain and releases it as you drop the anchor.   Proof coil chain has a "G 3" imprinted on each link. BBB chain is a strong material with small links suitable for small windlasses. It is preferred by people who use all-chain anchor ropes rather than a mix of rope and chain. Hi-test chain is strong but light. Use it instead of the others if you'd like to reduce weight. Anchor chain made by North American companies is a more consistent quality than some anchor chains of other countries.If you live elsewhere in the world and don't wish to buy an imported chain, local sailors or fishermen may be able to advise you.  An anchor rode formed from lengths of both rope and chain provides some of the benefits and downsides of each, but requires an additional shackle joint to keep the two lengths tightly fastened.In the end, the chain vs. rope discussion has many factors involved, and you may want an experienced boat owner to help you make the decision.   If you use an all-chain rode, it is still a good idea to attach a nylon rope "snubbing line" to make the rode heavier and more elastic. One end of this rope is tied to a bow cleat, while a special chain hook tool attaches the other to the chain 4 feet (1.2m) or more from where the chain is attached to the bow., Nylon rope should be 3/16" (4.8mm) in diameter for a craft under 10' (3m) in length and 3/8" (9.5mm) for a craft under 20' (6m). Increase the diameter by an additional 1/8" (3.2mm) for each additional 10' (3m) in length beyond 20 feet (6 meters).Chain can be 1/8" (3.2mm) smaller in diameter than rope would be for that size of boat.  Your charts should tell you the depth of the water and note any designated anchoring locations.Try to find a location with a flat bottom suitable for your anchor type (soft and relatively weed-free is usually best). Avoid areas of strong current or areas open to the weather, especially during an overnight stop.   If you're aiming to end up over a fishing spot or other specific area, keep in mind the anchor location should be well upwind of the area your boat will end up.  Measure the depth of the chosen spot and multiply by 7: this is roughly how far your boat will drift from your anchor.If the current or wind changes, your boat could swing to the other side of the anchor; make sure it has sufficient space in every direction. Never anchor your boat somewhere where its swing radius will intersect another boat's.   Never assume the other boats have the same anchor line (or "anchor rode") length as you do, or that they will drift in the same direction. Ask other boat owners where their anchors are dropped and how long the rode is if you're not sure. The instructions below give you more exact instructions for determining the length of your anchor line.  Circle the spot you've chosen fully, taking depth measurements. This will reveal any hidden shoals or other obstructions that could damage your boat if it drifts while anchored.If you do find dangerous shallow areas, you'll need to find another place to drop anchor.  You should know the timing of the next tide and the range of water level between high tide and low tide, so you aren't caught unawares. If you're staying longer than an hour or two, you should check the weather forecast so you're prepared for any high wind or storms., You should now have a good idea of the nature of your location. If you expect high winds or a strong tide, or if your anchor coming loose could cause a collision, you should use a heavy storm anchor with excellent holding power. For most situations, your ordinary main anchor or light "lunch anchor" will do.   See Selecting an Anchor for more information. In rough circumstances, you may need to use one anchor at the bow and a second anchor at the stern. Only do this if nearby boats are using this method, as boats using one or two anchors swing by different amounts and easily foul each other's lines., When you stop, the current or wind should push you slowly backward away from the spot. This is when you should drop the anchor.If the water is calm, you may need a helmsman to reverse the engines at idle speed. It's better to work out hand signals for "start", "stop", "more power", and "less power" in advance, rather than attempting to shout across the boat., Before you drop your anchor, determine how much you'll line, or rode, you'll need, then use a cleat hitch to tie it at that distance. The term scope refers to the ratio between the length of your rode and the distance from the bow to the bottom. A good rule of thumb is a scope of at least 7:1 for a rope rode, or 5:1 for a heavier all-chain rode. Increase the scope to 10:1 or more for stormy conditions or if your anchor keeps ripping free of the bottom. The longer the scope, the closer to horizontal your rode is, and the more tightly you will be anchored.Measure from the bow, not the water surface. If the water is 10 feet deep (3m), and your bow is 4 feet (1.2) m above the water surface, the total depth is 14 feet (4.2m). A typical scope of 7:1 would require 14 x 7 = 98 feet of rode (4.2 x 7 = 29.4 m). Consult a knot guide for sailors or online tutorial if you do not know how to tie a firm cleat hitch. Only use a shorter scope than listed if you need to avoid drifting into obstacles and cannot find any suitable anchorage spot with more space. Do not rely on a short scope for rough weather or overnight stays.  Keep the anchor rode tight at first to help you aim the anchor until you feel it hit bottom. Then slowly play out the rode at the same speed as the boat is moving. It should end up in a straight line across the bottom, not piled up in a heap that could get tangled.   Be careful to avoid getting your hands or feet caught in the rode, which could cause serious injury. Instruct passengers of the danger and keep kids and animals away. Don't throw your anchor overboard; let it down slowly to avoid fouling your own rope.Never drop an anchor from the stern unless there is already an anchor holding the bow and you need extra anchorage. Anchoring from the stern only could cause your boat to capsize.  Your boat will probably turn across the current or wind as you move. After you've let out about 1/3 of the total rode you determined you'd use, cinch it off and wait for the boat to straighten out. This will straighten the rode you've let out and gently set the anchor into the bottom.If your boat won't straighten out, your anchor is drifting and you need to try again. Pick another spot if possible.  Uncinch the anchor rode and let it out as the boat once again drifts backward. Cinch it again once a total of 2/3 the rode length has been played out. Let the boat's momentum straighten it out and set the anchor more firmly. Repeat this process one more time, letting out the rest of the rode length you determined was necessary.  Tie the anchor rode firmly around a bow cleat. Give it a tug to test the anchor is set, although be aware it will require further setting as described below. If not, you'll need to repeat this process. Try to find a different spot with better conditions.  First, find two stationary objects on the shore, and note their positions relative to each other from your perspective. (For instance, a tree in front of a lighthouse, or two boulders a thumb's width apart if you hold your hand at arm's length.) Signal the helmsman to gently start the engine in reverse until the rode straightens, then signal him or her to return to neutral. The boat should drift back to a stationary position where the two objects you noted appear in exactly the same position relative to each other.If the two objects are in different positions and you remained standing in the same spot throughout this procedure, you are not anchored and need to begin again. Try to arrange hand signals with your helmsman in advance, rather than attempting to shout across the boat.  This is called snubbing the anchor, and jams a set anchor more firmly into the bottom. Have your helmsman reverse hard until the rode straightens out, then kill the engine.   Check your bearings again as your helmsman does this, to double check the anchor hasn't pulled free.  Take the bearings of several objects around you and note them in your log book. Do this immediately after anchoring, and 15–20 minutes after anchoring to make sure the anchor set properly.Keep checking every hour or few hours, depending on how long you'll be anchored.   GPS units often have an alarm setting that will alert you if you drift.If you are going to be staying overnight, try to find at least one object that will be lit. If you can't, you should use a GPS unit. For an overnight stay or other long stop, arrange an anchor watch rotation in advance so the crew can take turns checking to make sure you haven't drifted.	Consider a general purpose fluke anchor. Research plow anchors for areas of high or changing current. Only use mushroom anchors for light use. Research other types of anchors for specialized uses. Use several anchors for different purposes. Use high quality anchors. Make sure you have deck cleats or anchor rollers suitable for your anchors. Learn how to pick a nylon anchor line. Understand which anchor chain is best to use. Consider using both materials. Use rope or chain of sufficient diameter. Use your charts and eyesight to choose a good location. Measure the depth at that location and check the space available. Circle the possible anchorage location while making depth measurements. Check the weather and tide information. Consider which anchor to use. Slowly approach the confirmed spot from downwind and stop when over it. Determine how much line to let out and cleat it at that point. Slowly lower your anchor over the bow (front of the boat). After 1/3 of the rode has been let out, cinch it off and let the boat straighten. Continue to let out the scope and straighten the boat twice more. Tie off the line around a bow cleat. Check you're anchored using reference points. Use your engine to give the anchor a final hard set. Take compass bearings regularly.
, Avoid sweeping in a pendulum pattern in which the detector comes up high off of the surface of the ground when it goes to the far right or far left in your sweeping pattern.  If you do not slightly overlap your sweeps, then you may miss small deposits between swept areas.  Gold rarely occurs in small swaths, so prepare to excavate more deeply if you find a small nugget.	Transport yourself and your equipment to the area that you have chosen to prospect.  , On the land move the metal detectors coils side-to-side and low along the surface of the ground. Perform overlapping sweeps. Treat all positive findings as indicators of larger deposits.
First, make a slipknot by looping the yarn around your index and middle finger twice Then, pull one loop through the other and tighten the loop by pulling the tail gently as yu slide the loop off your finger and onto the hook. Slide this loop onto your hook and then make a chain of four stitches.Use a slipstitch to join the first and last stitches in the chain and make a circle. To slipstitch, insert the hook into the first stitch in the chain with the last stitch you made still on the hook. Then, yarn over and pull through both loops.; , Chain one stitch to start the petal and then do four triple crochet stitches into the center of the chain circle to form the first petal. Repeat the triple crochet stitch three more times for a total of four stitches.To triple crochet, loop the yarn around the hook twice. Then, insert the hook into the center of the circle and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the center of the circle, and the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first two stitches on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the next two stitches on the hook. Finally, yarn over again and pull through the remaining stitches on the hook to complete a triple crochet stitch., To return to the center and give the petal a slightly curved shape, insert the hook into the center of the circle, yarn over and then pull through the first loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook to complete the single crochet stitch.To single crochet, insert your hook into the center of the circle and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the loop on the hook to form a new loop. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull it through both of the loops., Start the next petal by chaining one and then make four triple crochet stitches and single crochet into the center. Keep repeating this sequence until you have made a total of five petals.After you do the last single crochet stitch into the center, you can cut the yarn a few inches from the last stitch and pull through to secure it. Tie it into a second knot and preserve the tail to weave in later.  The easiest way to create a wide variety of crocheted flowers is to use different colors of yarn. Choose three or more colors to use for the flowers in your flower garland.   For example, you could use three different shades of pink, or three totally different colors, such as red, yellow, and blue.  If you want to add some variety in the types of flowers in your garland, you can also try making some more advanced flowers. Some of the more advanced flowers you can try include:   Pansies Roses Cone shaped flowers  , Adding roses to your crocheted flower garland can also add some variety. Try using some green yarn to create small simple leaves to crochet next to and in between your flowers., Make a chain that is 24 or more links long to accommodate all of your flowers. You can space out the flowers as much or as little as you like. Make sure that the chain will be long enough for the amount of flowers you have made.   Count your flowers and decide how much space you want to go in between each of them to decide how long your chain should be. For example, if you have 10 flowers and you want to have five spaces between each of them, then make a chain of 55. This will allow you to place one flower every five stitches and still have five stitches on the end. Try using green yarn to give the chain a vine-like effect., Begin to single crochet along your garland until you reach the first spot where you want to connect a flower. Then, insert the hook through the chain first and then through the part of the flower you want to connect to the garland, such as through the edge of one of the petals. Loop the yarn over, and then pull it through the flower and the chain to secure it.   Continue to single crochet along the garland until you reach the next spot where you want to attach a flower. If desired, you may single crochet through two stitches in the petal to ensure that it is secure or that the flower will hang a certain way., When you have connected all of your flowers and reached the end of the garland, you can cut the yarn and secure it with a knot. Pull the last loop out and then cut it in the center. This will leave a tail that you can tie into the stitch to keep it secure.	Chain four and join in a circle. Chain one and triple crochet four times. Finish the first petal with a single crochet into the center. Repeat the sequence four more times. Use different colors. Try a few advanced flowers. Add some leaves. Chain 24 or more. Single crochet along the garland to connect your flowers. Cut and tie off at the end of the row to secure the garland.
Do not put them in the washer; otherwise, they will be completely ruined.; , That way, they will form to your foot. This method will help them to fit better and last longer.  To clean your shoes:   Dip the toothbrush in the water and soap. Gently scrub the shoe. Wipe the dirt off with a lightly dampened cloth.    Do not spray the Windex directly onto the shoe. Instead, spray it onto the paper towel before rubbing the shoe with it.  Mr. Clean Magic Eraser also works well. However, avoid using this method too often. The wetness will dry out the leather and can lead it to crack. It helps to only clean leather when there is an audition or performance. , Concentrate most on the areas of the shoe that are partially dirty or well worn.  Leave in indirect warmth. Do not leave underneath a heater or in direct sunshine, as these are too drying.	Hand wash leather ballet shoes. Wear the shoes in while still slightly damp until they dry completely. Leather ballet shoes can be cleaned using a combination of an old, soft-bristled toothbrush, water, and a few drops of dishwashing soap (ex: Dawn (R) - not Cascade (R). Leather ballet shoes can also be cleaned with a paper towel and Windex. Clorox and most kinds of cleansing wipes are faster ways to wipe down leather ballet shoes. Get a pint of milk and a soft sponge.  , Gently dab the ballet shoes with the milk. Leave in a warm place to dry.
Molly is also an exceptional singer, and the bandleader of The Perfs. Get about six more people. Go for people with cool names, such as how two Perfs are named Chloe and Dakota.   If you want to, you can write songs and make music videos to become more popular. If you form a band, make sure you're the leader. Make sure you can dance.	Learn how to sing.
For a the classic Disney look, you'll need to buy or make an outfit that looks like the one Snow White wears in the cartoon. This will, at minimum, include:   A dress with a cream or yellow ankle-length skirt. A blue bodice with a scoop neck and thin, vertical gold braid down the center. Blue and red slashed sleeves or blue sleeves embellished with red laces tied in bows. A high, stiff white collar. A white petticoat with a lacy or ruffled edge. Tan (or neutral) low-heeled pumps with matching bow clips. A blue cape lined with red (optional).; , Snow White's hair is described as "black as ebony."It is styled in a chin-length bob with soft waves, parted in the center. She wears a red ribbon tied in a bow at the top of her head.   If you're already a brunette with chin-length hair, add curl to your hair. Gently comb it out to create soft waves, part it in the center and add the ribbon. If not, cut, dye, and style your hair to match Snow White's, or buy a wig that imitates her style. Some modern depictions of Snow White show her with a tiara instead of a hair bow. Either one will work, though a bow might be truer to people's image of this character.  Snow White's complexion is "white as snow" and her lips are "red as the rose."She has dark eyebrows, long, dark eyelashes and rosy cheeks. If you do not have these features, you can use makeup to achieve the look by:   Applying a pale foundation and a layer of matching powder for a porcelain skin look. Dusting a little pink blush on your cheekbones.  Darkening your eyebrows with a pencil, if necessary.  Applying a neutral colored eyeshadow to your eyelids. Line your upper and lower lids with black eyeliner. Use mascara to lengthen and darken your eyelashes. Outline your lips with red or neutral lip liner, and fill in with a matte lipstick in a deep red.  Snow White is described as gentle, cheerful, helpful and kind.She is also very feminine and proper. If you want to take your costume beyond just looks, here's how:   Snow White always has a cheerful outlook no matter what.She's able to dream of meeting a prince even when serving as a lowly kitchen maid. To achieve this yourself, look on the bright side as often as you can. Like Snow White, sing or hum while you work. Don't forget to smile! Be helpful to others whenever you can.Hold a door open, pick up something that someone dropped, stay to help clean up after a meal or party. Ask your friends and family, "What can I do to help?" Show kindness to others.Be encouraging. Listen with empathy. If you know someone is going through a hard time, send them a card or tell them you are thinking of them. And you should always refrain from gossiping. Be as feminine as you can. Speak in a high, sweet voice. Learn to move gracefully by taking small, measured steps. Let men take care of things like pulling out chairs, or putting on your coat. Use proper manners and etiquette.	Get the garments. Style your hair. Apply your makeup. Adopt her personality traits.
The #61 material rods are widely used for commercial AM (550 KHz to 1660 KHz )To get good reception the radio needs a few micro volts of received signal. Improving weak reception you may increase the mass of this core. Some designs use 5 each rods bundled together and wrapped with the right length of wire. , Finally the antenna should be mounted securely inside a PVC pipe to protect it and facilitate aiming this directionally., A good choice is to use a ferrite rod or high carbon steel rod, 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) in diameter and 7 inches (17.8 cm) long. Wind it with 90 turns of insulated 22g wire, which will cover the entire AM band without needing any special tuning, and will also give you additional reception well into the short-wave bands if you need it. A preamplifier is usually a good idea with setups like this., A good AM band antenna can be strung between two trees or across the roof of a house along the ridgeline or over to a nearby tree. A modest twenty-foot length of insulated wire will give your receiver greatly improved reception with far less static than any ferrite antenna can hope for. In part, this is because signal pickup is occurring at a significant distance from the interference-generating appliances in your house. Use good quality ceramic insulators for holding the ends of the antenna wire and ALWAYS add a commercial lightning arrestor (Radio Shack again) where the antenna will attach to the house., This means yearly or even sooner adjustments, so check the tips area for ways to avoid this. Place your arrestor directly above the point where your lines enter the house so that lightning can take the most direct route to ground. For your ground, run a very heavy gauge copper wire straight down from the arrestor to a water pipe, or drive a 6' copper pipe or ground bar directly into the earth there. Then attach the ground wire to your ground with a brass or copper grounding clamp. This same connection also makes an excellent ground for your receiver. A shielded cable lead-in wire (like coaxial cable) can give superior results if your residence has unusually noisy appliances or other EM noise., The vast majority of long wire antennas will be considerably less than a quarter of the wavelength at AM band frequencies and behave as though a small capacitor is connected in series to the wire. An inductor will resonate with this capacity and will increase the overall signal strength significantly. The required inductance range for AM is from about 200 microHenrys (mH) at the high end of the band to about 2 millihenrys at the bottom end of the band for a 20 foot (6.1 m) antenna., For AM radio, you can purchase a 4 inch (10.2 cm) PVC pipe outside coupling which you can pick up at any home improvement store (it will actually measure more like four and a half inches in outside dia), and some 22 gauge insulated wire. The coil is then wound with 100 turns, with taps brought out every ten or so turns by twisting a little loop in the wire. The end result will be the pipe fitting wrapped with a continuous turn of wire and a row of little twists sticking up above and along the coil in a row that you will then strip the insulation off of. The antenna attaches to one end of the coil, and the radio is attached to the other end or to any tap along the length as needed. The total inductance of such homemade inductors is usually around a millihenry, so short antennas may need twelve or more turns instead of the usual ten turns for the last two to four lower frequency taps to raise the overall inductance there. You can use a selector knob and attach the taps to the knob to make a clean little boxed device, or you can just move your radio attachment to the different taps directly to adjust your inductance and give your radio antenna that mad scientist look. Lots of books and resources exist for antenna layout and design if this has struck an interest, but trial and error is how the early radio experimenters did it and it still works today.	The ferrite rod antenna in an AM radio uses the property of core material permeability to reduce the length of wire and concentrates the signal.As an option you can add a variable air capacitor parallel to this ferrite, antenna, this will give you increased Q that and better frequency selection. If you are determined to keep antenna length short (which still means reduced reception) and you have access to electronic-grade ferrite or iron rods, a better antenna than most portable radios can be constructed by going bigger. Radio waves are far easier to capture with a copper wire antenna, which is nothing more than a piece of wire stretched between two points, with ceramic, glass, or plastic insulators at each end. The wire may be tied directly to both insulators but as various things (like the tree) move over time, the wire will stretch. If the long wire doesn't give you an acceptable AM signal, one additional option remains: you can add a loading inductor (a type of coil you can make yourself) before the antenna lead enters the radio. A common ham radio trick is to make a loading coil with plastic pipe fittings or pipe and insulated 22 gauge wire.
Alert your crew that you want to jibe. Letting them know will allow them to do their part in preparing and moving the sails. It will also signal them to steer clear of the mainsail and the boom, which will be coming across the boat.Alternatively, you can say "Prepare to jibe."  , The crew member assigned to moving the sails, or the sail trimmer, should get into position and prepare the mainsail for the jibe before responding with "Ready." Once they are in position, they should respond with this verbal command to let the captain of the boat know that they are ready to move the sail. Typically, you'll have more than one crew member on the ship, but you only really need two people to jibe the boat., Jibe-ho will let the rest of the crew know that you are starting to jibe the boat. At this point, the crew can start the mainsail to the other side of the boat and you can begin to turn your boat downwind.	Say "Ready to jibe" to your crew. Have the crew respond by saying "Ready.", Say "Jibing" or "Jibe-ho" to instruct your crew to start the jibe.
It is said that "getting there is half the fun."; , Make sure you have enough to entertain you for however long you are riding the bus. Good things to bring include:   Music player, power supply, and earphones Reading matter Netbook, tablet or laptop computer Hand held game.  It is sometimes helpful to bring an electronic device with you, so that you can watch a movie, play games, text, call people, and more.   If WiFi is available, you could go online.  It is always fun to draw, right? Why not draw during a trip? You could also draw scenery or memorable events. It will be sure to amuse you on the trip. Try not to do it for too long or you will start to feel nauseous from motion sickness.   Try coloring in books for adults or do some Zentangle drawing. Doodles are acceptable too.  You could read from a book, newspaper, magazine, e-book, or other reading item. Try to avoid doing this if you get motion sickness.  Choose something that you would enjoy and that you're not likely to get bored with quickly.  Sit back and relax. Use the things you brought with you. Look out the window at the scenery or talk to other people.  Just keep a calm mentality about the bus ride. This is harder than it sounds but, when mastered, it is a big help in many areas of life.  You could enjoy the scenery or play "I Spy" games to take up time. Just try to think that the ride is going to end soon, and look at the beautiful scenery whizzing past. Paying attention to the county, city, town and village names as you pass through may come in handy if you have any interest in geography or history.  Think of any song, but replace the original lyrics with your own. Your song can have the same tune as the original.  Then eat a snack, then listen to some music or read a book. These will take your mind off the length of the trip, especially naps.  It is sometimes nice to engage in a deep conversation with someone. It will always take up your time. You may also get to know the person a little bit more.  Be patient and have a positive attitude. You won't be so grouchy if you're not being mean.   Avoid snapping at, or arguing with fellow bus members. This will only make the trip dramatic and uncomfortable for everyone. Remember that everyone is stuck in a small space. Stay positive. When people are staring at you, try to communicate with them telepathically to see if they are reading your mind and whether they react.  Travel bingo with two or more players is like real bingo but with scenery. All that you have to find is in your 6 squares. Another person has to draw 6 different things that you are somewhat likely to see out of the window, and cross them out when they are found. If you get 3 squares in a row, you shout "Travel Bingo!"   You can also do more squares than 6 like 8 squares and you have to get 4 squares in a row.	Keep your mind open to more activities that you could do or make up on the trip. Bring fun things to do. Bring your phone, iPad, laptop, tablet, or any electronic device. Bring paper and a pencil. Bring reading material. Think of a hobby or something that would be easy to do on a bus. Chill. Be patient. Stare out of the window. Make a parody and write it down. Take a nap. Talk to a friend or someone else who is close to you. Be courteous to your fellow bus mates. Play travel bingo with someone else.
Give yourself enough time in the morning to dress, shave, and apply makeup. If you need to, wake up 15 to 30 minutes early to make sure you are dressed and groomed before stepping out the door. This way you can avoid having to do these things while driving.If you don’t have enough time in the morning to finish getting ready, then bring your grooming supplies with you in the car. Wait until you arrive at your destination and your car is parked before finishing your grooming routine.; , Before you start the car, make sure to store loose objects that can roll around and distract you while you are driving. Place them in the trunk, a secure bag, or in your glove compartment. This way you can avoid reaching for these objects in the car if they get loose, which can be dangerous.For example, place grooming supplies, clothes and shoes, books, and bags in the trunk or glove compartment.  While sitting in your parked car, confirm and familiarize yourself with the route you will be taking. Also check the traffic report while you are confirming your route. This way, you can avoid having to re-route your GPS while driving.If you are using a GPS, make sure it is set up before you begin driving, and use the voice function so you do not have to glance at your GPS.  Make sure to adjust the climate controls to the correct setting. Also set your radio to the station you want to listen to and adjust the volume while your car is parked.Additionally, make sure to adjust your mirrors, seat, and steering wheel to the correct positions beforehand.  Before you take off, make sure your children are fastened in their car seats or seatbelts. Also make sure your pets are in a cage and the cage is secured with a seatbelt. By doing this, you can avoid having to reach back to adjust your child’s car seat, or your pet’s cage while you are driving.When driving with animals in the car, always make sure they are secured in a cage.	Finish personal grooming at home. Secure loose objects. Decide on your route ahead of time. Adjust your car’s controls beforehand. Fasten children and pets.
When an audience comes to a show, they’re not just looking to hear your songs, they’re looking for a full sensory experience. Coordinate outfits with your band members so that you’ll have a memorable look that makes you stand out from other bands.   Look at stars that have developed their own signature style. Missy Elliot is famous for wearing Adidas tracksuits, Michael Jackson his futuristic, red Thriller outfit, and Ke$ha known for her unique glitter patterns. Choose a signature item that will make you memorable within your own genre of music. Wear that pink hat you’ve always had your eye on, or finally buy yourself a brightly colored suit that nobody will be able to forget. Don’t be afraid to accessorize! Wear jewelry, make-up, and anything else that adds charisma to the performance. For dancers, be sure to wear clothing that doesn’t inhibit movement.  Looking the part also means acting the part on stage. Everybody has different strengths and weakness that need to be practiced, and it’s important to recognize what needs to be worked on. If you struggle with dancing and getting into the music physically, take a dance class. If you’re feeling shaky on hitting higher notes, sign up for a voice lesson. Enroll in an acting class with a teacher that you admire. Getting individualized attention will help you fine tune problematic aspects of your performance and allow your strengths to shine. , For the crowd to notice your moves, you have to make them big and dramatic. Don’t be afraid to exaggerate everything, from vocals and facial expression to jumping around and dancing. Do it big so that your audience notices that you’re into the performance.  At any kind of show, the performer is faced with the task of maneuvering around a very large stage. It’s important to maximize the space you’re given. If you find yourself tending towards a particular side of the stage, be sure to move around and fill the space with your presence.   For musicians, don’t spend the whole show in front of the microphone. Sing into another band member’s mic or dance so that the audience is constantly watching to see what you’ll do next. For actors, moving across the stage and executing lines can be tricky. Be sure to breath properly so that you don’t get winded. If you stay in one place, your performance might seem unbelievable and stunted.  Even if you’re feeling nervous on stage, don’t let it show through your body language. Avoid twiddling your thumbs, pacing, or touching your face. All of these movements show that you’re not in control of your body. Whether you’re a musician, actor, or dancer, be aware of your body positioning in relation to the audience and observe how other experts in your field move on stage. Use good, natural posture and controlled, relaxed body movements.	Choose a stand-out outfit. Get out of your comfort zone. Exaggerate your movements. Take up space. Control your movements and posture.
Before applying your interfacing to the fabric, double-check that it has been been preshrunk either by the manufacturer or by you. Also, depending on if you purchased sewable or fusible interfacing, be sure to follow the specific instructions for that type.  If you purchased fusible interfacing, now is the time to iron it to the fabric. You will iron the glossy or bumpy side of the interfacing to the "wrong" side of the fabric. The best way to do this is to lay down the fabric with the front side facing the table. Then, lay the glossy side of the interfacing on top of the fabric. Instead of directly ironing on the interfacing, lay a thin towel on top of your interfacing to protect the materials from sliding around or sticking to the iron.         Be sure the interfacing is smoothly ironed onto the entire tie surface.  If you bought interfacing that has no glue, and was made to be stitched on, you will have to sew it to the fabric. This is a good option if you purchased a tie fabric that is sensitive to heat. You can sew on the interfacing by hand using a needle and thread or a sewing machine. Sew the interfacing to the "wrong" side of the tie fabric, and go around the entire edge of the tie.	Check your interfacing. Iron on the interfacing. Sew on the interfacing.
You can stitch its end closed and angle its base somewhat to make it sit at something other than a right angle to the trunk. 45 degrees is a good angle to aim for, but since mother nature has endless variations of angles available, there is no need to obsess over the exact angle. ,,,   Add "spikes". Tie the yarn lengths every other loop along the ridges formed by your single crochet. Trim the yarn ends to a length that looks pleasing to you (one quarter inch to one half inch, or .6 to 1.2 cm works well). Glue the finished cactus into the pot if desired. Hot glue works well, as will craft glue.	Sew the branch to the side of the trunk using matching green yarn or thread. Sew the trunk to the dirt using whichever yarn color will be least noticeable.  , Stuff your clay pot with a bit of batting.  , Place the cactus (and its attached "dirt" into the pot.  , Cut yarn "spikes" to length by wrapping it around something sturdy (three fingers work well) and cutting the resulting loops in half to create 1.5 to 2 inch (3.8 to 5 cm) lengths.
Heat it for 10-15 mins.; ,, Bend them slowly or they will break. One ice-cream stick can make a half of the bracelet so two ice-cream sticks equals to a whole bracelet if you use a mould that is big. If the mould is small then possibly an ice-cream stick can make a bracelet.  Place them in a cool, dry place or under a fan or AC or in a cool air room or cupboard. This aids in the quick drying of the ice-cream sticks. If you want, just leave them out under the sun or anywhere dry and cool not wet.  Check whether its hard and not still soft. if it is hard, then move on!  , It looks like a bangle if you are using 2 ice-cream sticks and it would look like a bangle similar to the one using with 2 sticks except with a bit space in the bracelet if you are using a stick.	For the modeling, take out a saucepan half filled, or filled with  water and add 2 ice-cream sticks to make a bracelet. Remove the saucepan and let the ice cream sticks cool down for about 2-3 mins so that they can be bent easily without breaking.  , Take any mould in a circle shape and fix the ice-cream sticks in them. Leave them to dry for 24 hours. Remove them out slowly. After removing them carefully, use the masking tape to tape the ends together forming a kind of circle.
White or black balloons both make striking swan sculptures.  Create a paperclip shape with the balloon; the knotted end should be at the center of the paperclip, and the tail end should jut out from the end of the paperclip. Another way to approach this shape is to create a circle with overlapping ends, then flatten it.  Grasp the folded balloon in the middle so that you're holding three parts: the top of the paperclip, the bottom of the paperclip and the knot in the center. Twist the three parts together, making sure you catch the knot in the twist. Hold the twist to make sure it doesn't come undone. You now have two loops with a long neck jutting out from the center twist.  Use your free hand to close one of the loops and push it up through the other one. This creates the body of the swan, with the tucked-in loop resembling folded wings and the outer loop resembling the swan's underside. Tucking in the loop also keeps the structure from coming undone.  Grasp the neck a few inches from the tail and use your hand to move some of the air into the uninflated tail part. This will cause the top of the neck to curve into the shape of the head. The remaining uninflated tail forms the swan's beak.	Inflate a balloon and leave a 4-inch tail. Fold the balloon. Make a basic twist. Tuck one loop into the other. Make the head.
, The fruit trees that establish quickest generally have trunks with diameters ranging from 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to 5/8 inch (1.6 cm).  Trees with crooked trunks are more likely to topple when burdened with fruit or during windy weather.  These make it difficult to walk beneath the trees at harvest time. Low branches also make lawn maintenance difficult and offer easy perches for animals that will eat the fruit., There should be clearly defined leader branches growing in the middle.  Choose fruit trees with abundant roots that appear healthy and free of injuries.	Go to a tree nursery or quality garden center.  , Look at trunk diameter when choosing trees. Select fruit trees with straight trunks. Avoid trees with low branches. Choose trees with crowns of branches spreading out uniformly all around. Examine the trees' roots.
Here's a list of what you will need to make one:   Wooden clothespins Magnet (sheet is recommended) Glue Decorations, such as paint, washi tape, etc  , They must be the type that have a spring in them. The solid wood ones that don't open and close won't be suitable for this.  This is where you can get really creative. However you decide to decorate it, make sure that you leave the back blank, or you won't be able to glue the magnet on. Also, make sure that you can still open and close the clothespin. Here are some decorating ideas:   Cover the top and sides of your clothespin with washi tape. Washi tape is a type of patterned scrapbooking tape. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Paint your clothespin using a small paintbrush and acrylic paint. You can paint it all one color, or many colors. Simple designs, such as stripes, will work best on the clothespin. Glue a thin, flat wooden shape, such as a cat or dog, to the top of the clothespin. The wooden shape should be about the same length as the clothespin. You can find the wooden shapes in the wood section of an arts and crafts store. Glue down some buttons down the center of your clothespin. Play around with different shapes, colors, and patterns, just make sure that the buttons are the same width as the clothespin.  Depending on how you decorated it, this can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Some decorations, such as washi tape, don't require any drying time.  Cut a strip of magnetic sheeting down to fit the back of your clothes pin. If you are using round, button magnets, plan on using two magnets per clothespin.  You can use an industrial strength glue or hot glue. Draw a line of glue down the back of the clothespin and press the magnet down into the glue.   If you are using round button magnets, place a drop of glue on the top and bottom of the clothespin back. Press the round button magnets into the glue.  Once the glue dries, you can use the clothespin to hold recipes and memos to the door of your fridge.	Gather your supplies: Clothespins can make great magnets because you can use them to clip and hold things such as memos and recipes. Buy some wooden clothespins. Decorate your clothespin. Allow the clothespin to dry, if necessary. Cut your magnet down to fit your clothespin. Glue the magnet to the back of your clothespin. Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.
It's one of the most obvious constellations, so it makes a good starting point.  If you look next to Rigel in Orion, you should find two stars. The bottom one (very dim, may not be seen) is Lambda Eridani, and the top one is Cursa. This is the start of Eridanus, the river., The stars are a bit dim. Use small binoculars or a finder scope if you're having trouble., From Epsilon Eridani, You need to hop to Eta Eridani, then down to Tau 1 Eridani. Once you've done that, the river keeps going in the opposite direction (left instead of right). From Tau 9 Eridani, you have another big jump to Upsilon 2 Eridani., You should see a pair of stars. They are 43 and 41 Eridani. Next to them, you should see a little triangle of stars, with a fourth star in the middle., The first should be from 41 Eridani through the top star in the triangle. The second should be through the bottom two stars in the triangle. The galaxy is where the lines meet. You may need to go slightly to the left (increase right ascension).	Find Orion.  Find Cursa.  From Cursa, follow Eridanus along.  Beware, the next two jumps are quite big!, From Upsilon 2 Eridani, go down.  To find the galaxy, draw two lines.
However, glazed clay, plastic or ceramic pots may work as well for you if you are careful not to over-water as this could cause standing water in the pot.   Wide pots are preferable to tall narrow pots which can cause stress to your cactus. Wide pots allow the shallow root system to spread out naturally while deep pots do not.  Be sure the pot has good drainage holes.   Avoid pots which are too large. Large pots hold water which can lead to root rot.	Plant your cactus in an unglazed clay pot if possible because it will allow water to more easily evaporate. Place coarse gravel or lava rocks in the bottom of your pot before adding the potting soil.

Make sure your motor mount slots allow your engine to slide forward slightly, and then tack the mount into place.No dimensions are included here deliberately, as the size of your mount will change according to engine.   The motor mount should be welded as the final step to building your kart. Your mount should be able to hold your lawn mower engine in the horizontal position.  About 4" away from the middle of the throttle pedal bolt hole, weld this tab to your kart on a 45 degree angle.  Take your brake rod and insert it through the tab, bending it to adjust it to the brake band. Next, take the tab with the rod inserted and weld it to the kart.  Bend this 1/4" round rod so that it angles to meet your brake pedal assembly. Cut the length of your brake rod as needed, and weld eyelets to the rod with a return spring installed brake pedal.  Many go-kart kits do not bolt seats directly to the kart. If this is the case for you, use a simple frame and bolt this into the seat braces. Your seat should be cut at a 37.5 degree angle for a 105 degree incline for your backrest., There are many different designs you can use, but the traditional side rail is formed of three pieces joined to form a rectangular rail with the side and back of the frame.   Side rails are an optional addition for your go-kart.  Having finished with the body of your go-kart, you can now weld the mount to your frame. Upon completing your weld, you can add tires, seat padding, and all other necessary hardware to your vehicle.	Install your motor mount. Attach the throttle cable guide tab. Put in the brake rod guide tab. Bend your brake rod into shape. Give yourself a seat. Choose your side rails. Weld motor mount and attach accessory parts.
All colors are lovely but it is best to stick to one color or to only vary within the same color range, ombre style.   The rosebuds should be fresh but not wet before use.; , They should all be at the same even length.   Don't cut them too short; they need a little length to spike into the foam ball.	Choose rosebuds which are as small and closed as possible. Cut the rose stems to short stubs.
To make delicate paper flowers that look similar to carnations, you need just a few simple supplies:          3 sheets of tissue paper in the same color A pair of scissors A ruler and a pencil A pipe cleaner Clear tape Florist tape; , Use the scissors to cut a rectangle measuring 12 inches (30.48 cm) long and 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide from the tissue.  First draw a line with a ruler and pencil, a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) from the bottom of your tissue paper rectangle. Draw a diagonal line from the top corner on 1 side that connects to the first line.  The smaller piece of tissue paper is excess and can be discarded.  Cut straight lines from the top of the diagonal. The cuts should stop at the pencil line drawn straight across the tissue paper.  Tape the top of the pipe cleaner along the short side of the tissue paper using tape. , Use clear tape to prevent it showing. , This will finish the carnation.	Gather materials. Cut a rectangle from the tissue paper. Draw lines on the rectangle. Cut along the diagonal line. Create fringe. Insert the stem. Roll the tissue paper around the stem.         , Tape the edge of the tissue paper down around the stem. Wrap florist tape around the top of the stem and bottom of the flower.         , Pull the tissue paper tabs away from the center. Finished.
Every movie starts out with the script! If you have a computer, go to Microsoft Office Word and get to writing! Make sure your story is legit, and isn't a duplicate of someone else's movie. You can get in trouble!  Get the opinions of your cast, crew, and friends. They'll help you work out any problems, and can offer good suggestions.       ; , The story needs some characters to fill out the depth, and personality of the movie. The characters need to be fresh, and different from one another. Make one character the main protagonist, and make the other an antagonist. The other characters will be minor roles.  Is the protagonist a guy, or a girl? How evil is the antagonist? So many questions, but you can figure them all out! Take some time, and you should have your hero and villain all played out in your mind, and in your script!  Make your characters are three-dimensional and realistic as you can. Any antagonist or protagonist worth their salt would not do anything without a reason.  You need a cast to play as the characters, right? You also need a crew to help you out. Get your friends together, and give them roles in either the movie, or the production.  You don't want to have a man playing as the female character, do you? No, you shouldn't. Which is why you must audition your actors/actresses to confirm that he or she is good for the role.  He did a good job! He deserves a major role.

At first, it's generally easiest to grip the needle between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. Hold the thread comfortably between the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand. Raise the needle and the thread up to your eye level, about two inches apart. Make sure that there's plenty of light to see everything clearly!   Consider pinching the thread between your fingers so that only the tiniest tip is visible. If you're having trouble, this technique might help you steady the thread., Line the tip of the thread up with the eye-hole, and make sure that you have a clear view of the hole. Keep your hands steady. Push the thread slowly and surely through the eye-hole until you see it poke through the other side.   Try holding the needle sideways, so that you can't see the eye, but you can see the thread as soon as it peeks through the eye.This may take a couple of attempts. Keep trying! If you're having trouble, try moistening and smoothing the tip of the thread again. If you keep trying, but you can't get it, consider using a needle with a bigger eye-hole.  Use your fingertips to carefully tug more of the thread through the eye. Go for at least 10cm (four inches) so that there's little chance of the thread-tip slipping back through.Let this end hang through the needle eye, and shift your attention to the other end of the thread.	Hold the thread in one hand and the needle in the other. Guide the thread into the eye of the needle. Pull the thread through.
To make a "G" chord (major) "G-B-D" a minor chord, lower the "B" one half step (make it B flat).	Simply make the note in the third half a step lower.
Use a clean, lint-free dusting cloth. Rub it gently and carefully along the surface of the object. Move to an unsoiled area of the cloth when the fabric gets dirty.         Try a cotton cloth, or a fabric from nylon fibers made specifically for wiping away dust.; , Place your object on a padded surface. Hold the nozzle of a vacuum about an inch away from the pottery. Apply suction as you brush the object’s surface with a soft paintbrush.         If possible, use a vacuum cleaner that has a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) and modifiable suction. Use less suction for tiny or very delicate items.  Use a hairdryer on a low, cool setting. Rub a soft, lint-free cloth or a soft brush over your pottery as you blow it with air. Try a can of compressed air to get into crevices.	Wipe off dust with a dry cloth. Use suction. Use forced air.
Goji berry plants are drought tolerant and hardy to at least USDA zone 5. If you are not in the right zone, you might consider growing the plant in a container, allowing you to move it between the indoors and outdoors, as needed.; , Goji berry plants can be purchased online or found at local nurseries.  Always check the scientific name (Lycium barbarum), so that you know you are buying the correct plant.   If your nursery does not have the plant, ask if they can order it in for you.  Plant the goji berry plant in a spot that receives at least 6 hours of sun.   , Plant in either the spring or fall. When planting, mix 2/3 soil from the planting hole with 1/3 compost.   ,, Alternatively, you may prune the plant to about 4' and grow it more like a shrub.  The goji berry plant may flower and fruit the first growing season. The small flowers are a pretty light purplish color. As the plant gets older, you will have a longer fruiting time period. At around four years old, the plant will likely produce fruit most of the growing season, which is May through October.	Check that you are in the right growing zone. Find the plant. Choose a suitable garden location. Plant the goji berry plant. Water thoroughly right after planting.  , Allow the plant to grow several feet tall with support. Know when to expect a harvest.
Suitable fruit includes apples, pears, oranges, mandarins, lemons, etc. Choose good quality specimens, as these will be on display.   Seasonal fruit is good, as it's affordable and likely to be in the best condition. It also helps to celebrate the season.; , You could use cord, raffia, thin ribbon, string, etc. The method for wrapping is as follows:   Wind the cord around the fruit in the same manner as for tying string around a parcel. Tie a strong knot to secure in place at the top. Leave plenty of cord intact for hanging the fruit from at the top and for adding decoration at the bottom.  This is what the fruit bauble will hang from.  Beads, dried citrus slices, herbs, etc., can be threaded on. Tie a firm knot to keep the decorative pieces in place. Trim off excess and neaten.   If using raffia, fray the end after cutting for the dangling base piece. This adds a nice touch. If using ribbon, cut the end piece in a V shape, or diagonally, to prevent further fraying.  It's heavier than your standard bauble, so use either a sturdy branch, curtain rod, thick dowel, or other such strong item for hanging from.	Choose the fruit. Wrap the chosen hanging material around the fruit. With the remaining cord, tie a loop at the top. For the bottom hanging cord, thread decorations in place to dangle. Hang the fruit bauble.
You can use just about any type of fabric for this project. It should be about three times the height and width of your pillow., Lay the fabric down, wrong side up, on a flat surface. Set your pillow on top of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered., Fold the top edge of the fabric over the pillow and smooth it down. Repeat with the bottom edge. Make sure that the fabric to either side of the pillow is smooth., Smooth the fabric to the left side of the pillow down first. Fold the top edge down at an angle towards the center, then fold the bottom edge up to meet it. When you are done, you should have a "<" shape., Do the same thing you just did for the left side. Fold the top edge down at an angle, then the bottom edge. When you are done, you should have a ">" shape., Fold the left side down first, then the right. Make sure that they are still folded into points., A square knot is essentially a double-knot.Use the same knot as when starting to tie your shoes. Instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse them: right-over-left, then left-over-right.Keep the fabric folded into points.  If you need to, tuck then inside the knot for extra security.	Cut your fabric. Place your pillow on top of the fabric. Fold the top and bottom edges of the fabric over the pillow. Fold the left side of the fabric into a point. Fold the right side of the fabric to a point. Wrap the sides of the fabric over the front of the pillow. Tie the ends of the fabric into a square knot. Tuck the ends of the fabrics under the knot.
They are often called "bone rings." You can find them in the drapery section or crochet section in a fabric store. A well-stocked craft store may also carry them.  Aim for something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter.  Measure the diameter of the ring. Multiply it by 21/2. Draw a circle on a sheet of cardstock with the new measurement as the diameter. Cut the circle out.If your fabric is a pattern on it, cut a circle out of the middle of your template. The circle needs to be the same size as your ring.  Spread your fabric on a flat surface, right-side-down. Place the template on top of the fabric. Trace around the circle using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out when you are done.If your fabric has a pattern on it, make sure that the template is centered. Use the hole in the middle as a guide.  Place your fabric circle wrong-side-up on the table. Set your plastic ring down in the center. Trace around the plastic ring using a tailor's chalk or pen. Keep your line halfway between the ring and the edge of the fabric., Thread your needle and tie both ends of the thread into a knot. Start sewing on the wrong side of your fabric. Finish sewing on the right side of the fabric. Do not knot the thread when you are done.Make sure that the thread you are using is strong, preferably nylon or polyester., Place the ring on the wrong side of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered. Gently pull on the thread until the fabric gathers around the ring. Don't cut the thread yet.If your fabric has a pattern on it, check the front to make sure that it is centered. Adjust it, if needed.  Using the same needle and thread, pass the needle back through some of the gathers, anchoring them in place. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button. Tie the thread into a knot when you are done. Don't cut it yet., Use a knitting needle or small crochet hook to tuck the raw edges of the fabric under itself and into the covered button., Make two small stitches across the back of the button. Pull on the thread to close the gap. Make two more stitches right across the first two, forming an X. Tug on them gently to further close the gap. Knot the thread, then snip it off., Thread a needle with some embroidery floss. Knot the end of the floss, then sew around the button using a straight stitch or a backstitch. Keep your stitches against the inside edge of the ring. When you are back where you started, knot the floss on the back of the button, then cut it.You can use matching or contrasting embroidery floss.  Place your button on a sheet of felt. Trace around it using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out.The felt can be the same color as your button, or a contrasting one., Use a small whipstitch to secure the felt to the back of the button. When you are back where you started, pull the needle under the felt and out through the center-back of the button. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.  Place a pen over the back of the button. Make two stitches over the pen and through the felt. Make sure that the stitches are coming out of the same spot. When you are done, slide the pen out. You should now have a loop made out of thread.You can also use a pencil, crochet hook, knitting needle, or paintbrush.  Wind the thread around the shank to make it thicker. When you are done, knot the thread to the bottom of the shank. Pull the needle and thread through the felt, and out on the other side of the shank. Snip off the excess thread. Your button is now complete!	Get a small, plastic ring. Make your template. Trace the circle onto cotton fabric, then cut it out. Sketch out your stitching guidelines. Sew a simple straight stitch around the edge of your fabric. Gather the fabric around the ring. Tack the gathers into place. Fold the raw edges of the fabric inside. Sew the gap shut. Sew around the button, just inside the ring. Cut a circle out of felt. Stitch the felt to the back of the button. Make the shank. Reinforce the shank.
You can also use a large piece of cardboard on any hard surface like concrete. The main idea is that you'll be able to slide easily around the surface of the material.       ; , Breakdancing is truly a sport that requires physical exertion and athletic moves. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes.  Pick music with an upbeat, steady rhythm and a flow that you can feel. The most important aspect of the music is that you feel inspired and energized by it.  One of the first things any boy should learn is the difference between "breakdancing" and "Bboying". Bboying is the first term made to describe the dance; it's usually the term used when in the community. The term "breakdancing" was invented by the mainstream media in the 1980s to market the dance. Recently, serious performers have tried to reclaim the name "Bboying" for their performance.          The dance is called B-boying whether the performer is male or female. But when describing a certain individual, there's Bboy (male breaker) and B-girl (female breaker). All breakers have a nickname, such as Bboy Darkness, Bboy Cloud, etc. At first, this shouldn't be too important, but it is in the long run when you want to gain a better hold of who you are as a dancer and gain recognition in your community.  Teched in the breakdancing world means varied. It is used to describe the six- or four-step movements a performer is doing on the ground. When a B-boy's movements are heavily "teched," they are very complex and distinct.	Seek out an open tile, linoleum, or hardwood surface. Put on athletic shoes. Choose your hip hop beats. Know the basic terminology. Know the term "teched."
Include names, addresses, and ages.    Assign numbers to all vehicles involved. Use those numbers when detailing what happened.  For example, driver 1 was stopped at a red light, driver 2 was passing, and driver 3 was making a U-turn.   Show objectivity. Don't assign blame. Let the facts speak for themselves. ,	Identify any witnesses to the accident. Write a detailed narrative describing the accident. Detail the actions of all drivers when the crash happened. Sketch a diagram of the accident.  , Sign and date your traffic crash report.
There are many ways to stream movies on demand nowadays, and it's pretty inexpensive: try Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Media. If you don't have the internet, make a trip to a Redbox or rewatch a movie you've already seen. If you've got a long night alone, watch more than one movie.Make some popcorn or other snacks for extra fun. Movie night isn't the same without some popcorn and movie theater candy, so make a trip to the grocery store for some inexpensive snacks. Watch a classic. If you've got a list of movies you've been meaning to watch, check a couple off of your list. Watch an old Marilyn Monroe movie, or watch back to back John Wayne westerns. Watch a series. Watching all three original Star Wars movies or all three Lord of the Rings films might take a while, but you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in the story. Check out other series like Star Trek, The Hunger Games, or Indiana Jones.  If you understand another language, it can be fun to watch a foreign film without subtitles. If you don't understand any other languages, make up your own comical dialog for the film. Try the foreign film sections of your local film rental shop or Netflix to find an interesting foreign movie.  Using a video camera, a Webcam, or even your phone, make your own movie. Write a simple script and then ad lib your lines to make a comedy, a drama, or a horror film. At the end of the night, make popcorn and hold a "screening" of your film.	Watch a movie. Watch a movie in a different language. Make your own movie.
The following terms are used in the instructions below:   Apollonian Gasket: One of several names for a type of fractal composed of a series of circles nested inside one large circle and tangent to all others nearby. These are also called "Soddy Circles" or "Kissing Circles". Radius of a circle: The distance from the center point of a circle to its edge. Usually assigned the variable r. Curvature of a circle: The positive or negative inverse of the radius, or ±1/r. Curvature is positive when dealing with the outer curvature of the circle and negative for the inner curvature. Tangent: A term applied to lines, planes, and shapes that intersect at one infinitely small point. In Apollonian Gaskets, this refers to the fact that each circle touches each nearby circle at only one point. Note that there is no intersection - tangent shapes do not overlap.; , Descartes's Theorem is a formula that is useful for calculating the sizes of the circles in an Apollonian Gasket. If we define the curvatures (1/r) of any three circles as a, b, and c, respectively, the Theorem states that the curvature of the circle (or circles) tangent to all three, which we will define as d, is: d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )).   For our purposes, we'll generally only use the answer we obtain by putting a plus sign in front of the square root ( in other words, ... + 2 (sqrt(...)). For now, it's enough to know that the subtraction form of the equation has its uses in other related tasks.  In the steps below, we'll make our own simple Apollonian Gasket. It's possible to draw Apollonian Gaskets by hand or on the computer. In either case, you'll want to be able to draw perfectly round circles. This is fairly important. Since every circle in an Apollonian Gasket is perfectly tangent to the circles next to it, circles that are even slightly misshapen can "throw off" your final product.   If drawing the Gasket on a computer, you'll need a program that allows you to easily draw circles of a fixed radius from a central point. Gfig, a vector-drawing extension for the free image editing program GIMP, can be used, as can a wide variety of other drawing programs (see the materials section for relevant links). You will also probably need a calculator application and either a word processor document or a physical notepad for taking notes on curvatures and radii. For drawing the Gasket by hand, you'll need a calculator (scientific or graphing suggested), a pencil, compass, ruler (preferably a scale with millimeter markings, graph paper, and a notepad for note taking.  Your first task is easy - just draw one big, perfectly round circle. The bigger the circle is, the more complex your Gasket can be, so try to make a circle as large as your paper allows or as large as you can easily see in one window on your drawing program.  Next, draw another circle inside the first that's smaller than the original, but still fairly large. The exact size of the second circle is up to you - there is no correct size. However, for our purposes, let's draw our second circle so that it reaches exactly halfway across our large outer circle. In other words, let's draw our second circle so that its central point is the midpoint of the large circle's radius.   Remember that in Apollonian Gaskets, all circles that touch are tangent to each other. If you're using a compass to draw your circles by hand, recreate this effect by putting the sharp point of the compass at the midpoint of the large outer circle's radius, adjusting your pencil so that it just touches the edge of the large circle, then drawing your smaller inner circle.  Next, let's draw another circle across from our first one. This circle should be tangent to both the large outer circle and the smaller inner circle, which means that your two inner circles will touch at the exact midpoint of the large outer circle.  Let's stop drawing for a moment. Now that we have three circles in our Gasket, we can use Descartes's Theorem to find the radius of the next circle we'll draw. Remember that Descartes's Theorem is d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )), where a, b, and c are the curvatures of your three tangent circles and d is the curvature of the circle tangent to all three. So, to find the radius of our next circle, let's find the curvature of each of the circles we have so far so that we can find the curvature of the next circle, then convert this to its radius.   Let's define the radius of our outer circle as 1. Because the other circles are inside this one, we're dealing with its interior curvature (rather than its exterior curvature), and, consequently, we know its curvature is negative. - 1/r = -1/1 = -1. The big circle's curvature is -1. The smaller circles' radii are half as large as the big circle's, or, in other words, 1/2. Since these circles are touching each other and the large circle with their outside edge, we're dealing with their exterior curvature, so their curvatures are positive. 1/(1/2) = 2. The smaller circles' curvatures are both 2. Now, we know that a = -1, b = 2, and c = 2 for our Descartes's Theorem equation. Let's solve for d:  d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )) d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 2 (sqrt (-1 × 2 + 2 × 2 + 2 × -1 )) d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 2 (sqrt (-2 + 4 + -2 )) d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 0 d = -1 + 2 + 2 d = 3. The curvature of our next circle is 3. Since 3 = 1/r, the radius of our next circle is 1/3.  Use the radius value you just found to draw your next two circles. Remember that these will be tangent to the circles whose curvatures you used for a, b, and c in Descartes's Theorem. In other words, they will be tangent to both the original and second circles. For these circles to be tangent to all three circles, you'll need to draw them in the open spaces in the top and bottom of the area inside your large original circle.   Remember that these circles' radii will be equal to 1/3. Measure 1/3 back from the edge of the outer circle, then draw your new circle. It should be tangent to all three of the surrounding circles.  Because they are fractals, Apollonian Gaskets are infinitely complex. This means you can add smaller and smaller circles to your heart's content. You're limited only be the precision of your tools (or, if you're using a computer, the ability of your drawing program to "zoom in"). Each circle, no matter how small, should be tangent to three other circles. To draw each subsequent circle in your Gasket, plug the curvatures of the three circles it will be tangent to into Descartes's Theorem. Then, use your answer (which will be the radius of your new circle) to draw your new circle accurately.   Note that the Gasket we've chosen to draw is symmetrical, so the radius of one circle is the same as the corresponding circle "across from it". However, know that not every Apollonian Gasket is symmetrical. Let's tackle one more example. Let's say that, after drawing our last set of circles, we now want to draw the circles that are tangent to our third set, our second set, and our large outer circle. The curvatures of these circles are 3, 2, and -1, respectively. Let's plug these numbers into Descartes's Theorem, setting a = -1, b = 2, and c = 3:  d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )) d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (-1 × 2 + 2 × 3 + 3 × -1 )) d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (-2 + 6 + -3)) d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (1)) d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 d = 2, 6. We have two answers! However, because we know that our new circle will be smaller than any of the circles it is tangent to, only a curvature of 6 (and therefore a radius of 1/6) makes sense. Our other answer, 2, actually refers to the hypothetical circle on the other side of the tangent point of our second and third circles. This circle is tangent to both of these circles and to the large outer circle, but it would intersect the circles we've already drawn, so we can disregard it.  All Apollonian Gaskets start the same - with a large exterior circle that acts as the edge of the fractal. However, there's no reason that your second circle necessarily has to have 1/2 the radius of the first - we just chose to do this above because it's simple and easy to understand. For fun, try starting a new Gasket with a second circle of a different size - this will lead to exciting new avenues of exploration.   After drawing your second circle (regardless of its size), your next act should be to draw one or more circles that are tangent both to it and to the large outer circle - there's no right way to do this, either. After this, you can use Descartes's Theorem to determine the radii of any subsequent circles, as shown above.	Define key terms. Understand Descartes's Theorem. Gather your digital or analog drawing tools. Start with one large circle. Create a smaller circle inside the original, tangent to one side. Draw an identical circle "across from" the smaller inside circle. Apply Descartes's Theorem to find the size of your next circles. Create your next set of circles. Carry on in this fashion to continue adding circles. For a challenge, try making a non-symmetrical Apollonian Gasket by changing the size of your second circle.
A healing chamber is necessary to protect the newly grafted plants while they are healing. For one or two plants, simply have a large plastic bag handy to place over each plant after the grafting occurs.For a larger number of plants, and a better chance of survival, build or purchase a large wooden or PVC frame, then draping it fully with polyethylene sheeting. Have a tarp or opaque shade cloth ready to block most sunlight from entering the chamber during the first stage of healing.Place a bench in the chamber to hold your plants.   Use a frame with a peaked roof so condensation runs down the sides and doesn't drip onto the plants.; , Place shallow pans of water around the floor of the chamber to increase the humidity. Before you graft any plants, you should monitor the environment in the healing chamber for at least several days to make sure it is stable. The temperature levels should be constant between 70 and 80ºF (21–27ºC) and the humidity should be 80–95%.Note that you should not store any plants in this chamber until they are grafted.  Grafting is most successful on young tomato and eggplant plants, whose stems are still green (herbaceous) instead of woody. The stems should not have grown noticeably thicker, and each plant is usually ready when it has 2–4 true leaves. The most important note to remember is that the two plants should have stems with exactly the same size, so they can grow together without difficulty.   Note that the first one or two leaves the plant grows will be "seed leaves", not true leaves. These should be easily identified as they will be a different shape or size than the true leaves, but the exact appearance depends on species. If it's not possible to find stems of exactly the same size, you must use a rootstock (base) stem larger than the scion (top) stem. The other way around will not work.  Use a sterilized razor blade or sharp knife to cut through the rootstock (base plant) and scion (top plant) stems. While the exact angle is not important, you should use the same angle for each so they fit together as closely as possible. Make the cut in one motion to keep the surface as flat as possible. Discard the top half of the rootstock and the bottom half of the scion plant.   Cut each plant above the smaller lower "seed leaf" but below the higher, full size leaves to prevent the scion plant from attempting to grow roots, which can lead to infection.See Understanding Grafting Basics for more information on rootstock and scion plants.  These clips should be made from silicone or rubber, and should be available at gardening stores or online. Try to match the angles of the cut surfaces as precisely as possible, then hold the plants in place by closing the grafting clip around them.  The plant must have time to grow the two vascular systems together, which allows sap to flow through the plant. During this time, keep the plant in a humid, dark environment to minimize the amount of water loss from the scion plant until this happens.   The healing chamber described earlier is perfect for this, with an opaque shade protecting it from sun. For a smaller operation, put a plastic bag over the plant and keep out of direct sunlight. Water the base of the plant or mist its leaves if the environment is below 85% humidity., You should keep the plant in the special environment for at least 4 days, and it will often take a week before the leaves return to a full, healthy state. Even then, you should gradually alter the environment for another few days, or up to a week.Increase the amount of sunlight it receives gradually and reduce the humidity by occasionally removing a pan of water or lifting up the plastic a little higher.Wilting is normal for the first day, but mist the plant's leaves if it occurs. If the plant continues to wilt for three or four days, the graft was unsuccessful. Although this method is quite reliable, this still happens about 5% of the time even in the best of circumstances., If the plant's leaves are still wilted, they are not likely to survive, or at least not likely to do well this growing season. The healthy plants can now be returned to normal growing conditions for a seedling about to be planted. The exact conditions will vary according to species.  The point where the two plants are joined should be at least 1 inch (2.5cm) above the soil, to reduce the chance of the upper scion plant trying to grow roots. There is no need to remove the grafting clip, which should fall off on its own as the plant grows.Do not hesitate to prune away roots growing from the scion or shoots growing from the rootstock. You may also wish to prune away smaller branches so more energy goes into fruit production.	Construct a healing chamber in advance. Add pans of water to the chamber and monitor the environment. Choose plants that are 2–5 inches (5–13cm) tall and have equal diameters. Cut each plant in half at a 45º angle. Join the two plants together with a grafting clip. Move the new hybrid plant to a humid, dark environment immediately. Gradually return the plant to more sunlight. After two weeks, return surviving plants to normal growing conditions. Plant the hybrid with the graft clip well above the soil.
Sew the leather tag onto the rectangular cloth cutout using needle and thread.	Following the pattern guide, add the leather tag.
List the things you already have. List the things you absolutely need, such as a place to sleep and some way to cook food. Make a wish list. Go crazy here: for example, "I want a large white dresser in French rococo style."; , This will immediately reduce some of your costs if existing things can do double acts, such as a bed with a bland cover and the right pillows along the back can be a couch, and so forth.   Throw rugs can become curtains, and bedspreads turned into drapes. Paint on old pieces of furniture can make them seem new again, as well as suggesting new possibilities for ways of reusing them. Throw slip covers over any chair and suddenly the chair becomes respectable again.  Don't try to buy everything at once. If you snatch the first stick of furniture you find, you pay more than if you wait and look for bargains. When you buy or find any items, think beyond their immediate appearance. You can always paint or alter them. Paint a hideous ecru dresser white and add rococo touches.  Look on Yahoo Groups for Freecycle. Find one that serves a place near you, for example, Michigan Freecycle. Freecycle is a group that uses email to hook up people who want to give or get something for free. You can also look at Freecycle's official website at Freecycle.org.   Look on Craigslist.com. If you open your local Craigslist under "for sale" you can find a subcategory "free." This is a great place to find freebies. Ask your family and friends for furniture that they don't need anymore. Get on Facebook and Twitter and let people know you're willing to take their old stuff off their hands for free. Be specific about what you need and let them know it's for a good cause! Don't neglect the chance of trading or bartering your skills in return for furniture and appliances.  Look for things left on the curb for pick up. Again, with these three entries, think of the long term. College kids leave stuff at the end of a school year, and other people may throw out perfectly good furniture when they buy new furniture.   Designated trash days can be a great time to pick up much needed furniture. Visit recycling depots at municipal landfills. Many of these places keep furniture, appliances and other household items that are still in good condition and sell them for very low prices.  If you don't succeed with Freecycle, Craigslist or your Facebook friends, then you could look at Craigslist in the "for sale" category or visit discounts stores.   Go the resale route. Look at thrift stores such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army. Visit secondhand furniture stores in your area. Don't neglect normal furniture showrooms. Ask them about their floor stock, damaged stock, and sales items. Ask for deep discounts! There are also unfinished furniture stores with inexpensive unpainted and unvarnished items.	Begin by making three lists. See how far items on the first list can cover for items on the second two lists. Start searching. Consider free furniture. Go curb shopping. Look for discounted furniture.
Get ideas of what type of tile you’d like to use on your countertops by browsing tile selection at a specialty shop or home improvement store. Plain ceramic or porcelain will be your cheapest options., While you can attempt to tile your own countertops, you may find it not that much more expensive to have someone do it for you. Contractors can usually get better prices on materials than the general public and you can save yourself from potentially making costly mistakes. Ask your friends and neighbors if they can recommend someone., The fall and winter are contractors' down season, so you will have a better chance at negotiating a good price on tile and/or installation. Check with several tile shops and general contractors to find the cheapest.  If you’re brave enough or have the skills to tile your own countertops, go for it. Tear down your old countertops, cut and install plywood frames and lay your tile. It will take some time and dedication, but you can pocket all the money you’d be spending on a handyman.	Go to a tile shop or home center. Hire a general contractor. Get price quotes in the fall and winter. Tile countertops yourself.
This galaxy jar is simple and easy to make. Because you will be painting it with glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use it again and again. Here's a list of what you will need:Mason jar Glow-in-the-dark paint Paint brush Paint pallet or paper plate Rubbing alcohol; , It would be a good idea to do this, even if the jar looks clean. Any dust or dirt that's on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking. Be sure to scrub off any labels and glue residue.  Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe down the jar. Be sure to get both the inside and the outside. This will get rid of any residue and oils that the soap missed.  You can use any color of glow-in-the-dark paint, but colors such as yellow and orange might look more like stars than purple and green. Glow-in-the-dark paint usually comes in two different forms: liquid paint and puff paint. Liquid glow-in-the-dark paint is just like any acrylic paint and needs to be put in with a paintbrush. Puff paint comes in a bottle with a pointy tip. You can draw with it straight from the bottle.   You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and fabric paint section of an arts and crafts store. It may also be labeled as "3D paint" or "dimensional paint." It has a slightly raised surface when it dries.  It will be easier to dip your paintbrush into a little puddle of paint than into a bottle of paint. Do not pour out too much paint at one time. Most acrylic paints dry quickly. If you pour out too much paint, it may dry up before you finish using it.   If you are using puff paint, you don't need to do this, because you can apply the paint straight from the bottle.  You can paint inside the jar or outside the jar. Painting on the outside will be easier, but the paint will be more likely to get scratched off. Painting on the inside will be harder, but the paint will last longer.   If you are using puff paint, simply take the cap off, and start making little dots all over the jar.  This will make your jar resemble the night sky even more. Look up some of your favorite constellations, and try to copy the pattern onto the jar. Orion, the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper are popular ones.  Most paints should dry within two hours, but some paints (such as puff paints) may take longer. Read the label for more specific drying times. Once the paint is dry, you can put the lid back on. This is not necessary, since there is nothing inside the jar that can fall out.   The sunlight will also activate the glowing particles in the paint.  If the jar does not glow, you might need to leave it under a bright light for a little longer. Most glow-in-the-dark paints need to sit under a bright light for at least two hours.	Gather your supplies. Clean the jar with soap and water. Wipe the jar down with rubbing alcohol. Choose your paint. Pour a coin-sized drop of paint onto a pallet or paper plate. Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and make small dots on the jar. Consider painting some stars, planets, or constellations. Leave the jar in the sun so that the paint can dry. Take the jar into a dark room and watch it glow.
In cooler climates, an area with full sun exposure, where it gets eight to ten hours of direct sunlight is fine. In areas where summer temperatures commonly exceed 80 °F (27 °C), plant it in a spot where it will get six hours of sunlight in the morning and shade in the afternoon.Ornamental kale are annuals, so they only last one season or year. They grow best in the cooler weather of spring and fall. If the ornamental kale does not get enough sunlight, it will grow slowly and the center leaves will not develop their bright colors.; , These plants will commonly continue to thrive in the fall in spite of frost and can survive well into winter in milder climates. In fact, they thrive when temperatures drop to below 60 °F (16 °C).   When planted in early spring, they might survive the summer to flourish again in the fall in cooler climates or when planted in a garden that is shaded from the afternoon sunlight.  Ornamental kale will not do well in slow-draining clay soil. If the garden soil is clay, build a 1-foot high raised bed for the ornamental kale and fill it with sandy or loamy soil.Soil pH is not an issue for this annual.  Use 3- to 6-inch layer of organic matter such as well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss, leaf mold or decomposed pine bark mulch. Mix the organic matter into the garden soil with a rototiller.   If the organic matter is not thoroughly mixed into the garden soil it could interfere with water movement, creating pockets of wet organic matter and dry soil.  They can be planted in the garden in early spring around the time of the last frost or in late summer.Start the seeds either directly in the garden when temperatures are above 65 °F (18 °C) or indoors about one month before planting them outdoors.  A good mix contains one-third sphagnum peat moss, one-third soil and one-third course sand, perlite or vermiculite.Pour the potting mix into the flat, level it and moisten it with room-temperature water.  Do not cover them with soil as ornamental kale seeds require exposure to sunlight in order to germinate. Instead, press the seeds into the soil lightly with the palm of your hand.   Keep the soil evenly moist. The seeds will germinate in about ten days. Thin out the sprouts once they are a few inches tall, to one seedling per 3 to 4 inches. Keep only the sturdiest-looking plants.  Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth or organic mulch over the soil around the ornamental kale plants to help keep the soil moist and control weed growth.Thin them once they are a few inches tall, to one plant per 1 to 1 1/2 feet. Water them as often as necessary to keep the soil lightly moist but muddy.  Use a soaker hose or garden hose with a sprinkle-type nozzle to water them below the leaves in order to keep the leaves as dry as possible.   Water them in the morning so that any water that does get on the leaves will dry throughout the day. Give them 1 to 2 inches or 3 to 6 gallons (11.4 to 22.7 L) of water each time. The easiest way to measure how much water is being given with a soaker hose is to place a 1-inch deep can next to the plants. When the can is full, the plants have received about 1 inch of water. Too much water will cause ornamental kale leaves to turn yellow and drop.Not enough water will cause the leaves to wilt., Apply the fertilizer about three weeks after planting.Sprinkle about 1/4 pound of fertilizer per 25 square feet on the soil around the kale plants.Do not get fertilizer on the plants as it could burn the leaves. If fertilizer does get on the plants by accident, wash them off right away with clear water from the garden hose. Ornamental kale plants that do not get fertilizer will grow more slowly and may not develop their bright colors.  This will help wash the fertilizer down to the roots.  You should also harvest ornamental kale 70 to 80 days after the seeds are planted., Remove the outermost leaves first.   All of the leaves can be cut back to a height of 2 inches. The plants will grow new leaves in a week or two.  Ornamental kale leaves taste quite bitter.To reduce their bitterness, boil them twice using fresh water each time or boil them once and then cook them in olive oil.  Ornamental kale is not generally bothered by pests or diseases but caterpillars and aphids occasionally attack them., Caterpillars will munch on the kale’s leaves, leaving very distinct rounded holes on the leaves or half circles along the edges.Wear protective gloves when picking caterpillars. Some of them can inflict a painful sting.  The forceful spray of water will usually crush and kill them. Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that pierce the ornamental kale leaves with their mouths and suck out the juices.These little pests can be nearly any color but are often green or red. They also secrete a clear, sticky liquid called honeydew and can often be found on the undersides of the leaves.   Be sure to spray the undersides of the leaves to get rid of any hidden aphids. If the aphids return, spray them again. They may need to be sprayed every few days for a week or two to get severe infestations under control. Always spray ornamental kale in the morning so the leaves will dry quickly during the day.	Plant ornamental kale where it will be exposed to at least six hours of sunlight. Do not worry about frost. Use any soil type, as long as it drains quickly. Enrich the soil with organic matter before planting. Purchase ornamental kale seedlings at a local nursery or start them from seed at home. Plant seeds indoors in potting mix designed for seed germination. Spread the seeds over the soil at a rate of about 1 seed per inch. Plant seedlings in the garden 1 to 1 1/2 feet apart. Be sure to water ornamental kale when the top of the soil begins to dry. Use fertilizer that has a balanced 10-10-10 ratio. Water the plants thoroughly after spreading the fertilizer. Harvest the plants 55 days after the seedlings are transplanted into a garden. Use sharp scissors to cut the leaves when they are 8 to 10 inches tall. Be sure to harvest the leaves promptly or they will get tough. Don’t worry about your kale contracting diseases or attracting many pests. Pick off any caterpillars and drop them in a bucket of soapy water to drown them. Remove any aphids with a strong spray from a garden hose.
The hardest thing to remember about guitar stringing is that it starts from the bottom, not the top. Your thinnest string is the first string. It is almost always silver and "unwound," compared to the thick, coated strings further up the guitar.          This string is an E. It is sometimes known as the “high-E,” since the top string is a much lower sounding E note.; , The second string is the second thinnest string, one up from the bottom. It is a B.  The G is usually the last unwound string.  All of the notes here are for standard tuning, which is how guitars are strung in 90% of modern music. The numbers of the strings do not change based on tuning.  This is the second string from the top, and also the second thickest string. This is an A.  This is often known as the “low-E” as well, or sometimes the “bass string.” No matter what, know that it is the sixth string of the guitar.	Start numbering with the bottom, since the lowest, thinnest string is always your first string. Know the second string, the second from the bottom, is a B. Know the third string, the third from the bottom, is a G. Notice how, on many guitars, there are two “types” of strings – the thinner silver ones on the bottom, and thicker, wound strings on top. Know the fourth string, the third from the top, is a D. The fourth string, or the third from the top, is a D in standard tuning. Know that the fifth string, the second thickest, is an A. Know that the sixth string, the thickest string, is your E string.
Bermuda grass excels in sub-tropical climates such as the Southern US, South America, Australia, Africa, and India. If you live in a northern region or an area that's prone to high cold or reduced rainfall, consider using a different grass type.There are also more expensive Bermuda grass hybrids that are more resilient to cold.; , Rent or purchase a tilling machine online or at a hardware store. Roll the tiller over your lawn and lift up existing grass and weeds. This will allow you to plant your Bermuda grass without it having to compete with other grass or weeds in your yard.If you can't get a mechanical tiller machine, you can use a manual tiller to till the soil. If you have ryegrass in your lawn, you'll have to kill it off because it contains toxins that stop Bermuda grass from growing.You may have to till the soil more than once to remove any baby grass that starts to sprout after you till the yard initially.  Before you plant your Bermuda grass, you'll want to start with a fresh piece of land. After you've tilled the soil, you'll want to rake away dead grass and leaves so that you have a plot of land that doesn't have any new plant life growing out of the surface., Bermuda grass grows best in soil with a pH of 5.6-7. To evaluate the pH level in your soil, you can get a sample of it tested at your local university's cooperative extension. If your soil is too acidic, you must add lime to amend the soil. If the soil is too alkaline, then you can amend the soil with sulfur to increase the acidity in the soil., Bermuda grass does best in well-drained soil that's high in organic material. Clay soils are not good for the grass. Humus is the generic term used for soil that's high in organic material. You can purchase humus at a home and gardening store or online. You'll want to lay down at least 6 inches of humus before you plant your seeds or lay your sod.	Make sure that you live in the right climate. Till the area until it's free of weeds and patches of grass. Rake away the dead grass and weeds. Test the soil in your yard. Amend the soil.
Naturally tanned leather works best. For best results, look for vegetable-tanned or oak-tanned leather.Chrome-tanned leather is usually a bad choice. The surface is too water-resistant and too soft to hold a carved design. Light colored leather is easier to carve than dark leather, especially for beginners. The cuts and impressions you create will be more visible on light leather. It is also a good idea to use a piece of leather that is larger than your desired design. Carve the design in the center of your piece, then trim away any excess leather once you completely finish carving it.; , Use a moist sponge to wet both sides of the leather. The piece needs to slightly moist all the way through, but it should not be soaked.Alternatively, you can quickly dunk the leather in standing or running water, but you should only submerge it for a brief period of time. Leather that is too wet will become too soft to hold carvings. On the other hand, leather that is too dry can crack when you attempt to carve it. After the leather dries to its original color, it should be ready to work with. The surface should still feel somewhat moist and the leather should still feel flexible, however.  Use a pencil to draw your desired pattern on waterproof tracing paper or wax paper.   You can draw a freehand pattern or trace a pattern from another source. When using actual tracing paper, keep the matte side of the paper facing up.  Place the prepared pattern over your leather. Using a stylus, apply gentle pressure over each line of the pattern. Doing so should copy the design onto the leather.   Note that the traced side of the paper should face up when you position it over the leather. Tape the tracing paper over the leather to prevent it from shifting as you copy the design. Only tape the paper to the working surface or the back of the leather, though. Do not tape the tracing paper to the front of the leather. If you do not have a stylus, a ballpoint pen can also work. Make sure that you do not press hard enough to tear through the paper, however, since doing so would cause ink to get on the leather.  Once the leather has been cased and the design has been transferred, you should immediately begin to carve the piece.   Waiting will allow the leather to dry out too much. You can moisten it again if it does dry out, but doing so too often can make the leather more difficult to carve. If you do need to step away during the carving process, place the leather in a resealable plastic bag to help it retain moisture. Keeping moist leather sealed away for more than a few hours can cause mold to develop, though, so you should only do this if you plan on taking a short break. For longer breaks, it would still be better to allow the leather to dry, then moisten it again when you are ready to resume work.  Trace over each copied line of your pattern with a swivel knife. Each cut should be roughly half the thickness of the leather itself.Note that a standard crafting or utility blade can be used when a swivel knife is unavailable, but it will not produce uniform lines as easily as a swivel knife will. Cut the border first, when applicable. You can use a metal straight edge to guide the knife so that your border remains even. When carving the rest of your design, start with the foreground and work your way to the background. For lines that do not end at another line, gradually apply less pressure toward the end of the line to reduce the depth and appearance of the cut.  Use the beveler tool to round off any previously carved lines. While not strictly necessary, beveler tools should be used on nearly every leather carving.   Always hold the beveler at a straight, vertical angle. The deepest part of the wedge tip should be placed inside the cut. Bevel lines in the order you created them. Start with the border before progressing to the foreground of the main design. Gradually work from the foreground to the background. Lightly tap the back of the beveler with a mallet to smooth the edge of the line. Glide the beveler across the entire line, overlapping the previous stroke by about two-thirds of its full length, until the entire line is finished.  The camouflage tool, also called a "cams," produces a distinct texture. Using this tool is only optional but can add dimension to your finished design.   Position the tool over the portion of the design you wish to enhance. The tool can be angled vertically or tilted in any direction. Gently tap the back of the tool with a mallet to stamp the texture onto the leather. Do not use a metal hammer. Cams are often used along the lines of stems and scrolls within a broader design. In these instances, the tool is generally tilted toward the line. Cams are often used to add texture to flower petals, too.  The shader is another optional tool. Use it to make some areas of your design appear darker or more shaded than others.   Position the shader over the desired area. As a general rule, you should hold it vertically when shading large areas and tilt it toward the narrower end when shading a tightly enclosed area. Lightly tap on the shader with a mallet to contour the surface of the leather. Do not use a metal hammer. When you need to shade an area that is larger than the face of the shader, move the tool across the surface roughly 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) after each strike. Continue as needed until the entire area is shaded.  The veiner tool is typically used to add patterns to leaves, stems, and scrolls. Use the seeder tool if you want to create flower centers or decorative scroll ends.   Angle the veiner with the curve and space separate impressions evenly apart. Tilt the tool more severely as the space narrows. Hold the seeder vertically. When using the seeder to fill in a space, work around the perimeter of that space first, then gradually fill in the center. Both tools must be lightly tapped with a mallet to apply the design.  Consider applying a broad texture to background areas using a generic background tool.   Background areas usually include the gaps around enclosed shapes and designs. Position the tool in the proper place and strike it with a mallet. Work around the perimeter of the background first, then gradually walk the tool across the interior of the background, moving 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) at a time. Rotate the tool as you move it across the the background to make the overall texture appear more even.  Decorative cuts should be the last carvings you make in a design. These cuts can be used to accent the design once all other textures and alterations are in place.   Decorative cuts should be about half as deep as the primary cuts previously carved using the swivel knife. These cuts should also start deep and gradually get shallower as they move across the design. When making a decorative cut, carefully pull the knife toward you for optimal control. Each decorative cut must flow with the design instead of working against it.  Spoon-style modelers can be used to correct minor mistakes made with stamping tools.   Carefully run the spoon end of the tool over the misplaced stamp. Apply even, light pressure. Doing so should polish away the pattern, leaving smooth leather in its place. You can also use the modeler to further round away hard edges in your design. Too much smoothing can blur the lines of the design, however, so you must do this carefully if you choose to do it at all.	Choose the right type of leather. Case the leather. Create a pattern. Trace the pattern onto the leather. Carve immediately. Carve each line with a swivel knife. Round and raise areas with a beveler. Apply texture using a camouflage tool. Add dimension using the pear shader tool. Create finer details using veiner and seeder tools. Flatten background areas with a background tool. Switch back to a swivel knife when making decorative cuts. Correct mistakes using a modeling tool.
Making a faux fur pillow cover is even easier than making a faux fur pillow, but you will get the same effect. To make a faux fur pillow cover, you will need:Standard size pillow Enough faux fur fabric to cover the pillow and overlap slightly Pins Sewing machine  , Take the fabric and wrap it around the longest sides of your pillow. The fabric should overlap by a few inches in the back. Make sure that the raw edges of the overlapping fabric are both on the same side of the pillow. This will serve as the opening to your pillow case.The fabric should be fitted, but not too tight. If needed you can trim the fabric to better fit your pillow, but be careful. Make sure that you avoid cutting through any of the fur fibers as you cut.  Pin the fabric to hold it in place. Although you will be sewing along the short edges, pinning along the long edges or pinning the area where the fabric overlaps itself is a better strategy. This way you will be able to slide the fabric off the pillow before you sew., Remove the fabric from the pillow while keeping it in the overlapping position. Do not turn it inside out! The fur should remain facing in until you finish sewing.To sew your pillowcase, sew along the short edges of the faux fur fabric. You can use a simple straight stitch to do this. Sew across each edge two times to ensure that it is secured. Remove the pins after you finish sewing, or as needed to sew through the fabric.  After you finish sewing, turn the pillowcase right side out to reveal the furry side. Then, slip the pillow through the opening in the pillow case. Arrange the flaps to ensure that the pillow is completely covered by the fur pillow case.Place the pillow with the flap side facing down so that it is hidden.	Gather your materials. Wrap the faux fur around the pillow wrong side out. Pin the fabric along the edges. Sew along the short edges of the fabric. Turn the pillow cover inside out and insert the pillow.

It should probably stay under five pages, since you probably don't have enough time or money to afford a three hour epic. Keep it small. Scripts have particular formats, but you just need to separate dialogue (what characters say) from action.; , The hardest thing to get is a camera. Try asking your parents if they have one, and if you can use it. If they don't, move on to other family members, like aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. If they don't have one, try asking your friends. You're bound to find something.  Your cast can just be a couple of friends who like acting. Try asking around your school's drama club. Try to find your best friends for the crew, or people with lots of patience, because the crew, or the people who help out behind the camera, are usually stuck doing the mundane tasks, like holding the script, lugging equipment around everywhere and getting the actors water.  For props and costumes, look through your wardrobe, garage/attic, and friends' wardrobes. Try to shoot near your house, or in public property. It's harder to get people's permission for shooting by their house.  Don't try for the perfect take. Once things are as good as they'll get, move to the next location.  This is either the most tiring part or the most enjoyable, depending on what your film demands. Most computers nowadays come with editing software built in.

Invite everyone who helped make the movie over for a premiere screening. Send the movie to film competitions and festivals, and get it seen. If you can't do this then, assuming you have the cast's permission, release the film onto an online video sharing website.	Write a script. Get your equipment. Find your cast and crew. Find locations, props and costumes. Shoot the movie. Edit. Distribute. Once you're finished, make another movie if you want to.
Before you even begin to sing or practice breathing, place your hands on your back and abdomen, near waist-level. This will help you feel your body’s movement as you inhale and exhale deeply. You will feel your body expand as you breathe in and contract as you breathe out., As you inhale with a deep breath, visualize yourself filling the lower portion of your lungs with air. This will feel different from your normal breathing because our relaxed, daily breathing is usually quite shallow. As you breathe in, your hands on your back and abdoment should move outward.It may help to visualize yourself filling your stomach with air, as it if is a balloon.  As you exhale, try to exhale all of the air in your lungs, so that the next time you inhale, you will be starting with all new air. Imagine that your stomach is a balloon and you are deflating it. Your abdomen will contract at this point, moving your hands inward., As you breathe, do not allow your chest to move. Your chest and shoulders normally move up and down in your daily breathing, but when you are singing, you will want to always breathe from the deepest part of your lungs. When you are breathing from the lower part of your lungs (your diaphragm), your chest should very little, if at all.Focus on breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Breathing horizontally means that your diaphragm and abdoment should move outward instead of the usual up-and-down movement that accompanies shallower breathing.	Place one hand on your lower back and one on your abdomen. Inhale by filling your lower lungs with air. Exhale by allowing your stomach to contract. Do not move your chest.
If you are going to take the bus or train on a regular basis, do a trial run before you actually have to take it for real. Time the route out, pick up as many schedules that are related to the area of your destination as possible. Also, pick up a system wide map if available.; , Most buses do not have the ability to give change and asking the other riders for change is not the most efficient way to go about starting a trip. If your dollars are wrinkled, smooth them out as much as possible to ensure a smooth transaction at the fare box so that the people waiting behind you can enter the bus quickly. Whenever possible use "Golden Dollars" or Susan B. Anthony dollars. Be prepared.  Some operators (bus drivers) know some popular locations on their route but they are really looking to the passengers to know where they are going.  Each person is a traveler on their way to some destination. The bus may become crowded and patience is a handy thing to have. Short tempers do nothing but disrupt the progress of the bus and make the ride longer.  If you are sitting down, stand up as soon as you see the bus. If it is not the bus you want make a motion for the bus to keep going or step away from the curb or stop. The best way to communicate that you do not want the bus is to step behind the bus bench if available. If on the freeway, because of the high rate of speed and momentum of the bus, sit down as soon as you realize the bus is not the one you want and vice versa if it is the one you need.  Ring the bell as soon as you see the street or hear it announced by the operator or computer system.  That gives you an extra edge in making sure you get your stop.  He is concentrating on traffic and distractions cause unsafe conditions. After placing the fare in the fare box clear the area near the front door as quick as possible.	Plan ahead. Have plenty of change and one dollar bills. If you are not certain of your destination it helps the bus operator if you know the cross streets. Realize that the bus is a community. As soon as you identify the bus number that you want, start to wave at the operator to let him know that you do indeed want his bus. If you don't know the street name but recognize the general area, sit where you can see the streets. If your eyesight isn't that good or if you want to make sure to get your stop ask the operator to call your particular street. Do not talk to the operator too much about things not related to your destination.
Perhaps the easiest way to find someone to take over your lease is to go through a company that matches people with leases. For a fee, these companies will help buyers and sellers connect and act as a go-between which can assist in the process and vet potential buyers and sellers.Search online for car lease swap companies and look for customer testimonies and companies with positive feedback.Weigh up the costs of the fees with the value of the service being provided. If you need to find a buyer quite quickly, it could be worth it. Some lease swapping websites will enable you to search by make, model, and year.  An alternative to employing a lease swapping company is to list the lease online yourself, and deal with any interest you get from the advert. If you opt for this approach, you will have to do more of the work to find a buyer and negotiate a deal, but you will avoid the costs of employing someone else to do it. There will be listing and registration fees, so be sure you shop around to find the best deal with a reputable company.   The fees will vary but you should expect to pay around $200 to register with the listing site and place your listing. There will be optional extra costs that will boost the visibility and presence of your advert., The classified section of your local paper is a good place for an ad seeking potential drivers to assume your lease or take over your loan. Run an advert with a photograph of the vehicle, mileage, general condition, amount of monthly payment, and term remaining on the lease.   You can also use social media websites. If you use Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or any other social media site, post an ad on it. Be sure to include a photograph and the amount of the monthly payments, as well as the remaining term of the lease. Talk to friends, family, and co-workers. Let friends, family, and co-workers know that you are looking for someone to take over your loan or lease.	Contact a specialist company. List your lease online. Advertise it locally.
; ,, Use a screwdriver to take off the hinges as well.  You can purchase it at any hardware store or home improvement store.  Let it soften the finish for about 15 minutes. The stripper should cause it to gel.  Begin at the top of the cabinet and scrape downwards, allowing the finish to fall off the sides of the cabinet.   Repeat the chemical stripping and scraping on the exterior of all the cabinets you plan to restore.  Repeat the process on the exterior of the drawers as well.   Lay the cabinet doors across a sawhorse for the best access. Remember to wait 15 minutes after applying the chemical stripper to begin scraping. Scrape from the top to the bottom on the doors, the same way you did on the cabinets.  Your sanding motion should go parallel with the grain of the oak.   Continue sanding until there is a smooth feel to the wood. All of the finish should be gone, and there should be no grooves or differences in texture after the cabinet is sanded.  Remember to sand parallel with the grain of the wood, and continue sanding until the surface is smooth and consistent.  Dip a staining sponge into a can of oak stain and wipe it over the cabinets generously. As soon as you get the stain onto the cabinets, wipe it off with a dry cloth.   Stain and wipe the doors and drawers the same way you applied the stain to the cabinets. , This can often be found in an aerosol spray can for easy application.   Hold the can 8 inches (20 cm) away from the cabinet and spray evenly in one direction. Continue spraying the entire cabinet going in one direction and then the other (back and forth instead of one end to the other end) until it is covered with lacquer.  Spray it the same way you did the cabinets. , The lacquer should look less shiny and feel smooth when you touch it.  Spray everything the same way you did with the first coat. Let it dry for a full 24 hours. This will allow the finish to set.	Lay drop clothes under the cabinets and all over your work area. Put on rubber gloves, goggles and a mask that will let you breathe while protecting you from harmful chemical fumes.  , Remove the cabinet doors and drawers. Open a can of chemical stripper. Use a paintbrush to paint the exterior side of the cabinet with the stripper. Scrape off the gelled finish with a flat stick or scraper. Apply the stripper to the cabinet doors and scrape off the gelled finish, as you did with the outside of the cabinets. Sand the cabinets with 100-grit sandpaper. Sand the doors and drawers the same way you sanded the cabinets. Apply stain to the cabinets. Let the stain dry for at least 30 minutes.  , Apply a light coat of lacquer to the cabinets. Coat the doors and drawers with lacquer as well. Allow the lacquer to dry for at least 30 minutes.  , Fold a piece of 180-grit sandpaper twice and sand everything; the cabinets, the doors and the drawers. Apply another coat of lacquer. Re-hang the cabinet doors and install the drawers.
You're essentially crocheting a tube around the elastic hair band, so you can play with the size. Note that you'll need more yarn for larger scrunchies.   For a bunchier scrunchie, plan to make your tube longer. For a puffier scrunchie, you can extend the length of the chain stitch recommended here.; , Different types of yarn produce very different textures.   Fun fur yarn and chenille are playful choices for children and the young at heart. Mercerized cotton has a sleek effect for a more classic hair accessory. Choose ribbon yarn for a sporty style. Note that textured yarns are generally more difficult to work with than plain or smooth yarns.  Scrunchies can be obvious or subtle depending on the color and texture. Tones that contrast with the hair color stand out, while those that blend are less likely to draw attention to themselves.   Bright colors like pink, purple, or yellow are a cheerful choice, while darker colors like navy and black work better with more neutral or classic styles.  You can by a crochet needle, yarn, and knitting needle at a craft store or online.   Hair bands without the metal joiner tend to last longer than those that have them. You can purchase these at a drugstore or beauty supply store. Some craft stores may also carry them.  Do this about 6 inches (15 cm) from the end of the yarn.   Make a loop with the yarn. The free end (i.e., the end that does not lead to the ball of yarn) should pass behind the loop. Insert the crochet hook through the loop, hooking the free end. Pull the hooked yarn forward (towards you) through the loop and then upwards into the hook's working area.Hold the base of the slipknot with your forefinger and pull the free end to tighten. The loop should be firm but not too tight; it should easily slide back and forth along the hook. Check that you have 6 inches (15 cm) left on the free end.  Note that you might need to make this longer if you want a scrunchie with a wider tube.   Start your chain stitch with a yarn over (passing the yarn over from behind the hook). Use the hook end to draw this yarn through the loop on the yarn. Now you have your first chain stitch. Repeat this step nine to eleven more times.,   Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain next to the slipknot. Yarn over. Pull the yarn through both loops on the hook.You want the loop to go through the hair band so that you have two interlocked circles. This will be the "base round." Place a marker on the slip stitch to mark the end of this first round.  Push the hook through the stitch underneath, yarn over, and pull the new stitch through. Hold the base round horizontal with the three new stitches standing upright.    Push the crochet hook through the stitch. Yarn over twice. In other words, wrap the yarn around your hook twice before pushing the hook through the work. Push the hook through.  Work a slip stitch from your current stitch to the third chain stitch from Step 4 to form a round.  You will notice that you are making a tube that encases the hair band. The tube will follow the hair band around into a circle.  Your last round should reach the bottom of your base round without stretching. You may be tempted to cheat, but this will result in a scrunchie that looks small and flat rather than full and ruffled.   When you are done, it is time to join the two ends into a doughnut shape.  You're going to use this yarn to sew up the edges.   Thread a blunt knitting needle onto the end of the yarn and sew the two edges together. Make sure that the stitches on both rounds line up so that you get a smooth join. Tie a knot in the end of the yarn and break it off. Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) of yarn.  You can do this with the yarn needle or the hook.  Once you see how easy it is, you'll be making lots more!	Choose how voluminous you want the scrunchie. Decide on a texture. Pick a color. Buy your materials if you don't have them already. Make a slip stitch. Make a chain 10 to 12 chain stitches long. Pass one end of the chain through the hair band and slip stitch the two ends of the chain together to form a loop. Make 3 more chain stitches. Work a double crochet stitch (called a treble stitch in UK terminology - see Tips, below) into each of the remaining chain stitches on the base round. Join the round with a slip stitch. Repeat Step 3 ten to twenty times. Check the tube length. Break off the yarn, leaving about 15 inches (40 cm) of yarn from the hook. Pull the remaining thread into the inside of the scrunchie. Enjoy wearing your scrunchie, or wrap it up and give as a gift.
You have to plan what songs you are going to put in the demo. Will you create completely new songs? Put together old songs? A little bit of both? You also have to lay out your bio. What will you say? How long will it be?   Make sure to keep the bio short and sweet. Just a brief background of you (where you're from, your age, and what kind of music you perform). You also have to decide if it will be basement recorded or if you are going to pay the money on studio time.; , Good subjects to have are your age, where you're from, what kind of music you create and how long you have been rapping/singing. Make sure you include your contact information. You can include your phone number just in case but most labels won't have the enthusiasm to call you (unless of course they really like your music). It should be typed out, as it looks more professional than writing that isn't legible.  This is the most important part in the demo. Whether you record it all new or choose songs from the past, you have to pick songs that have a hard hitting beginning because it is unlikely the listener will keep the same song playing for more than one minute before he hits the 'next' button. You don't want songs that build up to a climax (those songs can be great for albums but not for a demo) you also need your best producer (it doesn't matter if you hate the guy, as long as you can work together and he makes dope beats ask him... If he wants money on the other hand, he better be more than dope) because a good beat ties everything together like a well oiled machine. Just because you want hard hitting beginnings that doesn't mean you must have all club records with a big bass and synthesizers. You can have a hard hitting track with a piano and a drum loop if it's done correctly. Just use various types of music and make it original. 5 to 8 tracks on the demo is a good number because if the listener sees a demo with 20 tracks, they'll throw it in the trash; any more than 8 is too much.  The listener doesn't want to hear 4 angry songs in a row then a sad song then 2 more angry songs. He wants to have a healthy balance so that's how you should arrange it.	Lay out exactly what you want and how you want it. Create a bio.The bio is what briefly introduces you to the reader and should tell him what he needs to know but also doesn't go too in depth; they'll be left wanting to know more. Have good songs for it. Arrange the tracks so there is variety. Get a box put your demo CD and your bio in it (make it neat) seal it, put the address on, ship it away and hope for the best response.
Cut off the bottom "stump" of the vegetable.; ,, Make sure to change the water when it is dirty or turns yellow. Plant the vegetable/plant in soil one day after it has grown roots. The entire base (stump) of the vegetable should be covered by soil, exposing the leaves and base where leaves sprout from.	Take a cabbage, lettuce, or leafy green from the store or your fridge if you have one. Fill a container with cold or cool water (not covering the plant) and place the vegetable in it.  , Place in a sunny windowsill.
Check your kitchen cabinets to see if they go all the way to the ceiling or if there is space above them. Empty space above cabinets causes energy to get stuck there and stagnate. You need to counteract this waste of energy by filling the space with lively positive energy.Bring life with leafy, green potted plants. Don’t crowd the space, but place enough to ensure the space is well balanced. Install lighting to drive away dark energy. Place beloved objects on the cabinets that create positive energy.  It’s a common problem to have a kitchen faucet that leaks, but you may not realize how this negatively affects your house’s feng shui. Water is the symbol for wealth, so a drippy faucet literally means that your wealth is slowly draining away. If you notice that your faucet is leaking, takes steps immediately to get it fixed.Check out this article for DIY faucet fixes. At the very least, if you can’t get the leak fixed, make sure the water drips into a pitcher or basin so it can still be used rather than going down the drain. You could use this to water the plants on top of the cabinets.  Because feng shui values open space and minimalism, it is important to sort through your cabinets (and pantries) on occasion to get rid of things that you are not using. Utensils, appliances, and food that are not being used are only collecting energy and wasting it. If you know you don’t use something very often, consider whether it is really necessary or not.Getting rid of old food frequently is important because your kitchen is the source of health in your home and old food does not promote good health.  If the kitchen represents health in your home, then the stove is the center of that health because it prepares your food. Keeping your stove clean keeps the energy of the food positive, but a dirty and grimy stove reduces the energy of the food which ultimately reduces your own energy.   Use all of the stove's burners regularly to maintain the overall strength of the stove’s energy. Move your trash can away from the stove to keep the negative energy of the garbage away from the positive energy of the fresh food you prepare on the stove. When you face the stove, you may be facing away from the entrance to your kitchen. Because of this, it is possible for someone to come up behind you without you knowing it. This is bad energy because it makes you restless and you can’t focus your attention on the food. To counteract this, hang a mirror over the stove to give yourself a view behind you.	Fill negative space above cabinets. Fix the leaky faucet. Clean out cabinets regularly. Show love to your stove.
Remove any surface dirt from the car's exterior by washing it using a non-drying soap and water. Dry it clean with soft cotton towels or by allowing it to air dry. By removing as much dirt from the surface as possible, you allow the chemicals in the pre-wax cleaner to get directly to the layer of wax instead of having to contend with layers of grime and gunk first.; , Strictly speaking, a spray on wax remover is a more legitimate pre-wax cleaner.   Spray on wax removers strip the wax off a car but do not do much else. They do not clean deep and do not remove contaminants that lurk below the surface. However, because they do not cleanse deeply, they make a good choice for someone who likes to frequently strip old wax and apply new wax. Non-abrasive polishes cleanse a little more deeply. They are used for less frequent strippings and clean dirt that settles beneath the surface of the paint. Their primary purpose is not to remove wax, but that is a secondary effect.  Apply the cleaner liberally, but make sure that you only get it on the paint of the car and not the plastic or rubber trim. If allowed to soak into plastic or rubber, wax removers have the tendency to discolor., Use a soft terry cloth to wipe the wax remover along the paint using side to side and top to bottom motions. Spread the wax remover using long, even strokes.  If your first application of wax remover did not remove all the wax, you may apply another coating. Avoid repeating this too often, however, since too many applications on unprotected paint can gradually start to damage the point.  Since plastic and rubber can become discolored when you use wax removers, a milder all-purpose car exterior cleanser is a better option. Apply the cleaner directly onto a clean terry cloth rag.  Apply light, even pressure along the trim to remove as much of the old wax as possible.	Start with a freshly washed and dried car. Choose the right pre-wax cleaner.Liquid pre-wax cleaners can be divided into two categories: spray on wax removers and non-abrasive polishes. Spray the wax remover directly on the surface of the car. Wipe the surface clean. Reapply as necessary. Apply all-purpose cleaner to the rag to clean the trim. Gently rub the surface of the trim.
If you are on the 3rd fret of the top string, a G, then the 4th fret is a G#. The 5th is then an A, and so on through the notes A-G#.

Write down the streets and intersection where you spotted the faulty street light. Determine exactly what's wrong with the light so that you can communicate that to the person taking down the report. Is the streetlight dimmed, completely out, or flickering? This information will allow them to repair the streetlight faster and more efficiently.   Using a notepad or your cell phone you can write, "Streetlight flickering, northeast corner of 7th and King."  , If you've been able to find the information on who handles street lights in your area, then you can give them a call to report it. Make sure to be polite but straightforward and give them as many details as you can.   For instance, you can say, "Hello how are you today? My name's James Smith and I'm calling to report a broken streetlight. It's at the northeast corner of Jackson and 5th and it doesn't light at all. I noticed it this morning." Some departments have operating hours, so check the website before you give them a call. If you get a machine you may have to leave a message. In this case report what's wrong with the light, where it is, and the time and date that you noticed that it was faulty., Some companies and government agencies will have an outage map that allows you to report a street light online, and others will have a form that you can fill out to report the faulty street light.Go through the automated process online and give as many details about the fault as you can.  Instead of having an online form, some municipalities or cities choose to use direct email. If this is the case, create an email and provide the location of the street light, what was wrong with it, when you saw it, and your contact information in case they need to contact you in the future.   The subject of your email can be something like, "Reporting a Faulty Street Light at 15th and Dickinson."	Be as specific as possible. Call the department that handles streetlights in your area. Report the street light outage online. Send an email to report the street light outage.
If the wood is unfinished, which means it is its original color, then you'll simply prepare the wood and add stain. If it is already stained you have a decision to make -- either stain over the old color or remove the stain and start over.   If there is a finish on the furniture (a clear coat that protects the wood), you must remove this before starting.  If you're adding a darker stain to a lighter piece, you can generally add this new stain over the old one without having to remove the original color.; , Stain can change the color of metal handles, knobs, and hinges permanently. They are best removed before beginning. If the metal cannot be removed then use painter's tape to carefully cover it all up.Plastic, glass, or rubber should be similarly removed to prevent accidental discoloration.  To get the most even and total coverage you should stain each part of the furniture individually. This prevents missing areas around joints or corners as well as stain pooling up along edges or in cracks. While not strictly necessary, this step will ensure the most professional finish., Work in the direction of the grains to avoid making scratches. This means that you sand parallel to the lines in the wood, not against them. If the piece is large you can use an orbital sander with 120 grit paper to work more quickly.   If the furniture is very worn, go at it with a coarser sandpaper (80 grit or so) until you have it nice and smooth. You can then move to the medium-grit paper. The lower the number on the sandpaper, the coarser (rougher) the grit.  Simply wipe off the wood dust as you work, making your sanding easier and more effective. A tack cloth is the best material, as it attracts the wood dust., Sanding opens up microscopic pores in the wood. The stain can then soak into these holes, changing its color permanently.   For very delicate pieces, work up to 220 grit slowly. Go from 150 to 180, then 200, then 220 or higher for a perfect surface. If the furniture is already stained and the color is still there after sanding, you will either need to continue sanding with a coarse-grit paper or use a chemical stripping agent to remove the old color   , This will bring out the wood's natural color, which will give you a better and richer color once the stain is applied. Simply use a clean rag or sponge to wipe the whole thing with the spirits, then wipe them off with another clean rag.  Even the easiest to stain wood -- oak -- could use a little wood conditioner for a better coat. Wood conditioner, which is easily applied with a paintbrush or clean sponge, should be left to dry for 10-15 minutes. It is essential for furniture made from:   Alder Aspen Birch Maple Pine Fraser Ceder, Right before you start staining, give everything a quick wipe to prevent any dust or dirt from being accidentally stained over.  If the piece is already stained dark black, for example, and you want a honey color, you'll likely be sanding all day just to get started. The alternative is a chemical stripper which, though messy, will remove the majority of coloring. To use one, purchase a stripper labeled "wash away" or "no cleanup," then move your furniture to a well-ventilated area:   Put on gloves and eye protection. Apply a thick coat of chemical stripper on the entirety of the wood. Let the stripper sit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use a putty knife to scrape away the stripper, working in the direction of the wood grain. Scrub away any last stripper with steel wool. Sand the furniture with a fine-grit paper (200 or higher) once it is dry.	Decide if you want to stain over the current color or start from scratch. Remove or cover up any non-wood hardware on the furniture. Breakdown larger furniture into smaller pieces if possible. Sand the whole piece with medium-grit (100-120) sandpaper. Use a clean cloth to wipe off the dust between sandings. Use a finer-grit sandpaper, around 220 grit, to smooth and polish the surface. Clean the wood with mineral spirits. Apply a wood conditioner for softer or difficult-to-stain woods. Wipe the entire piece clean to remove any last dust or wood conditioner. Consider a chemical stripper of you want to drastically change the furniture's color.
After your purslane is harvested, put it in a plastic bag and insert it into your refrigerator. This will keep the purslane good for about a week. Be sure to wash the plant before eating, especially if it has been foraged.  If a refrigerator is unavailable, store the purslane in a cooler bag or similar container. This will keep the purslane fresh for several days., Transfer harvested purslane to a colander. Rinse the plant under a stream of clean, cold water. Shake excess moisture from the cleaned purslane, pat it dry with paper towel or a clean dishcloth, and it’s ready to eat.While rinsing, use your clean hands to spread the leaves to ensure bugs and dirt have been removed.  When the purslane is clean and completely dry, put it in a freezer bag. Excess moisture may cause freezer burn or worsen the quality of purslane once it is thawed. Write the date on the bag, store it in your freezer, and use it within a year., Once your purslane is clean, remove the leaves from the stems and spread the leaves in a thin layer on a baking sheet. Set your oven to its lowest setting and insert the sheet. When the purslane becomes brittle, it's finished.  Keep a close eye on purslane while in the oven to prevent it from burning. Handle the hot baking sheet with an oven mitt or potholder when removing it from the oven. Dried purslane can be kept as whole leaves, crushed, or powdered. To crush or powder the leaves, pulse them on a low setting with a blender or food processor until the desired fineness is achieved. You can add purslane to smoothies or sprinkle it in with other recipes to add some extra nutritional value. Powdered purslane can also be used as a thickener.	Keep unwashed purslane in your refrigerator. Clean the purslane thoroughly before eating. Store cleaned purslane in a freezer for up to a year. Dry purslane and use it in smoothies.
Different types of orchids have very different care.   Phals usually have 3-6 very broad, somewhat floppy leaves that alternate. The flower spike comes from between these leaves. The flowers on phals can be any color, including white, pink, yellow, striped or splotched. Flowers are usually 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) in diameter and bloom on a spike that may be 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) in length. There may be more than one spike on a large plant and it may have anywhere from 3-20 flowers. If you aren't sure you have a phal, check the internet for images.; , This is the number one cause of death and you may not even know you are doing it until one day the plant is dead.   Phals are epiphytic plants, meaning in the wild they attach themselves by their roots to a tree or rock and get their nutrients from detritus that accumulate around their roots. This means that their roots aren't sitting in wet soil under natural conditions. Frequently, orchids from big box stores are either over watered or under watered. Over watered plants get root rot and eventually die b/c they can't absorb water. Under watered plants have hard, brittle roots. Healthy roots should be thick, a silvery green with bright green tips. It's a good idea to check the roots on a new phal when you bring it home. If all the roots are brown and squishy, trim them off and repot the plant. Keep it on the dry side until you see new roots forming. When you do water(typically once a week works well in most homes, but you should put your finger into the substrate to feel it before watering, if wet, hold off), allow water to run until it comes out of the holes in the pot. Do not get water on or in between the leaves, as this can cause rot, which can kill the plant. Generally, under watering is a lot less likely to kill a phal than over watering.  Proper potting of the orchid will help keep you from over watering!   During this time, you may want to keep the orchid in a more humid area, like a bathroom (as long as it gets some light). Phals can be potted in a variety of substances, but the most important is that the potting substrate allows the roots to get some air and drys relatively quickly. This means never, ever use potting soil for houseplants on phals. One of the easiest thing to use is a bark mix for orchids. To re-pot your plant, get a plastic or clay pot (plastic holds water better and you water less with one than clay-if you have tendency to over water, go with clay). Go with a pot size that fits the roots the best, not the leaves. Smaller is always better, as it dries faster. Position your flower in the middle of the pot and fill in the pot with the bark mix. As you fill, you should bang the pot against the floor to help settle the bark. It helps to soak the bark beforehand in water. Pots should always have holes in the bottom to allow good drainage. You can put a plastic pot with holes into a more decorative container if you want to and then just take it out when you water it. Orchids don't like to have wet feet! Not all roots may fit in the pot and that is normal  (Phals have aerial roots, you can mist them with a spray bottle when you water the plant).  Phals are a lower light orchid. They do not like to be in direct sun and this can burn their leaves easily.   Diffused light or early morning light in an east window works well. Overhead lights in your house are probably not enough though, so you should keep it near a window where it gets some natural, diffused light. Not enough light will keep the plant from re-flowering. If it's been 6 months since you've seen signs of a flower spike, try putting the plant in a little more light.  Phals do not like to get too cold. Temps at night shouldn't get below about 62 degrees. Daytime temps in the mid 70's to 80's are good.  Phals need plant food at some point.   Once a month diluted in water works well. You should use about half the recommended amount on the label and avoid food that use urea for the nitrogen, as it can burn the root tips. A 10/10/10 or 20/20/20 formula works well. There are several formulas especially for orchids, but they are all pretty much the same.  Starting with a healthy plant is easier than trying to revive one that wasn't cared for properly in the store. Look for a plant with big thick roots and nice shiny leaves that don't droop too much.	Identify that you have a Phalaenopsis orchid (Phals for short). Do not over water your phal!, Pot your orchid correctly. Do not put them in direct sunlight. Keep your plant warm. Don't forget to feed them. If your first flower doesn't make it, try again!

Look at both sides of the window, interior and exterior.   Make sure it is a window that is meant to be opened. Some new office and home windows are not meant to be opened. If there are no hinges or the window is a single pane with nowhere to slide, it likely does not open. Make sure that the window is not nailed or screwed shut for security or energy conservation reasons. Make sure any locks are disengaged. Look to see if the window frame has been recently painted. Decide which direction the window is supposed to open: up, outward or sideways.; , Removing dried paint that collected between the window and frame will free the window and allow it to be opened.Use a razor knife to cut along the edge of the window and the frame. Cut across all four sides of the window. You may need to check the exterior of the window in addition to the inside to make sure that it isn’t painted shut on both sides.  Wriggle the knife back and forth to loosen any dried paint between the window and the frame. Go around the entire edge of the window to loosen all sides., Use a wood block to cushion the blows from the hammer and prevent making dents in the wood of the window. Be careful to hit gently so as not to break the window. Hammer the wood portion of the window and not the glass.  Try to loosen the window one side at a time.   Push each corner to see if there is any movement. Press on the window gently to open it a little at a time.  Place a small block of wood on the window frame to give your pry bar more leverage. Gently force the window up with the pry bar.   Reposition the pry bar along the bottom edge of the window to lift both sides of the window. Using a pry bar may damage the wood of the window or window frame, use this method very carefully as a last resort.	Examine the window. Loosen any paint that is sealing the window shut. Insert a putty knife between the window and the frame. Hammer the edge of the window to break the seal created by paint. Push on the window with your hands. Force the window up with a pry bar.
Once the dough dries, you can have fun cracking the eggs open to “hatch” the toys. Small plastic dinosaurs can be found in many toy stores.  Make sure that the dry ingredients are thoroughly and evenly mixed. This will make the base for a dough.  Stir as you pour just a little bit at a time. The exact amount of water to add depends on the type of dirt you are using and the humidity in your area. In any case, stir in enough water that the dry ingredients stick together so that they can be formed into egg-shaped clumps.  Make sure to completely enclose each dinosaur. Using your hands, form the clump of dough into an egg shape.   You can dip your fingers in water and rub them over the eggs to smooth them out, if you want., Leave them in a safe, dry place while you wait.   Dry your eggs in the sun if it is warm in your area, but bring them in at night. Rotating your eggs occasionally can help them dry evenly. You can speed the drying process by placing the eggs in an oven set to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 4 hours, turning them every half hour. After the first hour, set the eggs on a rack on top of a baking sheet to help them dry more evenly., You can have fun by hiding the dinosaur eggs in your yard or a park, then letting children hunt for them and crack them open.	Gather small dinosaurs.You can create “hatching” dinosaur eggs by forming a non-edible dough around plastic dinosaur toys. Mix dry ingredients.Prepare to make your eggs by mixing together 2 ½ cups flour, 2 ½ cups dirt, 1 cup sand, and 1 ½ cups salt. Add water.Gradually add clean water to the dry ingredients. Enclose the plastic dinosaurs.Take each plastic dinosaur and wrap it in some of the dough. Let the eggs dry.It may take several days for your dinosaur eggs to dry hard to the touch, depending on how wet the dough was, and on how high the humidity in your area is. Crack the eggs.The thoroughly dry eggs can be cracked open using a hammer to “hatch” the dinosaur inside.
You can buy seeds, or you can opt to harvest seeds from an existing pepper. You want your mini pepper plants to be as strong and productive as possible. Thus, if you choose to get seeds from a pepper, you should take seeds from the kind of pepper you’d like to reproduce. Choose one that is fresh, healthy, and from a hardy plant.You can also buy mini pepper seeds online or at your local gardening store. Some store-bought mini peppers will be able to reproduce. However, some commercial produce is actually sterile and the seeds will not grow into fruit-bearing plants.; , Cut the pepper open with a sharp knife. Be careful as you cut, so as not to cut many of the seeds in half. Use a spoon or your fingers to take the seeds out of the pepper. Spread them out on a piece of paper towel.Once the seeds have been removed from the pepper, inspect them and remove any that are discolored or damaged. If the mini peppers you’re growing are hot, be careful. The seeds contain capsaicin, which is the chemical that gives peppers their heat. It can burn your skin, depending on how hot the pepper is. And it will definitely burn your eyes if you touch them after handling hot pepper seeds. Wear latex gloves if necessary.  This step is crucial to making sure your mini pepper seeds will grow. Moisture feeds fungus, which will render your seeds useless. Let the seeds dry out by putting them in either the sun or a dehydrator.You can dry the seeds on a piece of paper towel. It will soak up any moisture. Don't leave the seeds outside where they may get eaten by birds or other animals. When you think the seeds are dry, test them. Dry seeds should not be able to bend. They should snap in half went bent or when you bite down on them. If they bend or leave a dent, they still have moisture inside them.  If you plan to plant immediately, you won’t need to store your seeds. However, if you won’t be planting for a while, or you have more seeds than you need this year, you’ll want to store them for future use.Place seeds in air-tight containers such as ziploc bags or tupperware. Store them in a dark, dry place away from natural light. Don’t forget to label your seeds!  , Pepper plants can take a long time to germinate. Get ahead of the game by starting them indoors while it’s still cold outside. You can place your seeds in starter pots as early as 12 weeks before the final frost date.Seeds can be started in any small container with good drainage. Gardening supply stores sell starter pots in multi-packs. However, you can also use paper or plastic cups and poke holes through the bottom for draining extra water. Fill each cup or starter pot with potting soil or topsoil. Then, place the seeds in the soil, about ½” below the surface. You can plant anywhere between one and three seeds per container, depending on the size of the pot. Plant more seeds than the number of plants you hope to produce. You’ll select and thin your seedlings once they start to grow. Mini peppers are surprisingly hardy and don’t need special fertilizers or nutrient mixes to get started in most conditions.  Window sills are the ideal indoor spot for your seedlings. They offer plenty of natural light and can be warm areas in a house. Mini peppers do best in warm climates, so try to offer them as much sun and heat as you can while they germinate.Be patient. Mini peppers can take weeks to germinate. Keep your eye on them and make sure they’re getting as much sun as possible. Keep the seedlings safe from pets such as cats and dogs that might knock them over or dig at them.  Once your seeds have sprouted, a key to successfully growing many types of pepper is keeping them almost a little too dry. By putting a fan near your seedlings, you can help blow away excess moisture that leads to root rot and fungal infections.You can also put the seedlings near a vent, where the air is generally circulating.  It can be tempting to water your seedlings everyday, since you want to keep them growing. However, mini peppers actually do better when their soil is dry. Peppers grow well in arid climates, so there’s no need to overwater them. Over watering is an easy way to damage or even kill your mini pepper plants.A good gauge of when to water is to wait until your seedlings begin to wilt slightly. That’s when it’s time to water. A spray bottle can be a good way to keep soil moist without overwatering.  When the time to transplant comes, look at your seedlings and choose which ones you want to continue tending to. You likely have more seedlings than you have room for. Cut the smaller, less healthy looking seedlings to allow the healthier ones more space and access to nutrients.If you don’t want to kill the extra seedlings, you can transplant them into other starter pots and give them away to friends. It may be tempting to keep all of your mini pepper plants and space them very densely; however, this can lead to overcrowding, and your plants may not be healthy as they compete for light and water.  Keep an eye on your pepper plants as they continue growing indoors. When they have two sets of full, true leaves, they’re ready to be transplanted.You can transplant your mini peppers outdoors, or into larger indoor pots. Mini peppers can make great hanging plants either indoors or outdoors. If your mini pepper plants have gotten very big indoors but it’s still not warm enough to move them outside, you may need to move them into a larger pot while you wait for the weather outside to warm up. Place seedlings 14 inches apart to allow them plenty of space to grow, and access to nutrients.  Wherever you move your mini pepper plants to, be sure that the excess water can drain away from them. If you plant them in a pot, make sure it is porous and has holes at the bottom.If you plant them outside, make sure the water has somewhere to go so it doesn’t simply sit in the bed and stagnate.  Plant peppers in a spot where they can get lots of sun. Avoid putting them anywhere with lots of shade from other plants or buildings. If you’re keeping them inside, you may want to consider a growth lamp if you don’t have a particularly sunny spot for them.Don't over-water mini pepper plants. Let the soil become dry before you water them. Remember that they are used to very hot, arid climates. Planting mini peppers up against a brick or cement wall can be great because the wall will absorb and radiate heat from the sun, giving the peppers an extra boost of warmth.  Mini peppers of course won’t grow very large. When they seem to be the proper size (and color) pick them by cutting with a sharp knife or shears.Some mini peppers are ornamental, so you probably won’t want to pick them. Extremely hot peppers should be picked with caution or with gloves, so you don’t get burned.  About six weeks before you expect your first frost, cut back the tp branches and flowers of your plants. This causes the peppers that are already growing to mature more quickly, so they can ripen before the frost.	Choose a source for your seeds. Remove the seeds. Dry the seeds. Store the seeds. Plant seeds indoors and early. Place the seeds in a warm, sunny place. Turn a fan on the seedlings. Water the seedlings sparingly. Snip the weaker seedlings. Transplant mini peppers when they have two sets of leaves. Make sure there’s proper drainage. Ensure plenty of sun and water. Pick peppers when they are large enough. Extend your season by trimming your plants.
Turn the key to "on" without starting the care and listen for a "whirring" noise to occur. It should last for about two seconds and should be coming from the rear of the vehicle as the pump is in the gas tank.  The relay is in the inner passenger side fuse box. Turn the key to "on" without starting the care and listen for a click coming from the relay.,, Peel back the carpeting in the trunk on the driver side paneling behind the wheel well. There is a connector there with three wires: green, black, and grey. Use a multi-meter to probe the hot grey wire and touch a ground. Turn the car to "on" and you should see 12V for 2 seconds., Test for continuity between the ground contact on the fuel module and another ground (bare metal) on the car., You may also have a dirty and blocked fuel filter.	Listen for the fuel pump to run. Listen for the relay to switch.If the relay is not "clicking," try swapping it for the relay that controls the horn (if the horn is working). Test for voltage to the pump. Test the ground on the pump. If you have voltage to the pump and the ground is good, then you may have a faulty fuel pump.
You can use any type of soap you want, but something unscented and natural, such as pure-castile soap, would work best. This will give you more options for customization later on. Plan on using about 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.   Rebatch soap will have a grainy texture once cured. It will not be as smooth as a regular bar of soap. If you are using multiple scraps of soap, try to use the same fragrance, otherwise, you might end up with a not-so-nice fragrance. You can use different colors, but keep in mind that they may not always blend together to form a new color. Sometimes, they may appear as specks.; , The easiest way to do this would be with a grater, but you can also mince the soap with a knife. The smaller the pieces, the faster your soap will melt.  Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Set a heat-safe bowl on top; make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water. Pour the grated soap into the bowl.          If you have a crock pot, you can use that instead. You can also melt the soap directly in a saucepan without the bowl, but make sure that it's small so that the soap doesn't scorch., You will need 9 ounces (255 milliliters) of water per 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.This will help soften the soap up. Avoid adding too much liquid, however, or the soap won't dry properly.          If you want something extra-special, try tea or milk instead.You can also try goat's milk or buttermilk. If you are using freshly-made cold process soap, you may not have to use as much liquid, if any at all., Turn the stove on to medium-high heat and allow the water to come to a boil. Stir the soap every 5 minutes or so with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Make sure that you scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.         If you are using a crockpot, cover it with a lid and set it to high heat.You will still need to crack the lid open and stir it from time to time so that the soap does not burn. If you are heating the soap in a pot, heat it over low heat., Rebatch soap will never fully melt like melt-and-pour soap. Instead, it will turn into a grainy mixture, sort of like oatmeal or mashed potatoes. Be patient. This can take about 1 to 2 hours.         At some point, the soap will no longer change texture. If some time has passed, and the soap still looks the same, it's not going to melt any further.You are ready for the next step. If the soap starts to scorch, turn down the heat and add in a little cold water., You also don't have to add in all of the extras. Choose one or two (or three!) that appeal the most to you!  , Plan on using about ½-ounce (15 milliliters) per 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.If your soap is already scented, you might want to skip this step, or use a similar fragrance. For example, if your soap base is lavender scented, you could add in an extra drop of lavender oil.          You don't need to use as much essential oil as fragrance oil. This is because essential oil is much more potent. Do not use candle making fragrance oil. It is not skin safe. Another option for fragrance is through spices. This will also give your soap some color. Plan on using 1 to 2 tablespoons (7.5 to 15 grams) of spices, such as ground cinnamon., If you want your soap extra fancy, add in a few drops of nourishing oils, such as vitamin E oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, etc. Anything that you'd put on your skin is great for soap. Don't get too carried away here, however; too much oil can affect the curing process!          Another nourishing additive is honey. Not only will it make your soap smell nice and more moisturizing, but it will also give it a nice, golden color. Plan on using ¼ to ½ cup (90 to 175 grams) of honey., Because soap-making dye is translucent, this option is only recommended for white-colored soaps. Purchase some soap making dye online or from an arts and crafts store. Add in 1 to 2 drops, then stir it in. Keep stirring until no streaks remain. If the color is not deep enough for you, stir in another drop.          Soap making dye is very strong. Mix in 1 to 2 drops at a time until you get the color you want. You must use soap making dye. Do not substitute candle making dye, as it is not skin safe. Food coloring will not work either. You can add dye to brighten an existing color. For example, you can deepen a light blue soap base with blue dye.  This is great for those with dull or dry skin. The exfoliants gently buff away dry skin, leaving your skin feeling silky-smooth. Great choices include sea salt, oatmeal, and dried lavender buds. Here are the recommended amounts for every 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap:         ¾ to 1 cup (90 to 120 grams) of exfoliants, such as oatmeal, almond meal, coffee grounds, etc. 1 cup (50 grams) of low volatile oil content herbs, such as chamomile, calendula, and lavender. They can be fresh or dried. 1 to 2 tablespoons (1 to 2 grams) of high volatile oil content herbs, such as rosemary. They can be fresh or dried.  Purchase a plastic soap making mold. If your mold is plain and you want fancy soap, add in a rubber soap making stamp into the bottom, design-side-up. If you want to, lightly spray the inside of the mold with non-stick cooking spray. You can also rub a little bit of petroleum jelly into it.         You can purchase soap making molds and stamps online and in arts and crafts stores. Alternatively, you could use a silicone ice cube tray or baking mold.  Because of how thick this soap is, you won't be able to pour in. Instead, use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scoop the soap into its mold. Smooth the back of the mold down with the spoon or spatula.  Hold the soap mold about 6 to 12 inches (cc to cc centimeters) above the counter, then drop it. This will settle the soap in the mold and release any air bubbles.You may need to do this a few times.  Once the soap is dry, carefully pull it out of its mold. If you used a long, rectangular, soap making mold, you can cut the soap into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) thick slices.         If you are in a hurry, pop the soap into a freezer for 1 to 2 hours before de-molding it., Depending on the type of soap you used, your rebatch may still feel a little soft and gummy. In this case, set it down on a wire cooling rack, and let it air dry for 2 to 4 weeks.If you used store-bought soap, you may not need to do this, but if you used freshly-made cold or hot process soap, you most likely will.   Some types of rebatch soap (typically made from store-bought bases) only need to dry for 2 days.	Choose some soap. Grate or cut the soap into small pieces. Place the soap into a double boiler. Pour some water into the soap. Start heating the soap, stirring every 5 minutes or so. Continue cooking and stirring the soap until it softens. Allow the soap to cool down to 150 to 160°F (66 to 71°C).You do not have to add the extras from this section if you don't want to, but they can make your soap feel more luxurious. Stir in some fragrance oil or essential oil for a nicer scent. Mix in some nourishing oils for extra luxury. Add a few drops of soap making dye for color. Add some texture with botanicals and exfoliants. Prepare the mold. Scoop the soap into the mold. Drop the soap mold. Allow the soap to dry for 1 to 2 days before de-molding it. Allow the soap to cure, if necessary.
; , If you've got a stand for your music instrument, use it. Otherwise open your instrument's case so that your instrument is visible.    Adjust the height. Put the scores you have to rehearse on it. Put some pens on it.  So if you had music lessons or an external rehearsal, don't put your instrument away. Start instead with the preparation for your next rehearsal.	Adjust everything that you can start quickly and that everything is visible. Put your music instrument somewhere, where you see it several times a day although it doesn't disturb you. Prepare the stand. Procure that your rehearsal place keeps how you've adjusted it.
A genre is a specific category of music, such as bluegrass, rock 'n' roll, rap, etc. Often times people have wide musical tastes, and find it hard to pinpoint exactly what genre they love the most. However, there are some easy ways to at least narrow the list down to a few select genres. The easiest thing to do is to scroll through your iTunes library, or other music download library, and look where it says "genre" next to each song. Count how many times each appears to see what genre is most prevalent in your music library.Nowadays, genre has grown to include dates in which music came out. For example, 70's rock 'n' roll, or 50's pop. Your music library should also contain the date in which a song is released. See whether the majority of your songs are contained within a specific decade, year, or era. Write down 2-3 genres you wish to search for. Specific internet sites and/or radios organize random lists of music organized into all types of categories, including genre.; , Listen to some of your favorite songs. Pay special attention to the instruments used. A song might have a strong bass line (bass guitar), a guitar solo (electric/acoustic guitar), or maybe even a trumpet playing in the background. Whatever it may be, write down some of the instruments you particularly like. You might even want to go through your entire music download library to see what instruments occur the most.After you have your list complete, you can then type in specific instrument names such as "trombone," "piano," etc. into a music site search engine. This will pull up all the possible songs which use that instrument(s) in the song. You can even focus your search results more by grouping instruments you like together. For example, you can type in "piano, bass guitar, tuba" into the search engine. This will bring up songs with those three instruments only.  You can scroll through your music library and see how many times an artist appears. Write down two or three names and search for them online. If you have all of that artist's major hits, you add words like "rare" or "unreleased" to your search engine of choice to find songs by them you might not have previously heard.The great thing about focusing your search on a particular artist is that it opens you up to the possibility of finding other artists like them. Take for example that you are obsessed with the group Led Zeppelin. Type into your search engine "artists like Led Zeppelin" to find similar types of music.  These are often topics such as love, commitment, relationships, having fun, depression, sadness, loneliness, happiness, etc. You might wish to listen to love songs like you always do, or you might be having a down day, and wish to listen to a sad song. It is important to pay attention to the tone of certain songs as well. Searching for a song which "sounds happy" is different from a song which is lyrically happy.  You might be looking for music to listen too. For that, you need to focus your searches on music sharing sites, such as Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, etc. If you are instead, looking for sheet music to play, you will need to search other websites and sources. For sheet music, try http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/advanced-search or http://en.scorser.com/D/Sheet+music.html.You can search through sheet music based on lyrics, instruments used, and even notes.  If you only know a few lines, or even just a few words of a song, you can search for the song online. The most simple way of doing this is to type your lyrics into Google and see what search results pop up. You can also more specialized sites such as http://findmusicbylyrics.com/, http://www.lyricfinder.org/, and/or http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lyrster-lyric-search-engine/. These sites will limit the massive amounts of hits you would get by typing the lyrics into Google.Not only is this good for when you are trying to figure out the name of a song, but also when you are looking for certain types of songs. Take for example you were looking for a love song. Type in keywords into these site search bars such as "love," "heart," "baby," "romance," etc. You would then get lists of songs that have those particular words in the lyrics, and you can sample from that list some songs you might like. If you know a long refrain in the lyrics, and you wish to type it into one of the search bars, make sure to put parentheses on both ends of the lyrics. This will keep the particular search engine from searching for every word individually, and focus the site on finding the specific combination of words.  These are apps which you can download onto your mobile device, or computer to help you identify songs you don't now the name of. Shazam and MusicID are apps which are helpful when listening to the radio. Turn on either of the apps, place your device next to the radio as the song is playing, tag the song on the app, and your device will locate what the song title is. These can be downloaded on your Apple or PC app store. Note that Shazam and MusicID only work for prerecorded songs, not live performances.Another app which is helpful is Midomi. This app allows you to hum the song into the microphone on your mobile device. The app will then locate the name of the song for you. This is great for when you have that inevitable song stuck in your head, but you can't think of the name. Musipedia and/or MelodyCatcher allow you to play a virtual keyboard on your laptop. If you know how to play the keyboard, this is a great app for you. Simply play the song on the keyboard, and the app will track down what song it is. AudioTag is great if you have a short recording of the unknown song on your laptop or mobile device. Simply download the recording onto the app, and it will identify the song for you.  This, of course, is the easiest way to find good music. Randomly click on music videos that appear when you search for a song you know on Youtube. In the Apple music store, and other music sharing stores, there is usually a list of songs titled "You might also enjoy..." The cookies embedded in your computer tell the store what songs you typically buy, and then the store can give you advice as to some other songs you might enjoy.   You can also turn your iPod or mp3 player to "Shuffle." You might have thousands of songs on your mp3 player, and therefore haven't listened to some in ages. This will give you the opportunity to listen to some good music you haven't heard in a while.  This is a good way to get to know an artist's work, and have fun with your friends. If you don't like the artist's music, you can at least enjoy the time with your friends, and maybe meet new people. Try to go to local concerts put on by local bands where the tickets might be cheaper. You can still get a "feel" for a particular type of music, without having to pay a ton of money.   Experiment with different artists. For example, you might already know you love country music, but you might not know if you like Luke Bryan or Blake Shelton. Experiment with different genres. For example, you might already love rock 'n' roll, but aren't sure whether you like grunge.  This could be from a friend or a relative. See what types of music, or artists they listen too. They might be the same, or different, but it is always a musical opinion to consider when trying to find good music.   You can also head down to your local music shop, where CD's and records are sold. These are great cultural hubbubs where people who love music gather to talk about, and share their musical passions with others. The shopkeepers at these stores are also knowledgeable, and will be able to guide you in the right direction.  Youtube is an internet site which allows users, companies, and artists to upload videos and songs. Type into the search bar an artist's name, lyrics, genre, or a song title. If you know exactly what type of music you are looking for, simply search for it.If you are interested in a particular genre, type the genre name into the search bar. What will pop up is a multitude of "playlists." Click on one of these playlists, created by individual users, to listen a bunch of songs within the same genre. You can also subscribe to a user's account. First you will need to create your own Youtube account by clicking the button (looks like a person) in the upper right hand corner. Subscribe to an account to get more videos of the same nature by clicking the red "Subscribe" button below a particular music video. Every time that account uploads a new video, you will get a notification of it on your account. After you have seen a number of music videos cookies will embed onto your account. Every time you go to Youtube after that, your home screen will show both music videos you have visited, and music videos Youtube thinks you might enjoy. The latter group will give you the opportunity to explore different music that is still within a particular genre, song type, or artist.  Pandora is a website that is built around the concept of the radio. After you create an account, you can scroll through thousands upon thousands of "channels," each based on a different topic, such as genre, an artist's name, a song topic, etc. Type a word or two into the search bar to find exactly what you are looking for. As you listen to the songs on a particular channel, you can pause the song, or skip to the next song on the channel (allowed 5 skips per hour).Pandora is great to use if you are looking for music within a specific genre. Type the genre (bluegrass, rock 'n' roll, etc.) into the search bar and click on one of the channels. This will give you the opportunity to listen to a new genre you haven't listened to before, or new songs within a particular genre you might have never heard or new existed. For most songs on Pandora, the lyrics are provided below the name of the song. You can sing and follow along with a song if the words are hard to discern. Pandora also gives you the option to share a particular song on a social media site (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), or to buy the song and download it onto your computer's music library.  The Spotify app, found at https://www.spotify.com/us/, allows you to listen to almost any song ever recorded. Once you have the app downloaded, you can type in any artist name, song title, genre, etc. into the search bar at the upper left side of the app. You can click on "+ New Playlist" on the left side of the app to create a playlist. You can click, and drag songs onto the playlist so that they are always on hand.If you type in a particular artist name or genre, Spotify will produce hundreds, or even thousands of choices. When you click on one of them, Spotify will bring up the choice (genre, artist name, etc.), along with all the songs related to that choice. You can choose to listen to one of the songs, or all of them. Spotify is a continuous music player, meaning that Spotify will play the next song on the list after the first one is finished, or as you are searching for other music to listen too. You should also note that Spotify has advertisements after every five songs or so. You can also get Spotify as a mobile app so that you can listen to music all the time. Spotify also offers a radio feature, similar to Pandora, which can be clicked on, on the left side of the app.  iHeartRadio works a lot like Pandora, except it gathers signals from actual radio stations around the country, rather than user-made stations. You can use its service both on the iHeartRadio website, and/or the iHeartRadio mobile app (which you can easily download directly from their website). Choose from hundreds of radio stations from different cities, or different states.Some radio stations are geared towards genres like country or rap, while others focus on eras of music or the radio station's personal preferences. You may want to listen to a grunge station if you haven't ever heard that type of music before, or maybe hit up an alternative station to find music which you know you will love. The great thing about iHeartRadio is that you can switch back and forth between different stations at any time, even during commercial breaks.  Soundcloud is a very innovative service, and unlike most other music streaming sites. It does the normal functions of any music site, such as streaming thousands of songs, and allowing you to search through them by genre, artist, title, etc. However, it also provides users the ability to post DJ remixes, or songs they have been working on. The Soundcloud community also plays around with lots of already recorded songs, changing the way they sound to make even more interesting music (see https://soundcloud.com/kinoroy/u-smile-justin-bieber-800).Soundcloud is fairly easy to use. You can either use the homepage, and listen to music for free, or become a user and manage your own account. Similar to other music sites, you can create playlists, and/or subscribe to other peoples' channels. Another added benefit of Soundcloud is that mainstream music artists use the site to post songs they are currently working on, tracks which didn't make it onto their recent record, or independent singles they feel like releasing for free.

If you want to get to the front of the crowd for a certain band you love, you might have to see one or two of the bands in the line-up ahead of that band. You might be lucky enough to already know their music, but if you don't, it might be a good idea to research these artists and get to know their music. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it, if not, you make the decision to endure the music you may dislike. Even if you don't particularly like whichever band may be ahead, try to find a song that appeals to you by this band. This is a good idea to research the band because if not, you'll be standing in the middle of the crowd without a clue and when you may enjoy the atmosphere, you won't have as much fun as you could do if you listen to the music. It's always best to know the music.; , Take time to find a camp suitable to you. If you love the wild nightlife and don't care about not getting much sleep, it's best to be out in the open and where everyone seems to be. If you prefer a quiet campsite, try to find a closed off field. Some campsite sections are lucky to have their own small field. If you find one, try to find a good spot in a small field. This way, it'll have less people, therefore quieter and, whether you feel safe to, you have more of an option to leave all of your belongings in your tent whilst you head off into the middle of the crowd.  Of course, the obvious thing to bring is a tent. However, there are many things that would benefit you that you might not think to take. These are listed below in the "Things You'll Need" section.  A lot of the time, if you take a debit card, you can take out money at the festival (there should be ATM machines there) although you will, most likely get charged. If you want to take cash with you, make sure you find a place on your person to keep it safe. The first place you would most likely think to keep it is in your bra. Don't! You'll be jumping up and down and moving around so much in the crowd it will fall out and get lost. A tip for you girls is to buy a cheap padded bra you won't intend on wearing much. Cut a line across the inside of the cup and sew a zip onto the split material. You'll have made yourself a zip pocket. If you keep your money inside, with the pocket zipped, you'll keep your money safe throughout the festival. You're not likely to take off your bra the entire time. If you're a guy, try to find an alternative piece of clothing that's either padded or with double material so you can cut through one layer.  Music is only half of the enjoyment. If you make friends, you'll double your enjoyment. At festivals, the fun never stops but if you're on your own and don't make friends, it can be difficult to enjoy yourself. If you're shy, try to pluck up the courage to talk to people. Most of the people at festivals are often friendly, out to have a good time and you'll most likely find people talk to you at random. If you see and like the look of a few people enjoying a few beers at their camp, introduce yourself and ask if their having a good time. Before the festival, try to find someone who's also going and ask if you can camp along with them.  If you're on your own in an overwhelming crowd, and don't feel safe, get out. You won't enjoy the artists performing, you'll be concentrating on trying to breathe and feel comfortable. It takes a lot of effort to be at the front of the crowd, particularly for a highly popular band, and it can be very overwhelming. If you feel like you can't handle it, don't panic. Just make your way out and find a spot that feels right for you.  Festivals are one of the greatest forms of escapism. If you forget, you'll have the best time of your life. You most likely will forget instantly, there will be so much happening. Nothing matters on the outside; once you're in, that's all that matters. Enjoy yourself. Don't fuss if you haven't had a shower, don't be too bothered about having to pee outside and don't worry if you even get an ignorant hooligan deciding to throw a cup of urine in the crowd. In the end, you're messy anyway and you'll get nice and clean once you get home.	Research the music. Find a good campsite. Bring the right equipment. Keep your money safe. If you're alone, make friends. Make sure you feel safe. Forget about the outside world.
If you are planning to stargaze in a busy city parking lot, you aren’t likely to see much with any telescope. Light pollution will disrupt the image and make it difficult for you to focus on any celestial objects. Find a place away from street lights, and busy roadways to do your stargazing., Not all planets, stars, comets, or other celestial objects can be seen at all times of the year. Make a list of the celestial bodies that are visible in your location when you go stargazing. Also, make a note of where those bodies are in relation to one another. This will make it easier for you to find them.Some telescopes come with software that will locate specific bodies, but they can be difficult to set up and orient properly.  If you are a beginner, you should consider keeping your telescope design simple. Putting together a complicated instrument in the dark deters many people from using their telescopes. Alternatively, you could go out before sunset and set your telescope up, then wait for night time.	Plot out your stargazing locations. List any celestial bodies you want to see. Remember you’ll be setting the telescope up in the dark.
Re-clearance the rotation assembly - extra clearance in the bearings for additional crank flex, and open up the ring gaps for the additional heat of the turbocharger.; , For an old school 800hp setup - a pair of T04B V1/V2 compressors, P trim turbine with about a 1.2A/R is a good start. For a more modern setup, a pair of GT4094's would be a powerful combo with low RPM spool up.  A boost referenced FPR is a must. I would use either a Racepumps mechanical pump, Aeromotive, Holley Performance Products or similar. Blow through carb, fuel injection, will both work. CSU makes a nice Blowthrough carb setup.  Keep the timing low to avoid detonation. Tune it for whatever fuel you will be running most of the time. A wideband 02 monitor is a must.	Buy a 502 crate motor 8.75:1 compression ratio. Learn how to read a turbo map, decide what your horsepower goal is, and buy the correct turbos. Spend the money on your fuel system to keep up with the horsepower and boost levels. Tune it fat to start, and with low boost. Enjoy...
Attach the yarn to your hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation of ten chain stitches.   Check the "Tips" section if you need further instructions on making slip knots or chain stitches.  Work one single crochet into the second stitch from the hook, then work one more single crochet into the stitch after that. As you make these stitches, insert the hook under both loops of the chain.   You will need to continue working each new stitch into both loops for each one worked into your foundation chain. Make sure that there are still seven empty stitches of your foundation chain after you work these two stitches. See the "Tips" section for more information regarding the single crochet stitch.  Work one half double crochet stitch into both loops of the next chain. Work one double crochet stitch into both loops of the chain after that.   If you need help making half double crochets and double crochets, please see the "Tips" section.  Both of these double crochets should be worked into the same stitch. That stitch should be the next one along the chain.  To complete the rest of the side, you will need to repeat the same pattern of double crochets, half double crochets, and single crochets.   Do not repeat the two double crochets made in the previous step. In the next stitch, work one double crochet. Work one half double crochet into the stitch after that. Work one single crochet into each of the last two stitches of the foundation chain, completing the side.  Work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook.  You will need to make the exact same series stitches along the opposite side of your foundation chain to complete the second side. When making these stitches, you should work the hook under the single loops that still remain free along the bottom edge of the foundation chain.   Work one single crochet into each of the first two stitches. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch, and one double crochet into the stitch that after that. Work two double crochets into the following stitch. Make one double crochet into the next stitch, followed by one half double crochet in the stitch after that. Finish the second side by making one single crochet into each of the last two chains.  Slip stitch once into the beginning of the foundation chain. Doing so closes the end of the leaf.   See the "Tips" section if you need help with the slip stitch.  Work one slip stitch into the first stitch along your first side.   Insert the hook through both loops of the stitch as you work. You will need to do so to complete this initial slip stitch and all of the stitches that follow. This step starts the process of forming one "prickle" along the side of the leaf.  Single crochet once into the second stitch of the side, then work two chain stitches from the hook.   The last chain should be somewhat loose. If you make it too tight, the prickles along the edge of the leaf will bend and bunch up.  Slip stitch into the second chain from the hook, then single crochet once into the same stitch.   Insert the hook into the second chain and yarn over. Pull the yarn through the stitch, then through the chain on your hook. This process can be a challenging one, so take your time. This step completes the point of the first prickle and finishes the first prickle as a whole.  The rest of the prickles are made using the same basic steps used to create the first.   Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches. Make your second prickle in the stitch after that. Single crochet into that stitch, chain two, then slip stitch once into the second chain from the hook and single crochet once into the same chain. Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches, then repeat another prickle using the same technique. Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches, bringing your hook to the chain-one you made previously at the tip of the leaf. Use the same technique to make a prickle into that chain-one stitch. Work your way down the opposite side, creating three more prickles in the same exact way you created the prickles for your first side. Slip stitch into the last stitch at the base of the leaf to round off the bottom of the leaf.  Make four chain stitches off the base of the leaf. Slip stitch once into the second chain from the hook, then once more into each of the next two stitches.  Insert your hook into the base of the leaf, near the middle. Yarn over, then pull a loop through to the front of the leaf. Pull this loop through the chain on your hook, as well.   Insert your hook further up through the middle and repeat the stitch once more. Continue working your way up through the middle of the leaf in this manner until you reach the tip of the leaf. You should end up making about eight or nine of these stitches. Make sure that your stitches remain somewhat loose so that the leaf can still lie flat. You're working a center chain through the middle of the leaf during this step. This chain will give the appearance of a center vein.  Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull the tail from the back of the leaf to the front and through the loop on your hook to tie it off.   Use a yarn needle to weave the excess tail along the center back of the leaf, securing it in place. The completion of this step also completes your leaf.	Chain ten. Single crochet into the chain. Work a half double crochet and double crochet. Work two more double crochets. Reverse the pattern. Chain one. Repeat the pattern on the opposite side. Slip stitch the end closed. Slip stitch into the first outer stitch. Work one single crochet and chain two. Create the point. Repeat as needed, creating six more prickles. Chain a stem. Chain through the center. Fasten off the yarn.
This should always be the first step when taking on any plumbing project in your home.   Also have some rags and a bucket handy in case you need to clean up water quickly.  There are several different ways the spout could be connected, depending on how it is internally connected to the plumbing.   Look for set screws on the top or bottom of the spout.This will indicate that you have a slip-on spout. This type will slip off easily once the set screw is removed. If your spout doesn't have a set screw, then it is probably a screw-on style spout. Rotate the spout counterclockwise, being cautious and gentle but holding onto it firmly with a wrench if need be.  If it looks to be in good shape, with no rusting or cracks, then it does not need to be replaced. Measure how far it comes out of the wall. This will help you when buying your replacement faucet spout.  Make sure that whatever you buy will fit onto your existing plumbing or buy whatever fittings will make a new secure connection between your old plumbing and your new spout.   There are two basic kinds of spouts, one's with diverters and ones without.The diverter directs water to a shower head, instead of out the lower spout. If your old spout had a diverter, be sure that the one you buy has one as well.  Follow the manufacturer's directions, making sure that your connections are secure and sealed well.  If you have a leak, check that the connection points you just made are tight enough and try it out again.	Turn off the water supply to the bathtub faucet. Remove your bathtub spout from the wall. Inspect the condition of the pipe protruding from the wall. Bring your old spout to the hardware store to help you find a suitable replacement. Install your new spout. Turn back on the water and test to see if the spout works without leaking.
You certainly can try to grow one from a seed or pit, but that is much more time consuming and a bit more difficult. A peach seed will grow into a flowering peach tree in about 3 to 6 years; if you buy a peach tree at the nursery, aim for one about a year old – and the reward will be much more imminent.If you do end up purchasing a young tree, look for a dormant one with few to no leaves. These are best purchased between fall and early spring. If you try to plant an active tree with green leaves and full branches, it may put too much strain on the tree, and it is likelier that the tree will fail. As for using a peach seed, make sure it comes from a delicious, juicy peach, so your future peaches have the traits of “their mother” (although you should keep in mind that there is no guarantee that it will share these traits). When you find a tasty peach, set out the pit to dry for a few days. When it’s brittle, crack it open to reveal the seeds – they’ll look like almonds.; , Talk to your local nursery about what type of peach would grow the easiest. In the USA, peaches grow well in zones 5-9, but are best in zones 6 and 7. “Frost” and “Avalon Pride” are two varieties that can withstand a bit of cold weather.   And if you’re looking for a smaller variety that you can grow on your deck or patio in a pot, “Pix-Zee” and “Honey Babe” are good choices. They only reach about 6 feet (1.8 m) tall., The best time to plant a peach tree is in spring while the tree is still dormant. Do not try transplanting an active peach tree in summer as this may harm the tree. , Peaches love sun – at least six hours of direct sunlight each day is good. They also like it hot, so the warmest place in your garden (like next to a south-facing wall where it can receive plenty of reflected heat) is great.Look for a spot that has well-drained, sandy, moderately fertile soil, is elevated to give your tree proper airflow (and to reduce the risk of frost) and, as mentioned above, will also provide direct sunlight the majority of the year.  Thoroughly break up the soil with a garden tiller or garden spade. This amount of space makes it easy for the roots to spread out, helping the tree grow. What’s more, grass is greedy – making sure it’s not around the base of your tree will prevent it from inhibiting your tree’s growth.   Go 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep into the soil for the best support for the peach tree's roots. Spread the roots away from the base of the tree, but be careful not to bend them.  Mix it up well, loosening the soil. Then, water the area where you will be placing the peach tree. Just a bit more than a light sprinkle will do; you do not want to saturate the dirt.   If the pH of the soil is too low (you want the pH to be around 6.0-7.0), mix a few limes into the soil., Place the tree in your hole on a small mound of soil, and fill the hole back up. Pat the soil around the peach tree gently with a garden spade to secure it.   If you have a grafted tree, position the inside of the curve of the graft union away from the sun., Check your peach tree each day and water it lightly if it appears wilted. General rainfall is all a peach tree needs, but if you live in a particularly dry area, it may need a light watering.   Apart from this, to take care of weeds and nutrition, an organic mulch will likely do the trick. Just make a circle of mulch over the root zone that’s a couple of inches (5cm) deep and 3 feet (0.91 m) (1m) or so in diameter. With the right amount of rainfall, you can literally just sit back and watch your tree grow.  You may also want to consider deterring insect borers by wrapping the trunk with scraps of garden row cover.   To keep rodents at bay, you can surround the tree with a cylinder of mesh hardware cloth. Use a lime-sulfur spray to raise your tree’s chances against peach leaf curl, the most common disease culprit.  After six weeks or so, 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer spread evenly over the area will help your tree flourish.After the initial year, you can decrease the amount to ¾ of a pound.   After the third year when the tree is mature, add 1 pound of actual nitrogen to the soil. This is best done in the spring. To make your tree hardier, don’t fertilize it within 2 months of the first frost or when the fruits are maturing., You want it to take on an open center shape. After the first year and in the summer, cut the shoots that are forming on the top of the tree by two or three buds. In a month, check the tree for progress. If you have three wide-angled branches spaced equally apart, cut back other branches to keep these as your three main branches.   A year from then, again in summer, prune any shoots growing below these main branches. From then on, remove any shoots in the center of the tree to help it keep its shape. Prune the tree in late winter or early spring to shape the tree. Cut off any branches that are rubbing against others as well as any that might be growing up into the open center of the tree. Pruning annually encourages production, not diminishes it. It encourages new growth, allocating more resources to the parts of the tree you want growing. You'll get 10 to 18 inches of new growth each season., After the tree blooms, which will take about 4 to 6 weeks, thin the fruit by spacing them out 6 to 8 inches apart. This ensures that the fruit left over becomes large and juicy. You also want the sun to be able to reach all branches and fruit – if some fruit is flowering in the shade, thin it – that way you can allocate the nutrients to the fruits that will grow faster.   You always want an "open canopy" for your fruit. Try to have every branch have access to plenty of sunlight. Remove dead, dying, and crossing branches and blooms to give your fruit the best chance.  Watch the fruits on the top and outsides of the tree – they'll likely be ready for harvest first. When there are no longer any bits of green on the fruits, they're ready. They should come off with a slight twist.   Peaches are notorious for bruising easily, so be careful when you pick them. They can store in a resealable bag in the fridge for up to 5 days.Or, of course, you could make peach jam.	Purchase a young peach tree at a nursery or tree farm. If you live in a colder climate, select your peach variety carefully. Aim to plant your tree in spring. Select an area for planting a peach tree. Prepare a section of ground that is 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in diameter. Add peat moss and organic matter such as compost to the prepared soil. Plant your peach tree in the middle of the prepared soil. Care for your peach tree. Apply a mild pesticide to your peach tree after about a week to prevent insects and disease from damaging it. Add a nitrogen fertilizer about twice a year to your peach tree. Prune your tree. Thin the fruit. Harvest when the fruits are ripe and mature.
To make a simple and natural plastic-like substance from simple household ingredients you've probably already got in your kitchen, assemble the following:   1 cup of whole milk or heavy cream, fatter is better Vinegar or lemon juice Saucepan Strainer  , In the saucepan, heat the milk gently and bring it just to a simmer. Be very careful not to boil the milk, which will ruin the reaction.  Adding a few tablespoons at a time, stir in the vinegar with a spoon until the milk starts to separate into solids and liquids. This is basically the cheese-making process of separating and creating curds.  Remove from heat and pour the milk through the strainer when it's cool enough to handle. The rubbery and soft stuff in the strainer is the "milk plastic," called casein, an essential part of cheese-making.          By heating the milk and adding the vinegar, you started a chemical reaction that brought out the natural polymers of the milk, and made a natural plastic-like compound.  See how your plastic stuff reacts when pinched, stretched, or dropped. If you let it sit for a while, or put it in the freezer, it will get hard.          You could also pour it into candy molds or other shapes and allow it to harden in a fun shape. If you haven't painted it already, paint it to make holiday ornaments or natural jewelry as a fun project for kids. The plastic will be good for a few days, but has the basic shelf-life of food. Throw it away before it molds.	Assemble the right ingredients. Heat the milk. Add the vinegar. Strain the mixture. Harden the plastic by freezing.
When choosing the flowers, only choose those in good condition and without blemishes or deterioration. Glycerin preserves but does not fix the appearance of flowers.; , This increases the surface area to allow the water uptake to be plentiful.  If left on, these will turn murky in the water and begin to rot, which will hasten the deterioration process (and it smells bad). They're not needed, so remove them.  Peel off around 6 centimeter (2.4 in) of the stem. This helps the glycerin to access each flower stem with ease, and ensures better take-up of the solution.  Stir to combine.  in which the flowers will stand.  Ensure that the flowers have air circulation between them; in other words, don't push them in too tightly.  In some cases, the flowers will dry out and still look good, thanks to the glycerin; you can keep these dried flowers for dried floral arrangements if you like.	Pick or purchase the flowers intended for display. Cut the flower stems diagonally across their bottoms. Remove the bottom leaves from the stems. Peel the skin from the base of the stem. Add 1 part glycerin to 2 parts water in a small bowl. Pour the solution into the container (vase, bowl, etc.), Arrange the prepared flowers in the solution. Enjoy longer-lasting flowers.
Common kinds of clay include polymer clay (often called oven-hardening clay), self-hardening clay and fine art clay. Since the type of clay has an equally powerful effect on how you build your model, this is something you're better off knowing before you begin your projects.          Polymer clay does not technically contain clay. Instead, it has polymers similar to PVC, with liquids added to make it moldable. It hardens usually in an oven over low heat. Self-hardening clay is exactly what it sounds like. You mold it, set it aside, and let it harden over the course of several days. Unlike modeling clays, which are oil- or wax-based, and polymer clays, which are resinous, self-hardening clays are water-based. Fine art clays are usually exactly like self-hardening clays, except that they use high-quality clay and add only water.; , Some pigments are applied after the clay hardens or in the middle of the hardening process.          It's important to understand these aspects of any coloration prior to starting your project.  Set a piece of wax paper on top of a baking sheet, cutting it so that it matches the inside dimensions of the sheet.          Most polymer or oven-based clays will harden after they are cooked at 265 °F (129 °C) to 275 °F (135 °C) for 15 minutes per 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) of thickness. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and place it on a heat-resistant surface. Allow the clay items to cool at room temperature before removing.  Keep it out of the way and trust time to do its work.          Set the finished model on wax paper on a baking sheet or similar flat and stable surface. Place the sheet someplace dry, at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. For best results, set it out of the way of other activities. The top of a refrigerator is a good example.Wait 7 to 10 days for the clay to dry completely.  You can find these facilities at local art stores, community colleges and community centers. If you're not already intimately familiar with how to kiln-harden clay, let the people who run the kiln fire your model.	Identify the kind of clay with which you're working. Apply any pigments or glazes appropriate for painting on prior to hardening the clay. Bake polymer clay and oven-hardening clay in a regular kitchen oven. Use patience when waiting for self-hardening clay to harden. Schedule time in a professional kiln to harden fine art clay.
Spray the cardboard with some spray-on adhesive and cover it with a piece of colorful fabric. Trim off the excess fabric and turn the panel over so that the back/undecorated side is facing you. Place a square of double-sided foam tape on each corner.Pop each panel into the spaces between the shelves. Press down on the corners to make the tape stick.   You can also use drawer liner, wallpaper, or even wrapping paper. The drawer liner does not need to be glued onto the cardboard, as it already is sticky on the back.  Choose a ribbon that is the same width as the edges of your shelves. Cut the ribbon so that it is the same length as the shelf. Apply some double-sided tape along the edges of your bookshelf where you want the ribbon to be. Press the ribbon down onto the tape.You can also use scrapbooking tape. It comes in many different colors and patterns. Stick the end of the tape onto one of the ends of the shelf, and roll it across the edge. When you get to the other end of the shelf, snip the tape off.  You can secure them by taping the rope part to the top corners of the bookshelf. You can also drill a tiny hole into each top corner of the bookshelf and twist in a small cup-hook; the garland or lights can drape over this.   You can purchase flower garlands and battery-operated string lights at an arts and crafts store. Most flower garlands are between six and eight feet long. You can trim them down to the width of your bookshelf using a pair of wire cutters, or you can leave the garland as it is; the ends will drape against the sides of your bookshelf.  Purchase a set of battery-operated shelving or cabinet lights and some double-sided foam mounting tape. Peel the tape off the card and stick it to the back of the light; try to get it as centered as possible. Peel the backing off, and then press the light to the underside of the shelf.	Add some decorative panels to the back of your bookshelf.Measure the spaces between the shelves of your bookcase, and cut pieces of cardboard or foamboard to fit using a craft knife. Use ribbon to trim the edges of your bookshelf. Drape a flower garland or battery-operated string lights over the top of the bookshelf. Add some lights to the inside of the bookshelf.
Flooding information can be found on your local news or weather station’s TV channel or website. Tune in to monitor changes in the weather. Also, listen to local radio stations for periodic updates.A flood watch means that flooding may happen in your area. A flood warning means flooding is happening or will occur soon.  Keep an eye on dangerous areas such as drainage channels, canyons, and streams. These tend to overflow quickly in flash floods and are very dangerous. Stay far away from them and recognize any that are near you. They may cause flooding before there are any news reports., If you are evacuated, don’t attempt to go home until the authorities say it’s safe to do so. Floodwaters can persist for some time even after the immediate threat is gone. In addition, listen for the authorities to say that water from the community water supply is safe to drink.Stay tuned to news sources on the radio, TV, and online.	Listen to the news for flood risk warnings. Watch known flood areas. Listen to the authorities for directions.
It is usually found in spools online. A 200-foot (60.96-meter) spool will give your three medium-sized baskets.Because it is hard to join two pieces of rope together, it is better to have too much rope than not enough.  Fold the end of the rope under itself, then roll it in a spiral to form a small disk that is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) across. This will create the foundation of your basket., Choose the largest stitch length possible on your sewing machine, then set the stitch to a zigzag. Sew straight across the disk, rotate it 90 degrees, then sew back across it, forming an X., Turn the disk so that the rest of the of the rope is in front of the sewing machine. Hold the rope against the side of the disk, then slide the disk under the presser foot. Make sure that the center of the foot is in the groove between the two coils.You can use a thread color that matches your rope, or you can use a contrasting color to make it look more interesting.  The needle should be going back and forth across the groove, catching onto both coils of rope. This is what will hold the basket together. Keep going until the basket is the width you want it to be.   Avoid making your basket too wide using this method. The wider it is, the more difficult it will be to sew. Something around 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) across would be ideal., Grab hold of the disk, and turn it so that it is resting vertically against the side of the sewing machine. Continue sewing your way across the coils, using the same zigzag stitch as before, until your basket it the height you want it to be.Consider changing the color of your thread every couple of rows for an interesting, banded effect.At this point, your basket is just about complete. You can click here to learn how to finish your basket, or you can keep reading to learn how to add handles.  When your basket is the height you want it to be, stop sewing, and backstitch back and forth a few times. Cut the thread and tie it off. Tug the rope up to loosen it and create a loop. Move forward a few inches/centimeters, and start sewing again; remember to backstitch a few times before you continue sewing around the basket.Make sure that the loop you make is big enough for you to slip your hand through.  Keep sewing your basket as you did previously until you are directly across from the first handle. Backstitch a few times, then cut and tie the thread. Pull the rope up, move forward a few inches, and start sewing again. Once again, backstitch a few times at your new starting point.   When you get to the start of the first handle, you can choose to finish your basket. You can also keep sewing across the handles for 1 to 2 more rows to make them thicker and stronger.  Cut the rope down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Tuck it into the basket, and backstitch across it a few times. Cut the thread off, and tie it into a tight knot.	Get some 7/32-inch (0.56-centimeter) thick 100% cotton clothesline. Twist the end of the rope to form a coin-sized disk. Stitch across the top of the disk using your sewing machine to form an X. Orient your work properly. Start sewing, turning the disk counterclockwise as you feed the rope towards the presser foot. Turn the disk so that it is perpendicular to the sewing machine, and start building up the sides of the basket. Start shaping the first handle. Add the second handle. Finish the basket.
Container gardens dry out much quicker than ground gardens. The best times to water are early morning (the moisture will serve the plants all day) and early evening (the moisture will help the plants recover from a day of sunlight and heat.)  ,,, Container gardens, including those planted in dresser drawers, have the benefit of being mobile. If you have a wagon, place the drawer on the wagon and move it throughout the day to get the most sun exposure.  This will help to produce the best possible flavors.        The jalapeño peppers are 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in length and somewhere between a dark green and a bright red (bright red spots mean the pepper is ripening further, which is perfectly ok.)       The shoots on the onions and garlic are beginning to turn yellow and dry out. Note: This is not required - both can be harvested while shoots are still green and fresh-looking.	Water daily, sometimes twice daily. Apply mulch around plants to protect your plants from the heat and help retain crucial moisture.  , If possible, raise the drawer off of the concrete by placing it on a pallet, or stuffing pieces of wood underneath the drawer to create air flow.  , Make sure your garden's location will allow a minimum of 8-10 hours of sunlight each day. Allow the tomatoes and peppers to ripen completely on the vine. Harvest all the vegetables to make salsa when:  The tomatoes are full grown and bright red. You're now ready to make fresh garden salsa using your favorite salsa recipe!
Creating a parallel circuit is an excellent and easy experiment for students learning about electricity. This method of building a parallel circuit is excellent for younger students: they may have limited dexterity, and you may not want them to use sharp tools.   If you are making a parallel circuit as part of a lesson plan, it may help to have your students or child make a list of questions, predictions, and hypotheses about what they'll be observing.; , The cheapest and most convenient power source for your parallel circuit project is a battery. A 9-volt battery is an excellent choice.  This is the item that you'll be hooking up to the power source. We'll describe making a parallel circuit with lightbulbs (you'll need two); flashlight bulbs are also a good choice.  You are using aluminum foil as your conductor in this method of building a parallel circuit. The foil will be used to connect the power source to the loads.   Cut the foil into four narrow strips: two 8" pieces, and two 4" pieces. They should be narrow, about the width of a drinking straw.  You're now ready to start hooking up your parallel circuit.   Take one of the 8" strips of foil and connect it to the positive terminal of the battery. Take the other 8" strip and connect it to the negative terminal of the battery. , You're now ready to connect your loads to the conducting material.   Take the two shorter, 4" strips and wrap one end of each around the long strip coming off the positive terminal. (Place one 4" strip near the top of the strip, and the other about three inches down towards the battery.)Wrap the loose ends of the shorter strips around your two lightbulbs. You may find it helpful to secure the strips with electrical tape.  Once you finish connecting all of the elements of the parallel circuit, your lightbulbs should glow.   Place the ends of the two lightbulbs against the 8" strip of foil that is attached to the negative terminal of the battery. The lightbulbs should now shine brightly!	Consider the age and skill of those involved. Choose your power source. Choose your load. Prepare your conductors. Connect the first of the conducting strips to the battery. Hook up your lightbulbs. Complete the parallel circuit.
Make sure to buy a kit that tests for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and pH level. Mix in water, soil, and your reactive agent per the instructions on the kit, and see if the topsoil you plan on buying has adequate levels for what you are trying to grow. Nitrogen promotes plant growth and produces chlorophyll, Phosphorus promotes root, fruit, flower, and seed production, and potassium regulates water intake and the movement of sugars within a plant.Different plants and vegetables require different nutrients. Base your levels of nutrients on your plant types. It should give you descriptions for appropriate nutrient and mineral levels in the instructions of your test. Sometimes take-home soil test kits are not totally accurate so make sure to read reviews on the brand you are buying., Cooperative extensions exist all over the country to help aspiring farmers or gardeners promote the growth of their crops and gardens.Taking your soil to these professionals will provide you with the most accurate results on the nutrient and mineral makeup of your topsoil.   Cooperative extensions can also provide you with expert knowledge on how to improve growing your crops. They may also direct you to topsoil retailers and distributors that may help reduce your costs.  If you don’t want to mess around with chemical and nutrient compositions, a more traditional approach may work for you. Get a sample of the soil before purchasing it in bulk and try to plant whatever intended seeds you’d like to grow. It will take more time, but will allow you to see what kind of topsoil you would be purchasing and if it fits your needs.   Different plants require different minerals and nutrients so make sure to remember to plant a variety of seeds. You can use a couple of samples of topsoil simultaneously so that you can choose the best one.	Buy a soil test kit at a hardware store to determine its chemical composition. Take a sample of soil to an cooperative extension for testing. Try planting different kinds of seeds in the soil to see if they grow.
Lay your quilt batting on a flat surface. Measure, mark, and cut the quilt batting so that each edge is 1 inch (2.54 cm) longer than the corresponding dimensions of the canvas. You will pull this extra material up and around the wooden frame., Place your canvas face down in the center of the quilt batting. Pull one edge of the material up and over the wooden frame—make sure it is pulled tight. Use a staple to gun to insert staples along the entire edge of the frame. Repeat on the three remaining sides., Run a warm iron over your fabric to remove any creases or wrinkles. Lay your pressed fabric on a flat work space. Measure, mark, and cut the fabric so that each edge is 1 inch (2.54 cm) longer than the corresponding dimensions of the canvas., Lay your fabric wrong side up on a flat work space. Place your canvas face down in the center of the fabric. Pull one edge of the fabric up and over the wooden frame. Insert a line of staples down the entire edge of the frame. Repeat on the three remaining sides., Run the ribbon diagonally across the canvas from the top left corner to the bottom right corner—pull the ribbons tight. Staple the ends of the ribbon to the back of the wooden frame. Run a second length of ribbon diagonally from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. Staple the ends of the ribbon to the back of the wooden frame. The two lengths of ribbons will form a “X”., Using the “X” as a guide, add additional ribbons to your board. Each ribbon should run diagonally from right-to-left or from left-to-right. Use a ruler to make sure the ribbons are spaced evenly.   Don't forget to pull the ribbons tight., To prevent the ribbons from moving, sew a button at each point where the ribbons cross. Flip the canvas over. You will see a knot of thread where you attached a button. To prevent these knots for slipping, place a dab of hot glue onto each knot. This will prevent the knots from unraveling. Once the hot glue is dry, you can start adding memories to your board.	Cut the quilt batting. Attach the quilt batting to the canvas. Iron and cut the fabric. Attach the fabric to the canvas. Create a “X” out of ribbons. Add more ribbons as desired. Sew on buttons where the ribbons cross.
You should see numerous lights turn on in the dash.; , In some cases, such as a low fuel warning light, you may need to press the 'BC' button on the end of the indicator stalk once to remove them.  An exclamation mark will appear in the screen in middle of the speedometer, but keep holding down the button until the next picture appears- then let go.  When you arrive at the service that you wish to reset press and hold the black button until the text 'Reset?' is visible under the picture, then let go. Finally press and hold the button again to confirm the reset.  This is done similarly by pressing singularly to scroll though the numbers and a long press to confirm your selection. Also I have had instances where statutory inspections will not reset. In Australia neither of these services are required and they can be removed at any BMW dealership, if you can't reset them manually you'll have to visit the dealer.	Insert your remote key into the key slot and press the 'Start Stop' button once without putting your foot on the brake. Wait for any warning lights to go out. Press and hold the black button, which is located on the bottom left of the speedometer (instrument cluster). To cycle through one by one all of the picture options for each service press the black button once. Two service options which may be visible on your dash require resetting to a future date (statutory vehicle inspection and statutory exhaust gas inspection).
This will eventually make the top part of your hat.Top hats taper, meaning they are wider at the top and narrower towards the brim. Don't worry about matching the colors; you can always paint the hat at the very end!   Consider trimming the rolled rim of your cup off first. This way, you won't get a bulky seam where the hat and top join.  Draw a line of hot glue around the top rim of the cup, then quickly push the circle down onto it. For a neater touch, draw the glue just inside the rim; this way, you won't have to worry about the glue leaking out from under the circle.   If you'd like a fancier hat, cover both the cup and the circle with fabric first. You can use any type of fabric you like, but stretchy fabric will make it easier. Tuck any raw edges inside the cup or under the circle.  Most paper cups are too tall to be a top hat, even a stylized, mini, "Mad Hatter's" top hat. To make it more realistic, cut the bottom portion of the cup off. For example, if you are using a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup, an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) off the bottom will be plenty.For a more authentic look, cut the bottom of the cup at a curve on both sides so that it dips slightly towards the front and back.  You can use a compass or a plate to do this. Keep the brim proportionate to the cup. A 5½ to 6 inches (13.97 to 15.24 centimeters) will work great for a 12-ounce (350 milliliters) cup., If you'd like, you can cut the center of the brim out too; this will help the hat sit better on your head. Use the bottom of your hat (the cut part of the cup) to trace the circle, then cut it out just a little bit smaller; this will make it easier to glue the hat together. For a fancier hat, you can cover the brim with fabric as well.  Draw a line of hot glue around the base of the hat, then quickly press the brim down onto it. If you cut the base of the cup at a curve, make sure that the brim follows the curve; you don't want any gaps. Hold the brim in place until the glue sets; this should only take a few seconds.  This will blend everything together, and make it look more like a hat, and less like a combination of paper cups and cardstock. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. Let the hat dry before continuing.   If you covered your hat with fabric, then you do not need to paint it.  Secure the band with some fabric glue. Measure around the base of the hat, just above the brim, then add ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Cut a piece of ribbon to that length, then wrap it around the base of the hat. Overlap the ends, and secure them with glue.   For a for finished look, tuck the raw edge of the ribbon under before you glue it down. For a fancier gothic hat, cut a long, narrow strip of tulle or spiderweb lace, and wrap it around the base of the hat. Tie the tulle/lace in a bow or knot.  A Mad Hatter's top hat is not complete without any added decorations. You can hot glue all sorts of odd things to the hat band. To keep your hat from looking too wild, keep all your decorations to one spot, preferably on the side. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Mini feathers Fancy beads Fancy coat buttons Old watch gears Hat pins  , For a more chic look, glue the hat at a slight angle on the headband; this way, it will rest on your head at an angle instead of right on top.	Trace the top of a paper cup onto a sheet of cardstock, then cut the circle out. Glue the circle to the top of the cup. Trim the bottom part of the cup off so that the hat is more proportionate. Trace a circle onto a sheet of cardstock to make the brim. Cut the brim out. Glue the hat to the brim. Paint the hat, if desired. Wrap a piece of ribbon around the base of the hat to make the band. Decorate the hat with findings. Hot glue the top hat to a hair comb or headband.
This will ensure that the jar is perfectly clean and oil-free. Any oily residue left on the jar may keep the Mod Podge from sticking.   This method will not give you perfect jars, but it is great for something quick and easy. It is also great for children.  It might be a good idea to cut the tissue paper just a little bit bigger; it is always easier to cut something down than to add on to it.Your jar can be any color you want it to be, but white, light blue, light green, and pastel turquoise are the most popular colors for sea glass.  Since you will be covering this layer up with tissue paper, it does not matter what finish of Mod Podge you use. If you can't find any Mod Podge, or even a similar decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing together 3 parts white school glue and 1 part water.  A quick and easy way to do this would be to set the jar down on top of the tissue paper, and then to roll it.  To prevent the tissue paper from wrinkling, you can cut small slits into it. This will cause the tissue paper to overlap, and lay smoothly against the jar instead.  This will help seal the tissue paper.Make sure that you are using a matte finish, or your sea glass jar will turn out glossy.  After this, your jar is ready to use!	Wash your jar, then wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol. Cut a sheet of tissue paper large enough so that you can wrap it around your jar. Coat the jar with Mod Podge. Wrap the tissue paper around the jar, gently smoothing down any ripples or creases as you do so. Smooth the tissue paper over the curved top and bottom edges of the jar. Apply another coat of Mod Podge to the tissue paper. Wait for the Mod Podge to dry.
Take a strip of painter's tape and wrap it around your fingers with the sticky side facing outward. Dab the tape over the roller until it's completely free of lint.Removing lint from the roller with ensure that you have an even paint job.  Before you load your roller, you'll want to make sure that the paint doesn't have any lumps and is smooth as possible. To do this, make sure that you thoroughly stir the paint with a painter's mixing stick or paddle before transferring it to your paint tray or bucket., Once you've loaded your paint roller, you should wait for a minute to allow the paint to soak into the roller. This will make your paint job more even and smooth., For water based paint like latex, priming your roller may make it easier to load it. Saturate your roller under cold water from the faucet. Quickly roll the roller six or seven times in the air, then dry the rest of it off with paper towels.While priming your paint roller isn't necessary, it may make applying and loading your paint roller easier.	Remove lint from the roller with painter's tape. Mix the paint thoroughly. Let the roller sit for a minute after loading it. Prime the roller with water for water-based paints.
Cut a short piece of cheap masking tape and hold it by either end. Gently press it down on your shirt or another clean surface to thin out some of the adhesive. Tear off a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5.1 cm) pieces off the tape and attach the ends to make loops with the adhesive side up. Place the loops on the underside of the stencil. Press the stencil gently onto the fabric.; ,  The stencil should have a wide enough border that you can ink the negative space without leaving any “blow by,” or ink outside the stencil.   Try to lift it straight off without dragging it from side to side to avoid smudges.	Adhere the stencil to the surface you want to airbrush. Fill in the negative space with ink. Pull the stencil off and remove any tape that remains on the airbrushed surface.Make sure the ink on the stencil is dry before you use it again.
There are different types of air drying clay that are ideally suited for different purposes.You'll need to know what you are using the clay for, in order to determine which type of clay is right for you. These are other questions you should ask yourself:   How big is my final product going to be? How heavy do I want my final product to be? How much money can I spend on my clay? Do I want my clay to have a heftier, "premium" feel (usually applies to jewelry/trinkets/beads)?; , Usually, larger projects will benefit from paper clay. Since they require a lot of material, you'll save money. The finished project will also be much lighter.   Paper based clay feels fluffy to work with, but is hard and light when it dries.Paper based clay will be fluffy and chunks of it will break off in similar fashion to cotton candy., Equally strong, resin based clay (sometimes called porcelain based clay) is much denser, and when it is dried seems much more similar to baked polymer clay. It is also much more expensive and heavier.Smaller projects like jewelry or beads benefit from the "premium" feel of resin or porcelain based clay.Resin based clay is denser and will pull apart like fudge, caramel, or toffee., After you've determined what type of clay you want to purchase, you'll need to go out and buy it. Be sure that you buy enough for your project, but don't buy too much. Opened clay is hard to store and can easily become hard to work with and useless. . You can purchase your clay locally at a arts and crafts store, or purchase it online.   If you still aren't sure what type of clay to use, or want advice on your project, some stores have clerks that can answer your questions, and even offer classes.Purchasing your clay online will usually give you better prices and options, but you may have to wait several days for it to arrive.  Begin working over a smooth, clean, nonporous surface. Open your sealed bag of clay and pinch off the amount of clay that you want to use. If your project is larger and you need several bags of clay, only open one for now.   You can use a wire or floss to "cut" chunks of clay off of a block. This is useful for accurately measuring how much you are using.  Kneading and massaging the clay will soften it and make it easier to work with. The warmth of your hands will spread to the clay and make it malleable. Conditioning the clay is essential for proper use. If you planned to work with multiple bags of clay, knead them one at a time.   If using multiple bags for one piece, knead the clay together after each bag of clay has been warmed and kneaded separately. If using paper based clay, you can add a small amount of water to additionally soften the clay. Resin based clay can be softened (and colored!) with acrylic paint. , Both three dimensional and flat figures are easy to make with air drying clay. Use your hands and tools like knives, spoons, or even spinning wheels to form and shape the clay as you desire.   Crafting tools (or even dental picks and equipment!) can be very useful for creating more complex projects, as you can be much more exact with them.If you are making a larger project that needs to stand up such as a vase, make sure that it has a large, flat base.  You can press beads, yard, or even other pieces of clay into your project. Be sure to be careful, as you'll need to use enough pressure to press your decoration into the clay without changing or squashing your project. , Since clay spoils easily once it has been opened, ideally you'll have used it all. If not, leftover clay can be tightly wrapped in wax paper and stored in a plastic bag. It won't be as simple to work with or as useful afterwards though.Tough excess clay can sometimes be saved by (carefully) using a microwave to warm the clay up.  Find a clean, smooth, nonporous surface where your clay can dry for 24 hours. Put your clay down and do not disturb or move the clay while it dries. You'll need to be patient to make sure that you don't ruin your project.   A cool, dry area (one with low humidity) is best. Mild air circulation is also helpful. Thicker projects (over 1cm) may take even longer to dry.Better to be safe than sorry.  After 24 hours the clay should definitely be dry to the touch, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is ready. If your clay project is thick you may want to give it some extra time. There are other ways to visually evaluate if your clay is ready as well.   Resin based clay turns darker and more translucent.Paper based clay will stay very opaque.  Once it is dry, carefully remove the clay from the drying area and take it back to your work area. You may want to lay down some newspapers or an old sheet. Be careful, while the clay will be hard it may be quite brittle. Don't drop it and risk breaking it.  If desired, you can decorate your project further! Tempera, acrylic, and watercolor paints can be used on dry clay projects.You can also use glue to attach beads, sequins, fabric, and other fun decorations to your clay project.	Determine the type of project you are using air drying clay for. Choose paper-based air drying clay for larger projects. Choose resin-based air drying clay for smaller projects like jewelry. Buy your clay. Open your clay. Knead your clay until it is soft. Shape your clay. Decorate your clay. Store your excess clay. Dry your clay. Check if the clay is dry. Remove the clay from the drying area. Decorate your clay.
Making clothes requires a bunch of different tools for sewing, for making patterns, and for measuring the patterns to make sure that they will fit you. You will need to learn each type of tool and how to use it. In the beginning you won't be comfortable with all the tools, but the more you practice, the easier it will become.          Iron and ironing board. It's fine to use whatever quality iron you already have, but you'll probably want to eventually invest in a higher quality one. You'll be using the iron to press the item being sewn as you are sewing as this makes sure the seams stay open properly. Seam ripper. You'll use this when you've made a mistake to rip out the wrong stitches. Chalk for marking the fabric so you know where to sew and where to cut. You'll need a really nice, sharp pair of scissors that you designate for cutting cloth only, otherwise the scissors will dull more quickly and can damage or fray your fabric. Tracing paper for drafting your patterns and modifying the patterns as you're sewing. Rulers for drafting and measuring while you're constructing your piece (both in the design stages and the sewing stages). Tape measuring, especially a flexible tape measure. You'll use this to take measurements and make fit adjustments if you need them. Pins for holding the fabric in position before you start sewing. Pins should be used only sparingly as they can distort the fabric that you're working with.; , There are basically two types of sewing machines, ones that fall into the household         Household sewing machines tend to be more portable and more versatile. They tend to do a variety of stitch types. However, they don't work out as well in terms of speed and power, and they aren't very good with heavy fabrics. Industrial sewing machines are much more powerful and much faster, but they tend to only be able to do one type of stitch (such as a straight lockstitch). They do that one stitch very well, but aren't terribly versatile. They also tend to take up a lot more room.  Hopefully your sewing machine will come with an instruction manual, because that will tell you which direction the bobbin is going to spin and where the bobbin case is. However, you're going to need to know at least the basic components of your sewing machine before you can get making fun things.          The spool holder holds the spool of thread and controls the direction of the thread while it goes through the sewing machine. Depending on the type of machine you have, your spool holder might be horizontal or it might be vertical. Bobbin is basically a spindle that is wound with thread. You have to wind the bobbin with thread and fit it into the bobbin case (which is found under the needle plate). Your sewing machine also has different stitch adjustments to help determine stitch length for each stitch, the amount of tension needed to make sure the stitches come through properly, and the different types of stitches (if you have the type of sewing machine that does different stitch types). The take up lever controls the thread tension. If the thread tension isn't at its proper level the threads will knot up, jamming the sewing machine. You can check with a nearby sewing shop to see if they have any classes or know anyone willing to help you get set up with your sewing machine, or you can ask a knowledgeable family member or friend.  When you're just beginning with making clothes you'll want to start out with simple designs, otherwise it's easy to get frustrated and quit. It's best to start with skirts, because these are easier to make than say a 3-piece suit and they require you to take fewer measurements.          When you're first starting, try to avoid making clothes with buttons or zippers. Do aprons or pajamas with elastic bands. Once you've gotten the hang of your tools and your sewing machine, then you can start advancing.  The best way to make your final piece the best it can possibly be is to make test clothes beforehand so you can tweak your design and make any changes to the final piece as you see fit.          It's recommended to use scraps from the same fabric as the final piece.  Even if you're making clothing from a pattern that you found somewhere, instead of creating one yourself, you're still going to need to take your measurements so that the clothes will fit you when you're finished.          For trousers, you will need the following measurements: waist, hip, crotch depth and full leg length from waist to floor. For shorts, use the trouser measurements you have, only shortening the pant length to the desired length. For shirts, you will need the following measurements: neck, chest, shoulder width, arm length, armhole length and shirt length. For skirts, you simply need waist and hip measurements. The length and fullness of the skirt will vary depending on what type of skirt you want to make.  Sketch a pattern for your garment using the measurements you took. Use a similar garment as a guide for the appropriate pattern design and layout. There are lots of good places you can find pattern ideas.         Second hand stores and sewing shops often have fun vintage patterns (especially for dresses) and there are lots of easy patterns to be found online.  Deciding how to lay your pattern pieces out will take some careful planning.          Fold the fabric, right sides facing together, matching selvage to selvage. The selvage is the finished edges of the fabric that keep it from unraveling. Folding it like this will provide for easy cutting of double pattern pieces (sleeves, legs, etc.) and large symmetrical pattern pieces. If you have large pattern pieces that are symmetrical and can be folded down the middle (shirt back, for instance), then fold the pattern piece down the center and pin the folded part of the pattern on the folded edge of the fabric. This saves cutting effort and ensures the cut fabric piece is perfectly symmetrical. To make clothing that hugs the body, it is best to lay pattern pieces on the bias (at a 45 degree angle to the folded edge). To sew a garment that has no stretch, place the pattern pieces at a 90 degree angle to the folded edge.  You have to make sure that your fabric is wrinkle-free otherwise it can screw up your final piece, if the wrinkles make the fabric come out of alignment.  This will tell you wear to cut. Make sure that it is still wrinkle-free and that the pattern pieces and the fabric are aligned properly.  Be sure to cut through both layers of fabric.  You're ready to get started with the sewing process.  Determine which edges you must seam together and pin the 2 fabric pieces together, right sides facing together, at the seam edges. Insert the pins at a 90 degree angle from the edge so you don't have to remove them as you sew a garment.           This will take time, so try to be patient as you work. If you mess up at all, don't worry, that's what your seam ripper is for.  You need to make sure that you have the correct needle for the task and the correct thread. Different types of thread and different types of needles work best with different types of fabric.          You'll need different techniques for animal fiber fabrics like silk or wool or alpaca, as opposed to natural fibers like cotton or flax and synthetic fibers like rayon or polyester. Make sure that you know the type of fabric you're using and what type of needle and thread will work best with it. Gently guide the fabric through the machine. Don't push or pull your project, because the machine is supposed to do that itself and you can clog the sewing machine or ruin your garment.  Make clothing complete with clean, finished edges.          Fold the edge up, wrong side facing in, to the desired width of the hem and press the fold together. Fold the pressed edge up 1 more time and press again. Now, Sew along the top folded edge of the hem, inside of the garment.  This could be anything from buttons, elastic, zippers to various fun embroidery or special stitches. The better you get at sewing and making your own clothes the more creative you can get with adding those finishing touches.  Since every style of clothing is a bit different, there are some key points for each that are good to remember when you're choosing what clothes you want to make and how you want to make those clothes.         There are lots of different types of skirts to choose from: a-line skirts, circle skirt, flared skirt, gathered skirt, maxi and mini skirts, pencil skirt, pleated skirt and the list goes on. You'll need to decide which skirt you want to try out.The most basic skirt that you can make is a tube skirt, which requires an elastic band and the fabric (a stretchy kind is good). You can make this in about an hour and they are fun, comfortable and easy to wear.The general order that you sew a skirt in is: side, front, and back seams, zipper or closing method, waistband, hem.  Since trousers are incredibly versatile and can be made out of just about any fabric, they are a great project to do once you've gotten the basics down. You can make them more easily by making trousers that have an elastic waistband, or you could get more complicated with zippers and buttons and waistbands.          The general order that you sew a pair of jeans (or other trousers) is: pockets, side, front, and back seams, zipper or closing method, waistband, hem.  Again there are tons of different kinds of dresses to make, from some short, sweet summer cotton, to a long flowing ballgown. Dresses can be more complicated than, say, a skirt, so you'll want to hold off making one of these until you've got the basics down.          The general order that you want to sew a one piece dress is: interfacing, the shaping shoulders, side seams, top part of dress except for hem, bottom part of dress, back, and front seams. Then you join the skirt bottom to the bodice top of dress at the waistline, attach zipper or buttons holes, hem.  Although fun to make, these can be a bit more complicated, since you'll need to do buttons and sew on curves (since you're sewing along the lines made by your neck and your shoulders). There are also more patterning pieces that you will have to deal with.          The easiest type of top to make is a throw over knit top without buttons or pockets. The general order that you want to sew a shirt (or a jacket) is: interfacing, the shaping shoulders, zippers or button holes, shoulder seams, side seams, neck and front edge, armhole, sleeves, hem.  Jackets and coats are one of the more complicated clothes-making projects. They are something you will want to hold off on making until you've gotten a good amount of experience since they include buttons and pockets, working on contours rather than straight lines, and are made from lots of patterning pieces.          The easiest jacket type is one that doesn't have a lining or that doesn't have to be sewn into sleeves.	Learn the different tools you'll need. Acquire a sewing machine.

Let your girl band’s name come to you as organically as possible. The less thought and attempt at cleverness, the better. Create the music and allow the name to come to you., Appearance is also an important part of the girl band package. Create a visual match that is complementary to the sound of the band.You and the other ladies don’t have to wear the exact same thing, but dressing in a similar style might take less focus away from the band itself. One person standing out more than the rest of the band could pull focus away from what people really should pay attention to: the sound. All-black ensembles are a great way to look uniform without dressing exactly alike. Another way to do that is to come up with a theme that dictates what the group wears: goth, vintage, girly, or punk.  Your image should be an extension of your music. Think of the image of the band as the invitation and your music as the actual party.Don’t make your image an inauthentic version of yourself. If your band has an Ingrid Michaelson aesthetic where you all wear glasses in understated clothing as you play an intimate coffee shop, be authentic and allow your image to reflect that. Don’t feel the need to be scantily clad if sex isn’t something you’re trying to sell. Your image will be what fans will see in promo shots of the band, flyers, and your band’s logo. Keep this in mind and try to be consistent in your brand awareness.	Find a name for your group that will be remembered. Agree on the band’s style. Be as authentic to your voice and persona as possible.
If a store claims that a piece of furniture is solid wood, that means that it only contains wood. Plywood, on the other hand, is layers of wood and resin or glue. Solid wood tends to be more durable, though it is usually more expensive.If you can see an unfinished edge of the furniture, you should be able to tell if it's plywood or solid wood. Plywood will have visible layers.; , Plywood can be pretty solid and last a good amount of time, as long as it contains enough layers. Look for nine or more layers when examining plywood furniture. You should be able to count layers on an exposed side.For instance, if you're looking at a dresser, look at where the joints come together (such as in the back), which should have an edge where you can see the plywood layers.  Veneer is when a cheaper wood is covered with a thin layer of higher quality wood. It's not as good a quality as solid wood, but solid, beautiful pieces can be made out of veneer. In fact, you can even sand and re-stain these pieces, though you don't want to sand too much, as you can wear through the veneer layer.Veneer actually doesn't split as much as hardwood. On the other hand, you may get blistering over time, or the veneer may start to peel up.When choosing veneer, look for a thin veneer layer rather than thick veneer. Thick veneer is more likely to split. You'll be able to to tell on the edges. Thick veneer will be visible., Each type of wood has something different to bring to the table. Some woods are cheap and plentiful, while others will stand the test of time more readily. If you know the type of wood the furniture is made out of, you know a bit more about it's quality. "Hardwood" and "softwood" more often refer to the type of tree than the durability of the wood, so pay attention to the type of wood instead.For instance, pine is cheap, so it's used fairly often. However, it's relatively soft, so it dents and dings easily.Oak is hard-wearing. It also has a distinctive, visible grain, so you need to appreciate the look.Walnut is also hard-wearing, but it has a variation in color that may or may not be to your taste.Cherry is a more expensive wood, due to its fine grain and beautiful color.Maple is not as expensive, but it is extremely durable. It is also easy to stain any color you'd like. Mahogany is more expensive than maple, and it is also a quality wood.	Look for solid wood. Expect nine layers or more if you choose plywood. Look for veneer. Know your woods.
The color could be complementary or matching, depending on your preference.; , The ribbon will need to be able to stand up as little flags, so it needs to have some substance. Good quality satin and grosgrain ribbon make ideal choices. The ribbon will also need to be wide enough to appear like a flag.   It's recommended that you purchase ribbon in various widths, to add interest to your ribbon flag displays (unless it's important for you to have size uniformity). A variety of flag sizes can make for a pretty centerpiece display.	Choose ribbon in a color befitting the occasion. Choose quality ribbon.
Find a clay that is soft enough to shape with ease. It should be hard enough that it won't stick to your hands when you draw them away from the clay. The clay should be consistent in color.; , Thick canvas cloth or dry concrete are suitable kneading surfaces. Canvas will keep the clay from sticking to tables and other surfaces. Ensure that the surface is clean, and is at a height that will allow you to be comfortable when pressing down on the clay.,   Throw the clay down forcefully onto the kneading surface. Bear down on the clay using the weight of your upper body. Do not flatten the clay completely. Push the clay down about halfway to the kneading surface. Draw the clay towards you. Pull the clay up into a pile. Push down on the clay until you have flattened it halfway. Ensure that you do not press the clay past the middle section of the lump. Flattening the clay completely may result in air bubbles being trapped in the clay. Continue to draw and press the clay ten times more.  Use a clay cutter to slice the lump of clay in half.    Slap one cut half of clay forcefully on top of the other. Press the top half of clay into the bottom half. Ensure that you do not leave space where air may get caught between the two halves. Arrange the halves so that their cut edges are both facing out to the left or right side when pressed together. Aligning the halves of clay will help free the clay of air bubbles. Cutting the clay and rearranging the layers ensures that all parts of the clay mix together evenly. , Cut the clay using a clay cutter. Draw your finger over the surface of the cut edge on one of the halves of clay. The clay should be smooth and should display the same texture and color throughout the ball. If there are any rigid or weak spots or obvious lumps, continue kneading the clay before sculpting it.	Purchase a quality clay. Select a porous kneading surface. Press the clay. Cut the clay. Layer the clay. Alternate kneading the clay with cutting and layering it until you have kneaded the clay between 50 and 60 times.  , Check the clay's readiness.
For this bubble mixture, you will need three ingredients: distilled water, liquid dish soap, and glycerin.Glycerin is a natural moisturizer. When added to a bubble solution, it prevents the bubbles from drying out. This makes the film harder to pop.You can purchase glycerin from your local pharmacy.; , Measure and pour 1 cup distilled water into a clean container. Stir in 2 tablespoons liquid dish soap. Finally, mix in 1 tablespoon Glycerin to the soap-water mixture., Bubble solution gets better with time. Before using, allow the solution to sit in a sealed container for at least one hour. For optimal use, let the solution rest for 24 hours., When you’re ready to use the bubble solution, gently swirl the mixture. You can use your hand or a spoon. Do not shake the mixture—this will disrupt the suds.	Gather the supplies. Combine the ingredients. Let the solution sit. Swirl the mixture before use.
Every vehicle comes with a list of service recommendations to ensure it continues to operate properly. You may be able to address a number of these things, but some many be beyond your level of mechanical expertise. Check in your owner’s manual for service recommendations, then choose which ones you feel you can handle on your own.Some vehicles require timing chain or belt replacements every certain number of miles. This may require removing the engine from the vehicle itself and should not be ignored. Failing to properly maintain your timing chain or belt could result in serious damage to the engine.  Once you have identified a maintenance service you’d like to have done to your vehicle, contact the local dealership for your make of vehicle and ask to speak to the service manager. Ask for a quote on what conducting the necessary service may cost. The service manager should be able to provide you with a fairly reliable quote, as they likely conduct regular maintenance on vehicles like yours often.The dealership that specializes in your brand of vehicle is the most likely to have the tools and expertise required for difficult maintenance tasks. Some dealerships may provide a loner vehicle to drive while they work on your vehicle.  You may also want to get service quotes from other dealerships in the area specializing in your make of vehicle, or even from local garages. Some small garages may not have the equipment necessary to do specialized jobs on uncommon cars, but they can often fulfil most service requests.Don’t always opt for the least expensive quote. Try looking up the shops you are considering online to read reviews from previous customers.  Once you’ve chosen the place you’d like to conduct the maintenance on your vehicle, call them again to schedule an appointment to bring your car in. Remove any personal belongings from your vehicle before leaving it at the dealership for service.Make sure you know whether or not you can wait for your vehicle there or if you should make arrangements for a ride. Depending on the nature of the job, it may take hours or days to complete the maintenance on your vehicle.  When you bring your vehicle in, the service manager or techs may point out other issues they have identified over the course of conducting the maintenance, or offer suggestions for other things you may want to address while your car is already there. You do not have to permit them to do any additional work, so consider what they suggest and make a determination based on your own finances and what’s best for the vehicle.Some things recommended by the service manager or techs may be issues that should be addressed immediately, while others may be something you can resolve later on. Never feel pressured to pay for additional services that you do not want.	Review your owner’s manual. Contact the service manager at your local dealership. Get quotes from other trusted dealerships or shops. Schedule a service appointment. Consider service recommendations made by the dealership.
Loosen the soil with a fork and remove any weeds or large stones. Use a rake to create a level surface. Use the head of the rake to lightly press down the soil and lightly rake the surface once more.; , You will also want to lay a plank of wood next to the line that you just made. Line the plank of wood up right next to the line that was formed by laying the string out as a guide.  The narrow hole that you are digging should ideally be about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) deep in length.  Then, using the head of the metal rake, lightly firm the soil.  The soil should be kept moist and free of weeds throughout the growing season.  Push the sides of the fabric into the soil, or fix it in place with canes. Remove the barrier when the seeds germinate and the plants are visible through the soil.	Prepare the site. Lay a piece of string on the soil as a guide to make sure you dig the row in a straight line. Use a cane, or other tool, to dig a narrow hole that you will place the seeds in. Using a hoe, gently cover the seeds with soil. If the soil is dry, water the seeds in. To protect your plants from late frosts in Spring, build a frame to cover the drills.
Doing so reverts your Nook to factory settings, so you will lose all data you had saved to it. This is expected if you plan to sell your Nook, but if you are not selling it, only do this if you are advised by a professional that you have no other option for fixing a problem.

Cut the soap base into ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeter) pieces. This will help the soap melt faster and more evenly.Some types of melt-and-pour soap bases have cutting guidelines, which you can use. Make sure that you are using the melt-and-pour type of soap base, as regular bars of soap from the store won't melt. You can find melt-and-pour soap bases in the craft store and online.   You can also use 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of white glycerin melt-and-pour soap base instead.Melt-and-pour soap is a great way to get started in soap making because you won't be working with lye, which can be dangerous.; , There are two ways you can do this: in a double-boiler on the stove or in a glass container the microwave. Choose the method that works the best for you, then remove the soap from heat. Keep it in the container you melted it in.   Stove: Assemble a double-boiler. turn the heat on to low. Add the soap to the top bowl. Allow the soap to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally. Take the pot off the stove, then let the soap finish melting.Microwave: heat the soap for 30 seconds. Give it a stir, then heat it for 10 seconds. Stir it once more, then continue heating and stirring at 5 second intervals until the soap has melted., Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir. This will help keep things from settling on the bottom., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make the soap more nourishing., Stir them in with a spoon until the color of the soap is consistent and no streaks remain. You don't have to add the dye in, but it will help make your soap more pink and reminiscent of calamine lotion.You can also leave out the dye if you prefer.   Make sure that you are using soap making dye. Candle dye and fabric dye are not skin safe, and food coloring can stain.  Once again, you don't have to do this, but it can make the soap smell nicer. Use a calming fragrance, such as rose or lavender. If this is for a kid, try something associated with the color pink, such as bubblegum or cotton candy.Make sure that fragrance oils meant for soap making. The kind used for making candles are not considered to be skin-safe.You can try using essential oil instead of fragrance oil. Make sure that it is skin-safe as not all essential oils are.  You can use a round or square PVC mold. You can also use individual soap molds as well. If you use a round or square mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars after it dries.For a more unique mold, cut off the bottom 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of six water bottles, and use that instead.If the mixture forms bubbles, spray the surface with rubbing alcohol. This will make the bubbles disappear., This will take 30 minutes if you are using several small molds. It may take up to several hours if you are using one big mold., Simply turn the mold over, and pop the soap out. You may have to wiggle the sides to loosen the soap. If you used a large mold, such as a round or square PVC mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars. You should be able to make 3 to 4 bars.Once you pop the soap out of the molds, it is ready to use!   If you used plastic water bottles as molds, you'll need to cut the bottles apart with a craft blade, then slide the soap out.	Cut or break apart 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of goats milk melt-and-pour soap base. Melt the soap in a double-boiler or in the microwave. Stir 2 tablespoons of calamine lotion into the melted soap. Break apart 5 vitamin E oil capsules and add them to the soap. Add 2 drops of red soap making dye, if desired. Add 0.25 to 0.5 ounce (7.5 to 14.8 grams) of fragrance oil, if desired. Pour the soap into a soap making mold. Allow the soap to cool and dry. De-mold the soap.
First first change the soil to a mix of sand, bark, gravel and fibrous loam. Terrestrial orchids of the Pleione, Sobralia, Calanthe, Phaius and Bletia genuses can be grown in a well-drained area with a lot of shade.  Place some moss on the tree and set the orchid on the moss. Gently tie the orchid to the moss and branch with a nylon or fishing line. In time, the roots will cling to the tree.   Place orchids in baskets or with their roots exposed on trees if you live in an area with constant rain.  Roots may rot if there is too much water in a pot. Make sure water can drain out of the pot through a hole in the bottom. Also, do not place the pot in a secondary pot.	Grow terrestrial orchids, which grow in the ground, in your garden. Cultivate orchids outside year-round, if temperatures allow, by hanging orchids on trees. Cultivate some types of orchids outside year-round in pots, too.
If you want to join multiple pieces of silver together, soldering is typically the easiest home method. It still requires quite a bit of preparation, and the following materials:   Use a "medium" or "hard" silver solder made from silver alloy, not standard solder. Avoid solder containing cadmium unless you have a respirator. A small oxy-acetylene or butane torch, preferably with a flat "chisel tip." Any brazing or soldering flux labeled as suitable for silver. Copper tongs and tweezers (of any metal) for handling the silver. A "pickle" solution for soldering, heated according to label instructions before you begin.  You'll need a well-ventilated room and a heat-resistant work table, plus a heat brick to work on. Goggles are essential for detail work, to protect yourself from spatter during close inspection. Gloves, a denim or leather apron and tight-fitting, non-synthetic clothing are good additional precautions.   You'll need a container of water anyway to rinse the jewelry, but a fire extinguisher doesn't hurt if you are working in a room with flammable materials.  If the silver is greasy or has been heavily handled, rub on a degreasing solution. Dip in the pickle solution if the silver is black from oxidization. Once clean, brush the flux onto the silver, over the areas to be joined.   Powdered flux must be mixed into a paste or liquid form first. Check the instructions for details.  If you have never soldered anything before, this in-depth guide may help. Alternatively, you can follow these quick steps:   Position the objects carefully on the heat brick, then apply a chip of solder (or a dab of solder paste) with tweezers. Heat from about 4 inches (10 cm) away, focusing on the thicker piece of silver. Do not heat solder directly. Hold thin pieces of silver with tweezers to prevent melting.  Once the solder has melted along the gap between the pieces, turn off the heat and wait a minute or two for the solder to solidify. Use your copper tongs to dip the silver first into the water bath, then into the pickle solution to remove oxidization created during soldering. Rinse a final time in water, then pat dry.   Avoid putting the pickle in contact with skin and clothes, as it can be corrosive. Non-copper tongs may react with the pickle, corroding the metal. If you prefer the look of "aged" silver, you can skip the pickle.  These are best added to jewelry with a two-part epoxy glue. Solder a silver "bezel cup" to the jewelry, sand the walls down if necessary with coarse sandpaper, then glue in the stone and let dry as instructed by the epoxy label.	Gather materials. Set up a safe work area. Clean and apply flux. Solder the silver. Rinse, pickle, and rinse again. Add gemstone or glass (optional).
One of the most popular hydrangea species, Hydrangea macrophylla, does best in hardiness zones 6–9, with minimum winter temperatures of -10 to +25ºF (-23 to -7ºC). A few species can tolerate zone 4 conditions (-30ºF/-34ºC), including H. arborescens and H. paniculata., Hydrangeas may suffer when planted in hot temperatures or frost. Container-grown hydrangeas are best planted in the garden during spring or fall. Bare root hydrangeas without soil should be planted in early to mid spring so they have time to adapt to their new location., Ideally, the hydrangea should get several hours of sun each day, but be protected from the hottest afternoon sun by a wall or other barrier. If this is not possible in your yard, select a location with bright partial shade throughout the day., Hydrangeas can grow to become 4' by 4' bushes (1.2m x 1.2m). Research your species and variety online if you want a more accurate idea of how large your hydrangeas will grow.  Mix compost into your soil if it is low in nutrients. If your soil is dense or mostly clay, mix in pine bark or other mulch material in order to prevent water from forming pools around the plant.  Roots can become tangled or clustered together, which makes it harder for them to grow out into the soil once they're planted. This can limit the amount of nutrients the plant absorbs. To loosen your roots, cut a few of the outside roots, then gently shake the roots apart. Once the inner roots are free, they will be able to spread out into the soil., Dig a hole about as deep as the root ball or potting container, and two or three times as wide. Carefully lift the hydrangea and place it in the hole. Be careful not to scrape or break the roots while moving the plant.  Press the soil gently together as you fill the hole to remove air pockets and provide support to hold up the plant.Stop when the hold is approximately halfway filled.  Water the half-filled hole thoroughly, then leave it to drain for at least 15 minutes or until there is no standing water. Fill in the rest of the hole in the same way you were filling it before, pressing down small portions of soil at a time. Stop when the roots are covered. Do not bury any more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the trunk or stem.  Newly transplanted plants may not yet have roots functioning at full capacity, so it's important to water them well. Water once more when you're finished filling the hole, then water daily for the first few days after planting.  Once the hydrangea is established in its new location, water whenever the soil is about to dry out. Make sure that you give it a deep watering each time, not just a sprinkling of water. The soil should be kept somewhat moist, but not soggy. Hydrangeas do not usually require additional care, and often grow or bloom without difficulty.   If your hydrangeas wilt or dry out, construct a shade to block the sun during the afternoon. You can also try using mulch. If the winter forecast predicts unusually cold or prolonged frost, or if you are planting in a lower than recommended hardiness zone (see above), you may need to provide winter protection for your hydrangeas.  Some varieties of hydrangea can bloom pink or blue depending on the soil's aluminum content and acidity. Most cultivated hydrangeas of this type belong to the species Hydrangea macrophylla, but some members of this species only produce white blooms, or favor the pink or blue side too heavily for easy adjustment. Ask the previous owner of the hydrangeas to identify your hydrangea variety if you are not aware of its name.   The varieties named Enziandom, Kasteln, Merritt's Supreme, Red Star, and Rose Supreme all have the ability to be grown as pink or blue blossoms, although they vary in intensity., Most garden supply stores sell a pH test kit for measuring the pH, or acidity, of your soil. Because acidity affects the hydrangea's ability to take in aluminum, which in turn affects the flower color, you can get a rough prediction of the flower color by measuring the soil pH. As a rule of thumb, a soil pH below 5.5 will likely result in blue flowers, and a soil pH of 7 and up will likely result in pink or red flowers. The effects of soil pH levels between 5.5 and 7 are difficult to predict. They may result in blue, pink, or purple flowers, or in a blotched blue and pink pattern., To encourage a blue color during the growing season, mix 1 tbsp (15 mL) aluminum sulfate into a gallon of water. This both adds aluminum to the soil and increases the acidity (lowering pH), making it easier for the plant to use the aluminum.Once every 10–14 days, Apply as much of this water as you would in a normal watering. Continue to measure the pH of the soil, and stop applying once it drops below 5.5 pH.   Alternatively, you can also create blue blossoms by applying a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium. Look for a 25/5/30 fertilizer blend. You'll also want to avoid superphosphates and bone meal., If the hydrangea is already blue, it is hard to make it pink due to the existing presence of aluminum causing a blue color. However, you can take precautions in advance to encourage pink blooms, or you can grow your plants in a pot. Avoid planting near driveways or walls, as some concrete mixes or mortars can leach aluminum into the soil. Apply a fertilizer that contains no aluminum, but high levels of phosphorus, which inhibits aluminum uptake. Look for a fertilizer that contains a 25-10-10 blend.Consider raising the pH by adding wood ash or crushed limestone to the soil, as this also makes aluminum uptake difficult. Avoid raising the pH higher than 6.4, or the plant may develop health problems.	Check your species' hardiness zone. Know the safest times to plant. Choose a place in your yard that gets a mixture of sun and shade. Allow enough space for it to grow substantially. Prepare rich, porous soil. Loosen the roots. Carefully plant the hydrangeas in a spacious hole. Fill the hole halfway with soil, a little at a time. Water the hole, let drain, then fill the rest of the hole with soil. Water the plant frequently for the first few days. Reduce the watering but keep the soil damp. Check whether your species and variety produces different colors. Test soil pH. Turn blooms blue. Encourage pink blooms.
Cutout wire, also called windshield removal wire, is a high-strength braided steel wire that is used by auto body shops to repair windshields. It can be purchased from auto part stores either by itself or as part of a kit that includes convenient handles on either end of the wire. You will be working the wire between the mirror and the drywall, so you need a length of wire longer than the diagonal dimension of your mirror.; , Doing this will minimize the amount of shards that will go flying in case the mirror breaks. Even if you plan to salvage the mirror for later use, this step is a necessary safety precaution. The tape's adhesive can be removed later with a solvent.  Begin by stretching the wire tight and sliding it between the mirror and the drywall in any corner. Wiggle the wire back and forth to wedge it behind the mirror.  Once the wire is wedged behind the mirror, work it towards the opposite corner. Using a slight back-and-forth sawing motion can keep the wire from getting stuck. As you work the wire towards the other corner, it will cut through the adhesive joining the mirror to the wall. It is strongly advised to have another person hold the mirror steady while you do this, so that it doesn't suddenly come loose.  Once the cutout wire has sliced through most of the adhesive, you should be able to lift the mirror away from the wall. This process is likely to tear away some of the drywall paper, so expect to have to repair the wall later.	Purchase a length of cutout wire. Apply clear packing tape over the face of the mirror. Work the cutout wire behind a corner of the mirror. Run the cutout wire behind the mirror from the first corner to the opposite corner. Lift the mirror down gently.
Wash it and allow it to dry.   Consider whether adding any dents would "age" the piece nicely or just look dented. This will depend entirely on the style and type of furniture, along with your guesswork. ,, Choose a few other places where removal of the paint surface to allow the metallic surface to show through would look "strategically shabby".  The rubbed areas will look worn and distressed.  Follow the manufacturer's application instructions.	Select the metallic furniture item. Paint the whole piece with metal-suitable paint in the color of your choice.  , Dip a clean cloth into water to dampen.  , Rub the dampened cloth over one small part of the wet paint. Allow the paint to dry. Coat with a suitable clear wax. Finished.
You should plant any flower other than a pansy after the last frost of the spring. Pansies are heartier and can withstand the cold. Other flowers will die if you plant them and a frost comes.Find the average last frost date from the previous year. Search online at plantmap.com for the last frost in your area. You can also use the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to obtain data on the last frost date in your location. Certain plants will thrive best if they are planted during a specific time or at certain temperatures, so pay attention to the care instructions for your plant. For example, irises grow best if you plant them in the late summer or early fall instead of in the spring. You can go to www.garden.org to read more about how to care for your specific plant. Note when you are buying your plants that annuals will grow just one season and perennials will last at least two seasons.  You don’t need to create a border; however, you should know where the perimeter of your bed is to know where to plant. Take a shovel and mark off the diameter of the bed. Remember that you should start planting a foot out from the trunk of the tree, so 24 inches may be a good place to make a perimeter.  Do not dig up the soil around your tree because you may end up digging up the roots with the soil. Instead, create a bed of soil around your tree. You can just dump soil around the tree to create the bed, or you can use bricks or logs as a border for the outer edges of the soil.  Make sure to make the soil bed around the tree deep enough for your plants to fit into.  If it is a small pack with several flowers, push up from the bottom and lift the plant out from the roots. Untangle any roots that are stuck to the bottom of the container. If it is a potted plant, place your hand over the surface of the soil, and turn the plant over into the palm of your hand.  Take the outside of the root ball, and gently untangle some of the roots at the edge of the root ball. You do not want the roots to remain a dense mass, and untangling them a bit will allow the roots to plant more easily into the new soil. , Gently put the plant into the new soil, and take your new topsoil and cover the flower roots. Then press down on the soil around the base of the flower with your hands. Now your plant is almost set- repeat the above steps to plant the rest of your shrubs and flowers before you water.   Hold the plant by the roots rather than by the stems at all times.  When you are planting, do not plant the flowers or shrubs too close together. Find out how big the plants are going to grow, and consider how densely you want the area to be populated with plants. Leave at least 2-3 inches of space between each plant. In addition, you should maintain your flower bed by weeding regularly. Use your hands and pluck out any unwanted plants that are growing around your flowers and plants by the root. If weeds are left unattended they can choke your flowers and take their nutrients.   Make a schedule on your calendar for when you should be weeding your flower bed to help keep you on track with your weeding.  Water consistently after you have planted your plants. When the plants roots have to compete with the roots of a tree they will need more water. Set a watering schedule for your plants to help you keep track of when you have watered them and when you will need to water them again.  You can add organic matter or more topsoil to your garden that is suited for your kinds of flowers, perennial or annual. You need to add organic matter because the bacteria and fungi in organic matter is food for your plants. You can make your own organic matter for your garden by composting. Using your vegetable scraps, garden clippings, leaves or manure, you can provide the nutrients your plants need to thrive year after year.	Know when to plant. Set a perimeter for your bed. Build a raised bed around your tree. Take the plant carefully out of its container. Loosen the roots of the plant. Place the plant in the hole, and cover it with soil. Leave your plants room to grow, and weed your flower bed regularly. Water the area where you have planted your flowers thoroughly. Every year add another inch of organic matter to your garden.
The key to sizing this cozy is to get the right number of stitches to go that distance.  Because this is a crocheted fabric, it will be a little stretchy, so aim to crochet something that is a bit snug.; , Chain until you have about three inches. Chain two more and double crochet into the third chain from the hook. Double crochet one stitch per stitch back across the row you created.  Try to count in the middle to avoid figuring in any unevenness at the ends. Here, there are seven stitches (gauge stitches) in two inches (5cm) (gauge length). Measure the stitch length in the same units you used to measure the bottle circumference.    gauge stitches / gauge length = total stitches / bottle circumference total stitches = (gauge stitches x bottle diameter) / gauge length here, total stitches = (7 stitches x 9 inches) / two inches = 31 stitches.      For this example, round down to an even 30 stitches for easier math and a slightly tighter fit. Jot this number down. Unravel the gauge piece if you wish to recover the yarn.  The idea is to come out with a flat disk, about the same diameter as the water bottle or a bit smaller, and with as many stitches as the "total stitches" number above in the final row. ,   The example shown uses a total 15 double crochet into the ring. , Then double crochet into each stitch from the first round. The example uses 2 stitches per inch to arrive at 30 stitches, the "total stitches" number from above. Add additional rounds if needed to produce the diameter required. See the tips below on how to do this.  Chain two and double crochet one stitch into each stitch of the previous round.  You could chain one and single crochet this round instead, but the double crochet produces a sharper-looking "corner" at the bottom of the bottle cozy. To avoid a spiral effect (optional): Place a stitch marker at the beginning of the round. Each time you reach it, join with a slip stitch and chain one. Otherwise, just stitch into the next available stitch. This is a bit more important (but still not required) if you want to make the ribbon loops.      At one stitch per stitch on a round piece such as this, two things should happen. First, the edges should curl up (or down) and start to form a cylinder. Second, you should have the same number of stitches in each subsequent round.  If it's too loose, you'll need fewer stitches in the last row of the round base. If it's too tight, add a few stitches, either to the round base or to one of the bottom rows of single crochet right near the base. Either way, it's best to find this out now.  With a good tie at the top, they are mostly decorative, but if you'd like, you can make them line up with a feature on the bottle, such as a narrower section.  If you don't want the optional ribbon loops, continue the entire bottle cozy in a single crochet until you reach the desired height. Place the loops a bit lower than you think you will need them, remembering that the piece will stretch somewhat when in use.  Finish the round at the bottom of where you want the loop.  Chain three.      Double crochet into the next two stitches from the previous round (total of three double crochet including the chain).       Triple crochet into the next stitch. The triple crochet is a little too tall for the row of double crochets around it, so it forms a sort of belt loop that will stick out if you tug on it a bit.      Continue the pattern of three double crochet followed by a triple crochet for the rest of the round. Make a one or two loops with only two double crochet between if you need to to come out even on number of stitches and loops.      Join with a slip stitch, chain 1, and proceed with additional rounds of single crochet as before.   Finish with at least one round of single crochet. Stop short of the neck of the bottle.  Chain six (or some other number that produces a desired length). Skip three stitches (or some other number that produces the desired spacing), and slip stitch into the next stitch. Repeat all the way around. , Any ribbon, cord or yarn will do. This cozy uses six strands of leftover yarn, braided tightly and tied in a simple knot at both ends to tie the bottle in.  Use a cord that doesn't stretch too much for the top closure. Thread the ribbons through the loops formed by the triple crochet as you would a belt through belt loops. Tug on the loops gently to open them up, if needed. You can tie the ends in knots or bows, tuck them in, stitch them together, or leave them hanging loose to create the effect you prefer.      Lace a cord or braided yarn through the loops around the top and tie the bottle into the cozy. Tie it so that you'll be able to get the bottle out again for cleaning.  You could crochet or braid them from any yarn that's left over, use more of whatever ribbon you're using, or recycle some fabric (perhaps an old necktie?), whatever you prefer.	Measure the circumference (the distance around) of your water bottle. Measure your stitches. Count the number of stitches in the test piece and measure their length. Do a simple proportion. Create the circular bottom of the bottle cozy (see tips for more information on customizing this). Tie a slip knot, chain a few stitches (4-6) and join with a slip stitch to form a ring. , Chain 3 to start the first round (counts as first double crochet) and double crochet into the ring. Slip stitch to join. , Chain two to start the second round (counts as first double crochet). Form the sides. Try the base on the water bottle in the first couple of rows. Decide where you'd like the ribbon loops, and how many you'd like. Create the ribbon loops. Continue alternating several rounds of single crochet with a round of loops until you reach the height you desire. Create the loops for tying the cozy closed.Tie off and stitch in the ends. Add ties and laces as desired. Fashion any handles or straps you want and stitch them to the cozy or use the loops already built in to attach them.
Shorter names more often result in memorable and brandable names. Long and convoluted names are hard to remember and easily overlooked.; , Don't name your project after a pre-existing entity. If you're pulling names from Greek mythology, Christian references, or a family of animals, it has most likely been done before and it will be difficult to turn it into something fresh and original.   One exception to this is if you're going to append an identifier to your name. For example, the name "Zeus" is too generic and overused on its own, but if you are developing a new instant messenger, the name "ZeusIM" could work well.  Projects like YouTube, Facebook, and Myspace prove that using generic words in new ways can result in a very recognizable brand.  The names "Zxthx" or "Sivbrev" might look interesting and unique, but if your project name can't be said easily and effortlessly in the middle of conversation, people won't talk about it very often.  Google, or if you want your project to describe its purpose, e.g. Lifehacker. Nobody knew what "google" meant when Google first started; they only got to where they are now through careful brand building. On the other hand, descriptive names can immediately let your audience know what your project is about without having to build a brand beforehand.  Running your proposed name as a search query can show you whether or not there are other projects with the same or similar names. If you receive a lot of search results with that name, that means you'll have more competition for that name.  This step is especially important if you plan on having a web presence for your project. If you've decided on naming your project "Tomato Chat," you should look to see if tomatochat.com or tomatochat.net are available. If they aren't available, you may want to reconsider your name.	Pick a name that is short. Choose a name that is unique. Consider combining words or making up new words entirely. Make sure your name is easy to pronounce. Decide if you want your project to carry a brand, e.g. Check your proposed name in a search engine. Check domain name availability.
Pour six cups of water into a pot. Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to medium-high. Once the water starts to steam or evaporate (about eight to ten minutes), turn off the heat and take the pot off the stove.Water that is 150 degrees Fahrenheit will provide enough steam. If the water is boiling then it is too hot. Let the water cool for a minute or two before you begin the steam inhalation.  Place a bowl on a table and pour the hot water into it. You may add herbal extracts to the water at this point. Add five to eight drops of extract to the water.You can add herbal extracts like chamomile, thyme, peppermint, lemon, oregano, and clove to the water for added benefits.  While you are sitting, lean over the bowl at a comfortable distance away from the steam. Place a towel over your head, shoulders, and the bowl to create an enclosure.This will trap the steam so you can breathe it in.  You only need to breathe the steam in for eight to ten minutes for this to be effective. Set a timer to keep track of the time. Once you have finished the steam inhalation, try not speak for 30 minutes afterwards. This will enable your vocal chords to rest and heal after the procedure.	Heat six cups (1,419.5 ml) of water. Pour the hot water in a bowl. Drape a towel over your head and shoulders. Breathe in the steam.
Acorn squash takes two and a half to three and a half months to mature, and, like most types of winter squash, can’t be picked before they are ripe.   Extra acorn squash seeds can be saved for six years.; , If you’d rather not plant your own seeds, you can wait until spring to find seedlings and starts at your farmer’s market or garden center.  If you have a longer growing season, start your seeds outdoors about two weeks after the first frost. , Seedling trays are not generally big enough for squash seedlings. Fill the pots with seed mix and sprinkle with warm water before planting each seed one inch (2.5 cm) deep.  Cover the pot with plastic wrap for the first few days to improve germination. Generally, the seeds sprout within 5 to 12 days.  They should be ready to transplant into your garden soon.  You need at least a three-foot (0.9 m) plot in all direction to grow winter squash without overshadowing other vegetables. Your bed should be in full sunlight.   If you don’t have three feet (0.9 m) to spare, build a trellis or use a fence to grow the squash vertically. They can be separated two feet (0.6 m) apart and trained to grow up the support system.  Aim for a pH content between 5.8 and 6.8 for best results.,, Then, plant in three-foot (0.9 m) mounds with approximately three seedlings per mound. Planting atop a mound ensures that the roots will not rot, since squash require a lot of watering.   If you are planting seeds directly into the garden, plant them in a mound with six seeds per mound. Thin to three plants after germination.Acorn squash that are planted near a fence or trellis will not need to be mounded.  After the broad leaves start to form, you should weed by hand regularly. The large leaves will shade out some weeds.  Let it soak for a few minutes to reach the whole root system. Water below the leaves to avoid powdery mildew and scab.  Cover your plants with netting cheesecloth while they are young, if you have a problem with cucumber beetles., They will have a dark green shell when they are nearing maturity. When the skin is strong enough to resist being pierced by your fingernail, they are ready to pick.  Use a sharp pair of kitchen or garden shears.  Find a cool, dry and dark place to store your squash.  If stored in a less than optimal area, they can last for two to three weeks. If stored in a cellar, they can last several months.	Ensure you have at least a three and a half month growing season in full sun. Purchase a packet of acorn squash seeds at your local gardening supply store. Start seeds inside three to four weeks before you expect the last frost of the season.Check your state’s almanac to see when that will be. Cover the seeds in a warm damp paper towel for a few hours, while you prepare your soil.  , Plant six seeds in three-inch (7.6 cm) pots. Place the seeds in a sunny window that you can supplement with fluorescent light. Thin the seeds to three per pot when they start to crowd. Prepare your beds. Amend your soil with compost in the winter, if possible. Aim to plant your seedlings when the soil has warmed to approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius).  , Loosen the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm). Place mulch around your squash for the first few weeks if you have a weed problem. Water your squash mounds when the soil begins to dry out. Look out for squash vine borers that leave “sawdust.” You can remove them by hand. Test the acorn squash individually after two to three months. Cut the squash from the stem, leaving approximately one inch (2.5 cm) of stem on the squash. Rinse and dry the surface. Place them side by side rather than stacking them.
For best results, choose a pair that is roughly the same shade as the pillowcase used for the tunic. The pants should be fairly tight rather than baggy. Semi-baggy pants will work as long as they fit, but pants that are just wide enough to slip on and off are ideal. If desired, you can slim the pants by having the intended wearer try them on and pinning along the sides to desired tightness. Turn the pants inside out and sew along the pin-line. Finally, cut off the excess material and turn the pants right-side-out again.  Cut two long strips of canvas, felt, or another strong fabric in a shade that matches the pants as closely as possible. The strips should be long enough to extend from the waist to the hem of the pants along the sides. To create the fringe, cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) slits along one side of the strip. Space the slits approximately a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) apart.The strips should be about 1.5 inches (3.8-cm) wide. If you’re short on time, you can also use store-bought fringe.  Use fabric glue or a needle and thread to attach the strips of fringe to the sides of both pant legs. If you want to make sure that the pants can be worn multiple times, it’s best to sew on the fringe. Glue or sew along the 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide section of the band that does not have fringe on it, and apply it over the side seam on each pants leg. If you prefer to wear a skirt with your costume, add the fringe all along the hem of a brown or tan skirt instead.	Find an old pair of tan khaki pants. Create fringe for the sides. Attach the fringe to the pants.
All Great British stamps come from Royal Mail. But not all covers come from them. Royal Mail does produce its own covers but several private producers do too. These are the ones to choose if you want to collect covers that could be worth something in the future. Royal Mail covers are fun but will never be worth much more than what you paid for them because they are mass produced and have your name and address printed on.; , There are several main private producers; Buckingham Covers, Benham, Westminster and Adrian Bradbury. Buckingham Covers and Adrian Bradbury are the first for quality. Buckingham Covers are seen as the best investments, because the company actively buys back their own covers, often at higher prices than they sold them. Benham were traditionally UK’s leading cover producer, but in recent years they seem to have lost their way.  Some people like to have everything and collect lots of covers every year. This may not be for you and my advice is to buy what you like. Quality counts, so buy the best you can afford and covers carrying genuine signatures add to their value.  How many of one cover should be produced? Future value does not depend on the number produced, it depends on the number of new collectors and a large appeal. So don’t fall into the “only 50 produced, they will be worth a fortune trap”. Very small numbers make the people who have them happy and just annoy the ones who haven't. At the other end the cover may be a limited edition of 1000, which is fine if they are selling out but not if they still have 600 in stock. Why not give the producer a call and ask them how many they still have available. But which ever way you decide to go buy the cover you like first.  All newly produced covers should have no address on them and if you are interested in older covers, try to purchase ones with pencil, printed labels or typed addresses.  This will keep them safe and protect them. Keeping your covers in good condition helps them hold their value. If you want to show of your covers, why not frame them for the wall? Be sure to use acid-free mounts and boards and do not hang in direct sunlight.	Who produces first day covers?, What cover producer to choose?, What covers to collect?, Limited Editions. Cover addresses. Looking after your covers: Purchase an album with leaves to hold your covers.
The shape of the rim is easier to ascertain without these on the bike. Reattach the rim to the bike for testing.  This will allow you to see minor fluctuations where the rim is closer to, or further away from, the straight edge.  The place on the wheel where that tool touches, or almost touches, the straight edge is out of true, and you’ll need to adjust it.  Make sure to tighten each spoke equally and no more than a half a turn at a time. Also make sure that you tighten the spokes on either side or you’ll throw the wheel out of lateral true.  Continue adjusting until the rim seems an equal distance away from the straight edge at all times.	Remove the tire and tube for best results. Place or tape a ruler, pencil or other straight edge by the forks so that the tool almost touches the rim. Spin the wheel. Tighten the spokes underneath where the rim hits. Spin the wheel after each adjustment.
You'll need to measure the following:   Bust Waist: This measurement should be taken at the natural waist, near your bellybutton. Waist to Underarm Measurement: Starting at your side, measure the distance from your waist to an inch or so beneath the armpit or to the top edge of your bra. Center Front: This will be the height in the front. A good starting length is 12 inches (30.5 cm), but you may need more or less depending on your back waist length. This length will increase or decrease depending on the style of corset you want as well.;	Take careful measurements.
Recording the sound of your electric guitar by miking your amp is a great way to simulate studio quality sound. However, this will require expensive equipment, like a quality amp, microphone, and potentially sound dampening equipment or material. On the other hand, you can plug your guitar right into a DI to record your guitar.A limitation of using a DI is the somewhat sterile nature of the recording it produces. A DI will only record the sound of your guitar, without any effects or normal speaker distortion.; , You'll need a program or machine that can interpret the recording you make and convert it into a suitable format. This kind of technology usually has the added benefit of allowing you to edit the sound you will record.DAWs and sound production software cover a range of features. Some are free, and some can be over $800 in cost.The most suitable DAW/software depends entirely on your purposes and situation.  Even with the best equipment adjusted to optimal settings, if you forget to tune your guitar, your recording probably won't turn out like you want. You may also want to replace your strings, as new strings create a brighter tone and have better sustain.Finger sliding can make unwanted squeaks while recording. Apply fretboard lubricant to your guitar beforehand to help prevent these from occurring.	Decide between mic recording or using a direct box (DI). Invest in a digital audio workstation (DAW) or comparable software. Prepare your electric guitar.
Word-attack strategies can help you figure out the meaning and pronunciation of unfamiliar words by taking on those words piece by piece and coming at them from different angles.    Look for picture clues. Check out the photos, illustrations or other visuals on the page. Explore what's in them (people, places, objects, actions) that might make sense in the sentence.  Sound out the word. Starting with the first letter, say each letter-sound out loud slowly. Then repeat the sounds, blending them together to form the word and considering if the word makes sense in the sentence.  Chunk it up. Look at the word and see if you can pick out any sound/symbols, prefixes, suffixes, endings or base words that you already know. Read each "chunk" by itself and then try blending the chunks together and sound out the word.  For example, if you know that "pre" means "before" and "view" means "to look at," you could figure out that "preview" means "to look at ahead of time" if you approached the word by breaking it up into those two chunks.    Look for connections. Consider whether the unfamiliar word bears any resemblance to a word you might already know. Ask yourself if it's a chunk or a form of the unfamiliar word.  You could also try using the known word in the sentence to see if it makes sense; it could be that the meanings of the two words are close enough for understanding.  Go back over the sentence again. Try substituting different words for the word you don't know and see if any of your ideas make sense.  Rather than getting stuck on a word you don't know, read past it and look for more clues. If the word is used again in the text, compare that sentence to the first and brainstorm as to what word might make sense in both.  Take into account what you know about the topic of the book, paragraph or sentence. Based on your knowledge of the subject matter, is there a word that might make sense in the sentence?  , Look at the pictures, table of contents, chapter headings, maps, diagrams and other features of your book. Then, based on what you saw, write down what you think the book will be about, what kinds of information might be included. As you read, keep updating your predictions based on what comes up in the text.  After reviewing the title, chapter headings, images and other information in the book, write down some questions you might have or things you're now curious about. Try to answer these questions as you read and write down the answers you find. If you're left with questions, think about whether you could find those answers from some other source.  Think of the story you're reading as though it were a movie. Get a good mental image of the characters and the setting and try to see the story unfolding in time and space. Identify and describe what's happening by making sketches, diagrams or cartoon-style grids.  Ask yourself if there's anything about the story you can relate to. Do any of the characters remind you of someone you know? Have you had similar experiences? Have you learned some of the concepts discussed in the book at school, home or through your own life experiences? Does the style of the story resemble a style you've read before or a movie or television show you've seen? Write down any similarities you come up with and use them to help with your understanding of the text.  One helpful way to ensure that something you've read makes sense to you is to talk through it with someone else. Once you've finished a paragraph, article, short story or chapter, sum up in your own words what it was about. Hearing yourself say it out loud and discovering if the person on the receiving end has questions you can or can't answer can point out any gaps in your understanding and what you might need to reread for greater clarity.	"Attack" the words. Reread. Keep reading. Rely on prior knowledge. Make predictions. Ask questions. Visualize. Make connections. Retell the story.
This will make the sound that makes heavy metal sound heavy. If your guitar is in standard tuning (EBGDAE) play an Em with palm muting. Just play the first three strings (EAD). Example: The bridge on Raining Blood by Slayer.; , Without them this will be useless. They give another heavy sound in the song. Power chords on the low E string sound great. Most metal songs use power chords, so it's basic. A great simple power chord progression is: Milk by Anthrax.  It will sound great, awesome and heavy. Example: Harvester of Sorrow by Metallica.  This will be more complicated but after you're in the right position you'll make it. Example: Master of Puppets by Metallica, Washington is Next! by Megadeth.  The rhythm is the important thing, not the heaviness. In the 80's The Big Four didn't downtune their guitars. But, it makes playing easier. Some good downtunings are Open G, Drop D & Drop C. The Drop C gives a kinda mystical tone. Bands that use a lot of downtunings are System Of A Down (Drop C), Disturbed (Drop C, Drop D and others), Rise Against (Drop D) & Dream Theater's John Petrucci uses a different tuning for each song.  You'll need these techniques: Sweep Picking, Bends, Vibratos, Tremolo Picking, Tapping, Slides, Hammer Ons, Pull-Offs, Thrills, String Skipping and if you want a little Zakk Wylde use some Pinch Harmonics. To get the hang of the soloing learn solos by Metallica (Master of Puppets album), Megadeth (Countdown to Extinction album), Slayer(Reign In Blood album), Anthrax & Dream Theater.  You have to use scales, and working on them makes you a better all-around player. Just go up and down the scale slowly at first, then try to incorporate scales into your playing.  Just pick up and down.  They sound cool, they're fast and help your alternate picking. Try muting the triplets. Example: Disposable Heroes by Metallica.  Heavy metal doesn't have any rules. If you want to make your songs heavy and dark use the above said scales. Harmonic minor gives a middle eastern feel, but you don't have to stick to a one scale. For a melodic sound use the minor scale.	Learn to palm mute. Learn how to play power chords. Add single notes in the space between chords. Play single note riffs. Downtune your guitar. Build up your solo technique. Practice scales to work on your technique and speed. Use alternate picking. For more rhythmic variety, experiment with triplets. Use scales like harmonic minor, melodic minor, diminished etc.
This isn't completely necessary, but a vocal teacher should be able to tell you how much work you have to do to make your voice classical and should be able to give you some good classical music to start out with.; , You don't have an accurate perception of what your voice sounds like, so just trust your teacher. Also, if you're beginning classical music, you simply don't have the expertise to brush off your teacher's advice.  The only way that you will enjoy classical music and truly understand how awesome it is if you are singing a song you enjoy. You'll practice more, and it will be more fun!  , It might be intimidating at first, but much, if not most of classical music is in a different language. If you aren't familiar with the language, that's okay! Just keep an open mind.  It's simple, but a lot of people don't realize how difficult singing is. To be a successful classical singer, you have to put in some effort.  If it's in a different language, get a translation! If it's in English, analyze it. To make real music, there has to be emotion. If you don't understand the lyrics, then you'll just be rattling off a bunch of notes!  , Most have great technique and can serve as inspiration for a beginner.	Find a good voice teacher. Always listen to your vocal teacher. Let your teacher know if a song isn't working for you. Don't be afraid to sing in different languages. Practice!!, Understand what the lyrics mean. Listen to famous classical or opera singers.
Unscrew the aerator at the end of the faucet with a pair of pliers. Disassemble the aerator, making a note of how it fits together. Rinse off dirt or sediment, then run the faucet for a couple minutes to dislodge sediment in the pipe. If the aerator parts still look dirty, soak them in an equal mix of white vinegar and water for three hours.   To avoid scratches, wrap cloth around the aerator before removing. You can clean showerheads with the same process.; , If the faucet still has low pressure, unscrew the stem retainer nut and pull the stem straight up. You may need to remove a retaining collar first.   When dealing with a single-handled tub faucet, you will encounter a screw on each side, under the large chrome piece. Assure that these are both fully tightened before removing the stem.  Check for problems based on what you see:   If you see a washer and/or spring at the base of the stem, remove them carefully with a screwdriver. Rinse off sediment, or replace them if broken. If you see a more complex mechanism, check this article for instructions.  After repairing anything that seems amiss, reassemble the faucet. Block the faucet with a cup and turn the water on and off a few times. This should flush out anything causing the clog.	Clean the aerator. Disassemble the faucet. Repair the faucet.

Having fringe hanging down from the top of your tapestry may not look very appealing. This method hides the top fringe behind a board or piece of wood, creating a cleaner and more polished look.         , You will use a piece of wood to hold up the tapestry so the size of wood required depends on the weight of the tapestry.          For normal applications you can use a piece of 1x2 (22mm by 44mm) or 1x3 (22mm by 72mm) wood but if your tapestry is particularly large or heavy you should consider larger sizes. , Paint the wood using to prevent acid deterioration of the tapestry where it will be touching the wood.          You will be able to see the board on the ends so use a color that either matches the wall or the dominant colors of the tapestry. , Cut a heavy canvas-type fabric so that it is a few inches longer than the width of the tapestry. Hand sew this canvas to the top front edge of the tapestry.          The canvas fabric should be about six or seven inches wide, but if more support is needed for heavier tapestries then you can use a wider strip. Make sure the stitches are straight even if the tapestry end is not perfectly straight or else you will end of with a crooked tapestry. You may need several rows of stitches when sewing on the canvas, especially for heavier tapestries. Make sure each stitch covers at least two warp threads and use heavy cotton thread that matches the dominant color of your tapestry. , Fold the ends of the canvas strip around to the back of the tapestry, enclosing the fringe and edges of the tapestry on the top. Then flop the entire piece over so that it is facing the back.         , Drill holes near the ends of the board so that they are centered and even. They should also be equidistant from the ends.         , Use a level while placing the board against the wall to mark the locations you will be drilling into the wall. The best option is to use a stud finder to find studs to drill into. Alternatively you can use drywall screws and place them directly into the drywall.          Insert wall anchors if you are drilling into drywall or masonry. Make sure the screws you will be using are strong enough if you have an especially large tapestry. Check the manufacturer’s label for their strength.  Slide the painted board underneath the flap so that it is between the canvas and top of the tapestry. Use wood staples to staple the canvas directly to the backside of the piece of wood.         , You may need help to hold up the tapestry while you are driving screws through the board and into your wall. Make sure the board is secure and level.          The canvas wrapped fringe and top edge of the tapestry should be between the board and the wall. Make sure you secure the board tightly against the wall to secure the tapestry in place. , Now that the board is securely attached to the wall you can bring down the flap of tapestry that was being held up. Make sure everything looks even and straight and admire your work!	Use this method if you have a tapestry with fringe at the top. Cut a piece of wood so that it is just shorter than the width of the tapestry. Paint the piece of wood. Hand sew a heavy fabric along the top edge of the tapestry. Fold over the edges of the canvas and flop this section to the back. Drill holes into the board or piece of wood for fastening to the wall. Use the board to mark and drill holes into the wall. Slide the board or painted piece of wood underneath this flap and secure with staples. Lift up the hanging tapestry and secure the board to the wall. Allow the flap of tapestry to come down once more and check that it is level.
Notice that it is in a fun, positive, and bright reggae style. You might like to write the words repeatedly as part of memorizing the words, if that works for you...; , This is so that you can copy and paste them into a word processor to make a formatted print out for your personal use only. ,   Do not strain your voice or sing raspily. Those methods can actually harm or ruin your voice when done harshly or for too long at one time. Sing out. Singing "under your voice" may not sound like you, or may sound weak or choked down.

After finishing the last knot, turn the bracelet over.  Tie a very strong knot using the two outside cords. Add a dab of strong glue to strengthen the knot. Allow to dry for at least an hour, or as suggested by the packaging. Repeat on the other side.  Leave the middle cord uncut. The two middle cords at either end of the bracelet should now be the only cords left.	Tie off the bracelet. Cut off the two outer cords to the base of the glued knot.
, If the line is leaking, then tighten all connections.  If the line continues to leak, then check for holes or cracks in the line. If cracks or holes are present, replace the line.  Correct any placement problems. If the pan has cracks or holes, then purchase a new one from a home repair store and replace it according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Pour a gallon of water and a teaspoon of bleach into the water tank. Let the solution sit in the tank for an hour to completely sanitize the inside of the tank. Pour out the solution and rinse with clean, cold water.   Be sure the tank has been thoroughly rinsed before you replace it on the humidifier frame. Don't let the bleach sit in the humidifier for more than an hour, or it could damage the machine.  Pour a few cups of peroxide into the water tank. Swish it around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the tank. Allow the peroxide to sit in the tank for an hour, then pour it out and rinse the tank with cold water.  Fill the water tank with a cup of vinegar and a gallon of water. Plug it in outside and let the humidifier run for an hour. After an hour, pour out the remaining liquid from the tank, rinse it with clean water, then fill it with clean water and run the humidifier for another hour. Rinse out the tank one more time before using.   Don't run the humidifier indoors when you're using vinegar in the water tank. It will make your home smell like vinegar. Don't use bleach or any other chemical to do a deep clean through the working part of the humidifier. Turning the humidifier on and running chemicals through the system could cause permanent damage.	Use a bleach and water solution. Use peroxide. Do a deep clean with vinegar.
Whereas a younger child may not have built up a lot of friends, older children looking for a middle or high school will have important social and emotional factors that affect their well-being. If your child already has a group of friends that have a positive impact on their life, you may want to not break this arrangement up. Also, things like bullying can become more prominent in older children. Find a school that has a strong anti-bullying policy and helps your child build up solid social skills. Finding out what sort of guidance counselor availability a school has can be one important factor in limiting bullying.  Around this age your children will start to be developing interests and schools will have offerings beyond the basics of education like math, english, and writing. Technology courses, foreign languages, and other special offerings can really distinguish one school from the next. Ask to see what electives the school has and sit down to talk to your kid and see how they may align with their interests. It is also a good idea to ask the school specifics about their programs, such as student-to-faculty ration, faculty training, and funding available to support students.  In high school your child may be starting to consider whether they want to continue on to college or pursue a trade. Schools that offer AP classes for college credit, a guidance program for navigating the application process, and even internship options are great for someone looking to continue on to college. If your child is interested in a trade, see if the school has an option to receive hands-on or technical training in various fields. Ask for statistics about where graduate go to college and what sorts of schools they get into. This can give you a general idea how well prepared students are for continuing on to college. See if they have options for students who are advances or excel at subjects. A high school with flexibility and a willingness to challenge students who go above and beyond can be great preparation for academic excellence down the road.  By the time your children reach middle or high school, they may have interests in a particular sport, playing a musical instrument, or perhaps as a budding thespian. Schools that are able to financially support your child's interests outside the classroom can provide a more edifying educational experience and help make them into more rounded maturing adolescents.  While where a school receives its funding does not necessarily make it better or worse than another school, there are differences between public and private schools worth paying attention to. Perhaps you want the structure of a religious education, in which case a private religious based school may be a good option. You'll also want to take into consideration other factors, like whether your child has friends in the community already, how far you are able to drive, and what you are able to financially afford.The main difference between public and private school options is funding. This can play a role in deciding the type of education your child will get. Public schools are funded by the government and thus typically have to follow set curriculums. This will mean it will be largely standardized and have to adhere to certain standards. Private schools do not have to adhere to these and their independence can be a strength. If your child has special needs, public schools are mandated by law to accommodate, whereas private schools will vary from one institution to another.	Take into account social and emotional factors. Take elective offerings into consideration. Ask about their post-graduate planning program. See what extra-curricular activities they offer. Decide whether you want a private or public school.
Cut and hem your T-shirt until it rests at your midriff. Then, cut slits in the shoulders for an even cooler effect. If you want to, you can cut the side seams and hold the shirt together with safety pins or ties.  With this halter design, you cut out your T-shirt, flip it and thread a string through the hem for a gathered bodice and tie. You can also skip the bodice and tie and cut strips of fabric across the shoulders that can be turned into ties.  This article will teach you to make a tank top from an old T-shirt. You'll need some basic sewing gear and a sewing machine.  If you have a high-quality T-shirt that you want to transform, you can cut and sew the T-shirt to make a bikini. Just keep in mind to make any ties very secure--otherwise, you could end up in an awkward situation at the beach!  , In this design, the body of your T-shirt becomes the mini dress while the collar and sleeves transform into the neck strap and bodice, respectively.	Make a Crop Top. Make a Halter from an Old Shirt (No Sewing). Make a T Shirt a Tank Top. Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini. Turn an Oversized T Shirt Into a Hot Mini Dress.
Your frame should be a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer and wider than the mirror's measurements. Make sure your mirror is thin enough or your frame is deep enough to hold it.  You won't want a glass in front of a reflective mirror.  Then fit the frame over the mirror.  A mirror is heavier than a picture, so make sure the hanging mechanism - the wire or the hooks - are strong enough to support the weight before you hang it to a wall.	Find a mirror and frame that match. Remove the frame glass. Secure the mirror onto the frame backing. Test the weight.
Being anxious or angry can make you drive more erratically. Maintaining control is key to resisting the urge to speed. Before you start your vehicle, relax by taking some deep breaths. As you drive, try listening to light music such as classical instead of tense-sounding music like hip-hop or hard rock. Focus on the road and let go of negative, emotion-laden thoughts.It’s okay to stop on the side of the road or in a parking lot if you need to reorient yourself. Start over by breathing and shaking out the tension. It can take a while before this becomes second-nature to you.; , Many people speed because they feel like they’re running late. Don’t put yourself in a situation where you feel pressured to get to work or an appointment on time. Take care of tasks at home, such as preparing breakfast or choosing an outfit, ahead of time. Give yourself plenty of time to get to where you need to go., Occasional glances at the speedometer will keep you in check. Take a quick look down to see how fast you’re going. Adjust your speed accordingly. The act of looking forces you to stay engaged instead of zoning out and driving by instinct. Remember to keep your glances brief so your eyes stay focused on the road., Cruise control is useful for straight, open roads that many people are tempted to speed on. Find the “Set” button on your car. Accelerate to the speed you wish to go, then press the Set button to maintain that speed automatically. You may use accelerate and decelerate buttons in your car to adjust the speed.The cruise control setting differs between car brands. Consult your owner’s manual for instructions on how to engage cruise control. Cruise control is not appropriate for winding roads, city roads, or rainy weather. In addition, the car’s speed is affected by hills. Watch out when you go down hills, since you’ll pick up speed. Braking usually stops cruise control in addition to slowing you down.  Dropping 5 mph (8 km/h) won’t significantly decrease your travel time. Staying aware of the speed limit and choosing to stay below it reduces your chances of accidentally going over it. Even if you notice a big difference at first, you’ll adjust the more you drive at the reduced speed., Racing games give you a chance to go fast without putting everyone at risk. Find these at arcades or on home computers and game consoles. You may also try joining autocross events or club racing with the SCCA. Get your speed fix before you have to head out onto the road.  Find ways to cut down on your driving. Check your area for bus routes. Sometimes you can park near the bus station and use the bus to travel the rest of the way to your destination. Biking or walking are also options for shorter distances. Is your office right around the corner? Take the opportunity to refresh yourself with some exercise., Your car may not have manual transmission, so you’d have to consider switching cars. With manual transmission, you have to shift up a gear using the gearstick to go faster. This is an easy way to limit your maximum speed. You’ll also learn to identify how fast you’re going by the sound of your engine., Mentally calculate how much that ticket will cost you. Tickets in the USA can set you back hundreds of dollars. Going faster than 65 mph (105 km/h) burns more fuel and causes more wear and tear to your vehicle. In addition, an accident you are at fault for can cost you much more.   Even if money isn’t an issue, think of the cost in lives. Your speeding is a risk to yourself, your passengers, and everyone else on the road. Remember what will happen if you, for example, hit a child who runs out into the street. Now think of how you’d feel if that was your child. The time you save by speeding doesn’t make up for the costs, so don’t rely on that as an excuse.	Relax yourself before driving. Leave earlier so you don’t rush to your destination. Pay close attention to the speedometer. Use the cruise control option to set a speed. Drive a little bit under the speed limit. Burn off your need for speed in a safe setting. Drive less often. Learn manual transmission. Figure out the cost for speeding.
When doing this step, it's important to look at a lot of reference images to make sure you know how each piece looks. That way, you can find or make pieces that more closely resemble Aoba's outfit.; , Even if it's not the original color of the cosplayer, you can substitute for black, or even a turquoise blue (something that will flow with the cosplay's color scheme) but for a better visual of Aoba Seragaki, you should use a black sleeved shirt.  Make sure it has the right look. Even if your wig is in good condition, brushing always prevents future tangles, so stroke a brush of your choice over your cosplay wig a few times just to make sure and you can get short blue hair if you want because Koujaku has cut his hair, but you can get the long blue hair too, it's you're choice.  There are many hair products available, so choose the one that suits to your needs best. It may also be helpful to ask people what brands or products they use, you can even style you're wig to look a little more gorgeous, because Aoba Seragaki's hair is already Gorgeous.   The trick to using hair gel is to rub it in your fingers like it's lotion, and apply it by twisting small bunches of hair and pulling them both outward, and downward. And voila! Just like magic your hair would look ten times better!  , After you've applied your hair product to your wig, now would be a great time to put on your jacket! make sure it's short and same as the one Aoba Seragaki has.  Aoba Seragaki, like many other characters, has cosplay headphones. If you cannot afford, or cannot get one shipped to you in time then try going to Hot Topic, or Walmart to get a pair of plain, red headphones for under $40, Aoba Seragaki's Headphones are Pink.  The step to cosplaying would be Aoba's glove, which is fingerless. Aoba only wears one glove and it's on his right hand.  Now that you're in your cosplay it's a good idea to take some in character photos to show off your cosplay. You can also cosplay with your friends as the other characters from dramatic murder or go to conventions in your cosplay and you can also take pictures to remind you of the day when you have gone to the conventions as Aoba Seragaki.  Don't be afraid to make the cosplay you wear unique and individual, just have fun!	Get your costume together. Make sure that you wear a long sleeved shirt. Put on your wig. Style your wig!, Get your jacket and put it on. Have some type of headphones like Aoba. Don't forget the glove. Take some photos. Remember it's not about having a perfect cosplay, it's about having fun.
Horror movies are a particularly formulaic genre, as anyone who has watched a lot of horror can attest. This means, however, that astute viewers can usually piece together the general arc of action and suspense. While this may "ruin" the scares a bit, it helps you realize that the scares in horror aren't real -- they are manufactured in a very similar way to get a very similar response from all viewers:    First is a scene meant to scare you immediately, such as the first victim or the release of the "evil" at the heart of the film.  Second comes establishment of characters and locations. This is usually the place of the first jump scare -- not the real villain or scare, but something to put you on edge.  Third comes the first death or scare, while people think things are still "normal" in the horror world. The jump scare usually coincides with this death, if there is one.  Fourth comes the worst/scariest part of the film -- the bodies mount up and the characters slowly realize that things are not looking good. Expect 1-2 more jump scares.  Fifth and finally comes the defeat of the villain (or is it?!), and this section is usually more action-heavy than the rest. There may be 1-2 jump scares, but they are usually easy to see coming., Because most horror films follow cookie-cutter plots, this isn't where most directors look for inspiration or originality. Horror is a very stylized, unrealistic genre that takes great creative leaps in lighting, costume design, sound/music, and theme in order to stay relevant. Most horror connoisseurs don't watch horror to get scared all of the time, they watch it to enjoy great artists pushing an extreme and stylish genre to its limits, all while serving up a delicious shot of adrenaline.    Cinematography in horror films is extreme and artistic. Pay attention to the lights and common colors, crazy camera angles, and interesting jumps or cuts.  Social themes are common motifs in horror, exploring what society fears through art. From Night of the Living Dead to It Follows, look for the real-life metaphors.  Sound and Music are subtle but key. It's been shown that sound on its own is often scarier than pure visuals. Anyone who's ever been alone at night in a creaky house knows that, but ask yourself how the filmmakers are able to pull off this same effect in the movie., A truly great horror movie is scary because you never see the events and scares coming. While all horror films will follow the "rules" outlined above to various degrees, you should be prepared for a great horror flick to break these rules in crucial, terrifying ways. The best way to avoid jumping, at the end of the day, is to never watch horror movies in the first place. But what is the fun in that?!  , You may get annoyed at how easily you flinch during a jump scare, even one that you see coming, but there is a very good reason for the jump. Almost all mammals share this "startle reflex," as it naturally moves you away from potential danger without having to take the time to think of it. Even if it's not fun, it is hardwired into human DNA to move when scared.	Recognize common formula used in 99% of horror films to get past the tension in them. Watch horror films with an eye for style over substance. Remember that the best horror movies are the ones that subvert, not conform, to your expectations. Know that your jumping or flinching is an evolutionary advantage worth keeping around.
You'll get sweaty and gross, so the least you can do is take a shower and put some body spray on. If you have long hair it's a good idea to wear a ponytail since your hair will get sweaty and will be in your face.; , Wear sneakers to help protect your feet because you'll get stepped on in mosh pits. Girls should wear shorts instead of skirts, as skirts may fly up if you're jumping around. Leave the earrings, necklaces, or loose things at home as they will get ripped, pulled, or broken. Wear glasses in mosh pits at your own risk; they could get broken as well. Also, if you're wearing plugs or other loose jewellery it's a good idea to take them out in mosh pits or at least tighten them before you go in Remember to consider the weather - if you wear pants and it's hot out, it will make for a sweaty and uncomfortable day. If the forecast calls for a sunny day, it'd be a good idea to wear sunglasses. No matter what the weather, always wear sunblock because you're outside all day and it's easy to get burned even if it's cloudy. Don't forget to put it on top of your head and ears.  Bringing the right items with you to Warped Tour can make the day go a lot more smoothly. It's important that you pack all of your stuff in a backpack or secure bag of some sort, because having to put all of your items in your pockets or carry a bunch of loose items around all day gets annoying and in the way. Make sure that your bag closes fully so nothing will fall out and so nobody can stick their hands in it to steal something from you. Some good items to bring are:   Money for the ticket and merchandise.       Paper and pen to write down the schedule.       Several water bottles.       A fully charged cell phone.       A fully charged camera (or an extra battery).       Sunblock and sunglasses.       Ponytail holder to hold your hair back.       Hand sanitizer or wipes.       Bug spray.       Sharpie (sometimes the band members don't have one).  Make sure to get to Warped Tour early, so you can get inside right when the gates open at 11 am. Arriving early will give you enough time to look at the grounds and memorize where certain places, such as the stages, information booths, and restrooms, are located.   Try to go to all the booths. Most booths give out free items such as CDs and pins, and the Monster Energy Station gives away free Monster drinks. Arriving early will also give you the best selection at the merchandise booths. The booths usually sell shirts, sunglasses, shorts, CDs, etc. Buying merchandise is a good idea because you can't get a lot of those things in stores and sometimes the band will be selling their own merchandise.  It is a big wall with all the stage names that have the bands and the times. Instead of running back and forth to see who is playing when, bring a piece of paper and pen with you to write everything down, or write it down on your phone. Sometimes they sell schedules at the front, so you could buy one there if that's easier.  Give yourself a lot of time to get to the stage they're playing at so that you can get a good spot before they start. How early to get there depends on how popular they are, so use your best judgement. Secure your spot and make sure you're able to see the band and that you aren't surrounded by people who could obstruct your view or get rough., Mosh pits can differ depending on what band is playing. For example, if it's a metal band, a circular pit will usually form in the center where people like to dance hardcore. Mosh pits are intense, so prepare to be rubbed up against a lot of sweaty people, including some greasy shirtless guys. If you can't take a pit, don't be in one. If you get in and then decide that they're not for you, or you accidentally get pushed in, edge away as fast as you can. If you feel like you're about to pass out or someone is about to crush you, put your arms in front of you and leave the pit through the side, saying "excuse me" as you go.  Mosh pits combined with hot weather will wear you out and make you sweat, so staying hydrated is super important! Water can get expensive, so be sure to bring your own water bottle. You will be able to fill it up whenever you need to. Many venues will not allow you to bring an open water bottle into the grounds, so ensure that your bottle's seal hasn't been broken yet, otherwise they might just throw it away. Also, avoid freezing your water bottle as frozen ones might be taken away as well. If your bottle gets taken away, find the Medical Tent and tell them you feel dehydrated. Most of the time they will give you a free bottle of water. As desperate as you might be for water, don't accept a drink from anyone except venue staff - you never know what that person might have put in it.  There are casual signings where you can have a brief moment with them, or you can try to meet them in front of the gates where their buses unload. If you are not allowed through the gate, this means that only the performers are allowed, and they will go through at some point (usually after they play, when they're going to get food, or when they've finished eating).   If you do meet a band stay calm. Avoid screaming, crying, or jumping up and down. Just walk up to them and say hi, and they will most likely say hello back. If they appear to be in a hurry, be as brief as possible and ask them for a quick picture, hug, or a signature. If they stay and talk to you, have a genuine conversation with them. Ask if they're enjoying themselves and what future events they're playing at. Don't brag about how big a fan you are. Instead, say something that will make them laugh, smile, or remember you in a good way.	Make sure that you are clean. Dress appropriately. Be prepared. Arrive early. Check the schedule. Go to your favourite band's stage early. Figure out whether you can handle the mosh pits. Stay hydrated. Try to meet the band.
Extend your arm straight out so that it is perpendicular to the rest of your body.   You can work with either the left or right arm. It is easiest to take an accurate measurement for your Armhole if you have a second person helping you. Your helper will need to use the tape measure while you keep your arm in position. If you do not have a helper to assist you, it might be easiest to measure the Armhole of your non-dominant arm while using your dominant hand to hold and maneuver the tape measure. You should stand in front of a full-length mirror, as well.; , Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure flat against the the center of your shoulder. Draw the tape measure down over the front of your shoulder and arm, pausing once it hits the center of your armpit.   This measurement is sometimes referred to as your Armhole depth.It is not a full Armhole measurement, however, so you should keep going if you need the full measurement instead of the depth measurement. Keep the tape measure flat against your body. It should also be vertically straight along the front of your body.  Continue wrapping the tape measure around your arm and shoulder, drawing it up from behind your shoulder until it meets the starting end.This measurement is your full Armhole measurement. The tape measure must be vertically straight along the back and front of your shoulder. Make sure that it also lies flat against your body. Note that your full Armhole measurement should be twice as large as your Armhole depth. Since it may not be exactly twice as large, though, it is best to take the actual measurement instead of mathematically doubling the depth measurement.  With the tape measure held in place, move your arm around. Rotate it back and forth, then up and down. The tape measure should not be tight enough to restrict the movement of your arm in any way.   As a general rule, place two fingers underneath the measuring tape and against your body as you take the measurement. Do not stretch the tape, either. Following these two precautions should prevent the Armhole from being too tight.When in doubt, a measurement that is slightly too large is better than one that is too small.	Raise your arm. Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit. Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder. Keep it comfortable.
There are steps you can take to improve your credit score as much as possible before you attempt to apply for bad credit financing:   Order your credit reports from each of the 3 credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. Verify that the information on your credit reports is correct. It is not unusual for credit reporting agencies to make mistakes that could wrongly lower your credit rating. Sometimes, improving your credit score is as simple as disputing inaccuracies on your credit report. Pay small judgments and past-due accounts off. Even nominal amounts that are reported as negatives on your credit report can impact your bad credit for the worse. Paying them off could save you money in down payment and interest. Wait 6 months after cleaning up your credit reports to buy used cars on credit. This will allow time for the credit updates and scoring improvements to take place.; , Be prepared to have to accept a high interest rate and to have to put down a large down payment.  List all of your expenses and compare them to your income. That way, you will know exactly what you can afford to pay per month and you can avoid getting yourself into a situation that could further worsen your credit.  If you have bad credit, you can expect to have to make a relatively sizable down payment in comparison to scenarios involving good credit. Plan on putting down 10 percent of the car's value.  It is best that you get pre-approved for an auto loan before you go shopping. Try these avenues:   Dealerships. Find an auto dealership that specializes in used cars and bad credit financing. These are often referred to as "buy here pay here" lots. Credit unions. If you already have an account at a credit union, you may want to inquire there first. Credit unions are generally more lenient with their qualification requirements than other banks, especially in regards to their members. If you are not a credit union member, join a credit union and ask about auto financing for problematic credit. Cosigners. You may be able to find a friend or family member who will cosign for you to help you obtain an auto loan. Sub-prime lenders. These are lenders that specialize in lending to those with damaged credit. An Internet search will return numerous sub-prime lenders, and you can often fill out an application online and have an answer within minutes.  Once you find a used car you are interested in buying, sit down with the salesperson or manager and negotiate the lowest purchase price you can.  You will need to prove employment, income and residence, and provide whatever documentation the finance professional requires of you.	Optimize your credit. Set realistic expectations. Prepare a budget. Save money for a down payment, title, tags, taxes and fees. Look into auto financing for problem credit. Negotiate the sales price. Complete the credit application.
Great artists in any field need to have a working knowledge of the legends who laid the groundwork in the field, as well as the contemporaries currently shaping the industry, and rap is no different. Spend time listening closely to everything from Run DMC to Tupac to local artists around you who haven’t made it big.   Being a connoisseur alone isn’t enough. Break the lyrics and rhythms of your favorite and least favorite songs down into component parts. Ask yourself what succeeds and what fails in every example. Hold yourself accountable to the same standards you hold other rappers. If you realize that you’re tired of hearing some worn out rhyme in other songs, then you need to avoid that same pitfall yourself, for instance.; , Think you've got a good idea for a lyric? Write it down where ever you can! Writing down your ideas will help you improve your rap skills since you will have more concepts for raps as well as an ever expanding vocabulary of lyrics.   Poets and other writers regularly keep pocket-size notebooks on them at all times, so they can easily write down great lines before they forget them no matter where they are. If you have a smart phone, plenty of note-taking apps exist as well. Waiting for inspiration to strike before you write will limit your productivity, so try to make yourself write every day. Try giving yourself writing assignments. For instance, you can assign yourself thirty minutes or maybe even one verse to write each day. Enlist the help of friends to ask about your daily progress if you don’t think you will pressure yourself enough to do it on your own.  Rap and hip-hop are essentially poetry with a heightened emphasis on the internal rhythms of the language, so don’t be afraid to look at some modern poetry movements for inspiration.   For example, Saul Williams is an American poet and winner of the Nuyorican Grand Slam Champion prize.He has also worked with Nas, Kanye West, and Jay Z. The wide array of structure, meter, and other lyrical devices found in poetry may even influence you to try something new to the rap genre that you never would have considered otherwise.  Plenty of rappers bring a comedic approach to their music, but the time-tested artists usually have something serious to say beneath the jokes. Try to relate to your listeners and rap about things with meaning. Rap about current events, social issues, or even everyday observations.  Rappers are musicians whose voices are their instruments. Voice lessons will help you with range, melody, and a variety of other singing aspects.  Just as a guitarist might learn how to play Jimi Hendrix songs to practice skills, you should practice rapping along to some of your favorites to improve your flow and timing.   Don’t pick easy songs or just one artist. Practice a wide range of songs with variations in tempo, rhyme scheme, and song length to exercise several different skills with regard to your singing. “Alphabet Aerobics” by Blackalicious is a perfect tongue-twisting example to put your flow skills to the test., In addition to rapping along to other songs, try doing other exercises to increase your precision with diction. This page offers a diverse list of tongue twisters to practice, and they even come arranged by letter if you need to work on a specific sound.  Practice rapping every chance you get, whether it is in your bedroom, outside, or in the car. The more you practice, the better your flow and skills will become. Try rehearsing your own raps in several different styles and at different speeds as well. This is both good practice, and you might stumble upon an unexpected flow as well.  Record yourself rapping and play it back to see what you are doing right and wrong. This is also a great way to practice different approaches to the same material since it gives you an easy way to compare them afterward.   Previous recordings also give you a way to gauge your progress, which is hard to measure when you work on something every day.  Sometimes ideas won’t come to fruition in the way you want. In these scenarios, it’s better to set something aside and come back to it later.   This also means knowing when to let go of an idea. Sometimes a project ultimately becomes about salvaging one great line and scrapping the rest, So don’t be afraid to start over.  Freestyling can greatly help you improve your rap skills. If you can think of a good line on the spot, there's no doubt you can think of a great line in the comfort of your own home.  Friends and family can listen to your raps and help you improve. You can also go to other aspiring rappers for tips and help.	Analyze what other rappers are doing. Write everything down. Look for inspiration in other inherently lyrical art forms. Work on your message. Practice voice lessons. Rap along to your favorites. Do diction exercises. Practice and then practice some more. Listen to yourself. Know when material isn’t working. Freestyle. Get others to help out.
Although you already know that you want to learn on an acoustic guitar, there are still other things to take into consideration. Look for the best size and price for your lifestyle. Avoid buying budget acoustic guitars, as they are typically made poorly and are very difficult to play. Typically, look for guitars that cost, at least, $300. These are better quality and have a better sound than cheap guitars.          Find a guitar with a low action. The action is the distance from the strings to the neck of the guitar. A high action means you have to press down harder on the strings which can be painful and difficult for beginners. Finding a guitar with a low action will make it easier and more comfortable to play. Always buy wooden acoustic guitars. Although you can sometimes find acoustic guitars that are made of a composite material, their sound isn’t as good as classic wood acoustics. Avoid a ¾ size guitar, even if you or your hands seem very small. The sound this size of guitar creates is not as good as a full size, and with practice even a very small person or child can play a full sized guitar. If you are left-handed, be sure to purchase a special left-handed guitar. Otherwise, the strings will all be in reverse order for you. Don’t be afraid to use an old or used guitar instead of buying new. As long as the guitar is in good condition and makes a good sound, there is no problem playing a used instrument. Many people think they sound better, even.; , Before you start playing, it is important that you understand all the basic parts of a guitar. While the "body," the big rounded base of the guitar, is obvious, knowing the other parts makes playing much easier.          The neck of the guitar is the long narrow part of the guitar where you can find the strings. It is on the bottom, with the fingerboard (or sometimes called the fretboard) on top. The flat place you hold the strings to is the fingerboard. The headstock is the wooden piece at the end of the neck where the tuners are located. This is where the strings end. The fret wires are thin metal strips that go across the fingerboard. A fret is the space between two fret-wires. The first fret is the one closest to the headstock, and they count up as you move towards the body of the guitar. The bridge is the small metal or plastic bit on the body of the guitar that the strings attach to. Right next to the sound hole. This is where you begin if you need to put new strings on your guitar.  The thickest, lowest-sounding string is low-E. This is the 6th string. Then, moving away from low-E, the strings go A, D, G, B, and high-E. You can remember these strings with the mnemonic, "Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie."          Note how the highest string, the thick E, is the 6th string. The strings on the guitar count upwards, meaning the bottom string (the thinnest one) is the 1st string.  Before you start to play, you need to make sure your guitar is in tune. If it is not, then your music won’t sound good. Even if you buy a brand new guitar, you should always make sure it is in tune.          To tune the guitar, twist the tuner knobs on the headboard of the guitar. These work to make a string tighter or looser which changes the sound. Always start tuning your guitar from the lowest note and work your way to the highest. Because the thicker a string is, the less likely it will go out of tune, you should always start with low-E. Buy an electric tuner to help you find the right notes. These work by listening to the sound a string makes and telling you if the note is flat or sharp. Without a tuner, you can tune your guitar using a piano or keyboard. These instruments stay in tune for many years and are a reliable way to match tone. Play the same key on the piano as the string you are trying to tune, and twist the tuner until the plucked string makes the same sound as the piano key. Humming along may help. , Once you’ve gotten your guitar all settled, put your body in the right position for playing. If you are just beginning, you will probably find it easier to sit rather than stand and play.          Rest the guitar on your strumming knee. If you are right-handed, this will be your right knee. You may find it helpful to raise your toes off the ground a bit to get the guitar at the right height. Hold the neck of the guitar so that it rests on your thumb and your fingers wrap around to the top of the fingerboard. Keep your shoulders, elbows, and wrists relaxed. Your elbow should be in towards your body.	Choose your guitar. Learn the anatomy of your guitar. Know the strings. Tune your guitar. Set the guitar up so you can play comfortably, with relaxed shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
This has the arc-shaped scales visible through the window and a pointer which will indicate the values read from the scale.The arc-shaped marks on the meter dial face may be different colors that indicate each scale, so they will have different values. These determine the ranges of magnitude. A wider mirror-like surface shaped like the scales might also be present. The mirror is used to help reduce what's called "parallax viewing error," by lining up the pointer with its reflection before reading the value the pointer is indicating. In the image, it appears as a wide gray strip between the red and black scales. Many newer multimeters have digital readouts, rather than the analog scale. The function is basically the same, you'll just get a numerical readout.; , This allows you to change the function between volts, ohms, and amps, and to change the scale (x1, x10, etc.) of the meter. Many functions have multiple ranges, so it's important to have both set correctly, otherwise serious damage to the meter or harm to the operator may result.   Some meters have an "Off" position on this selector switch while others have a separate switch to turn the meter off. The meter should be set to "Off" when stored and not in use.  Most multimeters have several jacks used for this purpose.   One is usually labeled "COM" or (-), which stands for for common. This is where the black test lead will be connected. It will be used for nearly every measurement taken. The other jack or jacks should be labeled "V" (+) and the Omega symbol (an upside down horseshoe) for Volts and Ohms, respectively. The + and - symbols represent the polarity of probes when set for and testing DC volts. If the test leads were installed as suggested, the red lead would be positive as compared to the black test lead. This is nice to know when the circuit under test isn't labeled + or -, as is usually the case. Many meters have additional jacks that are required for current or high-voltage tests. It is equally important to have the test leads connected to the proper jacks as it is to have the selector switch range and test type (volts, amps, ohms) set. All must be correct. Consult the meter manual if you're unsure which jacks should be used.  There should be two test leads or probes. Generally, one is black and the other red. These are used to connect to whatever device you're planning on testing and measuring.  This is usually found on the back, but is also sometimes on the side of some models. This holds the fuse (and possibly a spare), and the battery that supplies power to the meter for resistance tests.   The meter may have more than one battery and they may be of different sizes. A fuse is provided to help protect the meter movement. Likewise, there is often more than one fuse. A good fuse is required for the meter to function, and fully charged batteries will be required for resistance/continuity tests.  This is a small knob usually located near the dial that is labeled "Ohms Adjust," "0 Adj," or something similar. This is used only in the ohms or resistance range, while the probes are shorted together (touching each other).   Rotate the knob slowly to move the needle as close to the 0 position on the Ohms scale as possible. If new batteries are installed, this should be easy to do - a needle that will not go to zero indicates weak batteries that should be replaced., Turn the meter on if it has a separate power switch. When multimeter measures resistance in ohms, it can not measure continuity because resistance and continuity are opposites. When there is little resistance, there will be a great deal of continuity, and vice versa. With this in mind, you can make assumptions about continuity based on the resistance values measured.   Find the Ohm scale on the dial. It is usually the top-most scale and has values that are highest on the left of the dial ("∞" or a sideways "8" for infinity), gradually reducing to 0 on the right. This is opposite of the other scales, which have the lowest values on the left and increase going right., If the test leads are not in contact with anything, the needle or pointer of an analog meter will rest at the left-most position. This represents an infinite amount of resistance, or an "open circuit." It's safe to say there is the no continuity, or path between the black and red probes.  Connect the black test lead to the jack marked "Common" or "-". Then, connect the red test lead to the jack marked with the Omega (Ohm symbol) or letter "R" near it.   Set the range (if provided) to R x 100.  The meter pointer should move fully to the right. Locate the "Zero Adjust" knob and rotate it so that the the meter indicates "0" (or as close to "0" as possible).   Note that this position is the "short circuit" or "zero ohms" indication for this R x 1 range of this meter. Always remember to "zero" the meter immediately after changing resistance ranges or you'll get a faulty reading. If you're unable to obtain a zero ohm indication, this may mean the batteries are weak and should be replaced. Retry the zeroing step above again with fresh batteries.  Locate the two electrical contact points of the bulb. They will be the threaded base and the center of the bottom of the base.   Have a helper hold the bulb by the glass only. Press the black probe against the threaded base and the red probe against the center tab on the bottom of the base. Watch the needle move from resting at the left and move quickly to 0 on the right.  Change the range of the meter to R x 1. Zero the meter again for this range and repeat the step above. Observe how the meter did not go as far to the right as before. The scale of resistance has been changed so that each number on the R scale can be read directly.   In the previous step, each number represented a value that was 100 times greater. Thus, 150 really was 15,000 before. Now, 150 is just 150. Had the R x 10 scale been selected, 150 would have been 1,500. The scale selected is very important for accurate measurements. With this understanding, study the R scale. It is not linear like the other scales. Values at the left side are harder to accurately read than those on the right. Trying to read 5 ohms on the meter while in the R x 100 range would look like 0. It would be much easier at the R x 1 scale instead. This is why when testing resistance, adjust the range so that the readings may be taken from the middle rather than the extreme left or right sides.  Set the meter to the highest R x value possible and zero the meter.   Loosely hold a probe in each hand and read the meter. Squeeze both probes tightly. Notice the resistance is reduced. Let go of the probes and wet your hands. Hold the probes again. Notice that the resistance is lower still.  It's very important that the probes not touch anything other than the device being tested. A device that has burned out will not show "open" on the meter when testing if your fingers provide an alternate path around the device, like when they are touching the probes.   Testing round cartridge type and older style glass automotive fuses will indicate low values of resistance if the fuse is lying on a metal surface when under test. The meter indicates the resistance of the metal surface that the fuse is resting upon (providing an alternate path between the red and black probe around the fuse) instead of trying to determine resistance through the fuse. Every fuse in this case, good or bad, will indicate "good," giving you a faulty analysis.  Many times, the voltage to be measured has a value that is unknown. For this reason, the highest range possible is selected so that the meter circuitry and movement will not be damaged by voltage greater than expected.   If the meter were set to the 50 volt range and a common U.S. electrical outlet were to be tested, the 120 volts present could irreparably damage the meter. Start high and work downward to the lowest range that can be safely displayed.  Insert the black probe in the "COM" or "-" jack. Next, insert the red probe in the "V" or "+" jack.  There may be several Volt scales with different maximum values. The range chosen by the selector knob determines which voltage scale to read.   The maximum value scale should coincide with selector knob ranges. The voltage scales, unlike the Ohm scales, are linear. The scale is accurate anywhere along its length. It will of course be much easier accurately reading 24 volts on a 50 volt scale than on a 250 volt scale, where it might look like it is anywhere between 20 and 30 volts.  In the US, you might expect 120 volts or even 240 volts. In other places, 240 or 380 volts might be expected.   Press the black probe into one of the straight slots. It should be possible to let go of the black probe, as the contacts behind the face of the outlet should grip the probe, much like it does when a plug is inserted. Insert the red probe into the other straight slot. The meter should indicate a voltage very close to 120 or 240 volts (depending on type outlet tested).  Rotate the selector knob to the lowest range offered that is greater than the voltage indicated (120 or 240).  The meter may indicate between 110 and as much as 125 volts this time. The range of the meter is important to obtain accurate measurements.   If the pointer did not move, it is likely that DC was chosen instead of AC. The AC and DC modes are not compatible. The correct mode must be set. If not set correctly, the user would mistakenly believe there was no voltage present, which could be a dangerous mistake. Be sure to try both modes if the pointer does not move. Set meter to AC volts mode, and try again.  Whenever possible, try to connect at least one probe in such a way that it will not be required to hold both while making tests. Some meters have accessories that include alligator clips or other types of clamps that will assist doing this. Minimizing your contact with electrical circuits drastically reduces that chances of sustaining burns or injury.  You need to determine whether or not the circuit is AC or DC by measuring the voltage of the circuit as described in previous steps.  If the circuit to be tested is AC but the meter will only measure DC amps (or vice versa), stop. The meter must be able to measure the same mode (AC or DC) amps as the voltage in the circuit, otherwise it will indicate 0.   Be aware that most multimeters will only measure extremely small amounts of current, in the uA and mA ranges. 1 uA is .000001 amp and 1 mA is .001 amp. These are values of current that flow only in the most delicate electronic circuits, and are literally thousands (and even millions) of times smaller than values seen in the home and automotive circuits that most homeowners would be interested testing. Just for reference, a typical 100W / 120V light bulb will draw .833 Amps. This amount of current would likely damage the meter beyond repair.  Ideal for the homeowner, this meter were to be used to measure current through a 4700 ohm resistor across 9 Volts DC.   To do this, insert the black probe into the "COM" or "-" jack and insert the red probe into the "A" jack. Shut off power to the circuit. Open the portion of the circuit that is to be tested (one lead or the other of the resistor). Insert the meter in series with the circuit such that it completes the circuit. An ammeter is placed in series with the circuit to measure current. It cannot be placed "across" the circuit the way a voltmeter is used (otherwise the meter will probably be damaged). Observe the polarity. Current flows from the positive side to the negative side. Set the range of current to the highest value. Apply power and adjust range of meter downward to allow accurate reading of pointer on the dial. Do not exceed the range of the meter, otherwise it may be damaged. A reading of about 2 milliamps should be indicated since from Ohm's law I = V / R = (9 volts)/(4700 Ω) = .00191 amps = 1.91 mA.  Even if the operating current is low and within the range of the meter fuse, the surge can be many times higher than the operating current, because the empty filter capacitors are almost like a short circuit. Blowing the meter fuse is almost certain if the DUT's (device under test) inrush current is many times higher than the fuses rating. In any case, always use the higher range measurement protected by the higher fuse rating and be careful.	Locate the dial of your multimeter. Find the selector switch, or knob. Locate the openings in the case where you'll insert the test leads. Locate the test leads. Find the battery and fuse compartment. Find the Zero Adjustment knob. Set the multimeter to Ohms or Resistance. Observe the meter indication. Connect the test leads. Hold the probes at the end of the test leads together. Measure the resistance of something like a light bulb that you know is good. Try different ranges. Test resistance between hands. Make sure your reading is accurate. Set the meter for the highest range provided for AC Volts. Insert your test probes. Locate the voltage scales. Test a common electrical outlet. Remove the probes. Reinsert the probes as previously. Try not to hold both. Make sure you've measured the voltage first. Set the meter to the highest AC or DC Amp range supported. Consider using a "clamp-on" ammeter. Be wary of any filter capacitors or other elements that require an inrush (surge) current when switched on.
You’ll want to use a strong paper, like cardstock, or a lightweight cardboard.   If you don’t want to go out and buy paper or cardboard, you can use a deconstructed cereal box or the cover of an old composition notebook, as these are an ideal weight. If you’re uncomfortable drawing antlers freehand, find a free template online to print out and use as a stencil.Make sure the sections of your design are wide enough that they will be easy to cut. Your design just needs to represent an antler shape. It doesn’t have to be completely accurate to nature. You want the antlers to be tall enough that they sit high above the head, but you don’t want them to be so large that they flop over. About 12” high is ideal, but feel free to customize and experiment. You can use identical antler shapes for both antlers. You’ll just make sure that you glue on onto your headband facing the opposite direction of the other. Only draw one of the antlers.; , Make sure to stay close to your lines. Cut slowly and carefully.   After you cut your first antler, use it as a template for the second. Place it on your paper or cardboard and trace around the edges. Cut out the second antler.  You’ll need more paper or cardboard to create this band. It doesn’t have to be exactly the same as the material you used for your antlers.   Wrap the edge of your paper or cardboard around the middle of your forehead until it reaches all the way around. Hold with your finger the place where the edges meet, and then mark this with a pencil on the paper. Mark again about another inch out from your first mark because you’ll want some overlap to attach the band. With this measurement, cut a band from your material. It should be about 2 inches wide, but you can make it wider if you want more space to decorate.  Brown is a typical color for antlers, but you can choose other colors you like more.   Use acrylic or craft paint. This gives a solid color and dries fairly quickly.When you paint your headband, only paint to the line you drew marking where the end should attach based on your head size. You want to leave a little unpainted space at the end of the band so you know where to attach it. After the paint dries, you can add fancy touches to your creation with accessories like glitter glue, sequins, stickers, or pom-poms.  After the paint dries, you’ll want to create your headband from the strip of paper or cardboard you cut out for it.   Use staples, glue, or tape, to fasten it together. Use your line as a guide for where to fasten it together. If you use glue, let the glue dry before you move on. Use a clothespin to hold the pieces together while the glue dries. Try it on. Put on your headband to make sure it fits comfortably and slides far enough onto your head but isn’t too loose.  You should connect the bottom of your antler pieces just slightly above the bottom of your headband.   Again, you can use staples, glue, or tape. If you use staples, place a small piece of duct tape across the staple on the inside of the headband so it doesn’t scrape the wearer. If you use glue, let it dry before wearing. Try placing the headband antler side down on a table and put small heavy objects, like paperweights, on top of the ends of the antlers to help them adhere as they dry.	Draw out your antler shape in pencil on paper or cardboard. Cut out your antlers. Create your headband. Paint the cardboard antlers and headband. Connect your headband. Attach your antlers to the headband.
Before applying a decal, you must determine the location on the car you want to place it. This is particularly important for large decals that may extend onto multiple body components, as you will need to plan for applications that extend over gaps.Assess the area you want the decal to be placed and determine if it will fit there.; , Hold the decal up against the vehicle to get a sense of how it will look and if it will fit in the area you’ve chosen. This will give you a sense of how the decal will look and the best placement for it.Leave the protective backing on the decal so it doesn’t stick as you hold it against the vehicle. Ensure the vehicle is dry before pressing the decal and backing into it.  While you can get a solid sense of where you’d like the decal by holding it up against the vehicle, using a tape measure can help to ensure you have it placed properly.If you are placing identical decals on either side, ensure they are an equal distance from at least three points on the body of the car to make the placement match on either side. Measure the distance from things like the trunk lid, door or window.  Once you’ve measured out exactly where you want the decal to sit, tear off small pieces of masking tape and place them at each corner of where the decal will be applied.The masking tape will serve as a guide when you begin applying the decal. Masking tape will not damage the paint on the vehicle.  Once you have the area the decal will be applied determined, use a soft cloth and a mild cleaner on the surface of the car. Rubbing alcohol will clean the area well and evaporate quickly, making it a common choice.Do not simply spray the cleaner onto the car or it may soak the masking tape you’ve used as a guide. Apply cleaner to a rag and wipe where the decal will stick to the car.  Some cleaners like Windex or spray on cleaner-waxes leave a residue intended to help maintain shine. This residue will prevent the decal from sticking properly to the vehicle.Rubbing alcohol or basic car wash soap both will clean the area sufficiently. Be sure to rinse the area thoroughly if you use car wash soap.  Decals won’t stick as well to a wet surface, so either dry the area you cleaned with a towel or allow it to air dry completely before moving on. If you opt to use a towel, use a chamois cloth to avoid damaging the paint.Wait for the surface to be completely dry before applying the decal.  Depending on the size of the decal, you may choose to remove the entire backing or just a portion of it at a time. If the decal is larger than your forearm, you may want to peel off the backing in thirds to make application more manageable.Decals that are only a few inches long can have the backing completely removed. Only peel off a bit of the backing at a time for larger decals such as ones that will stretch the length of the vehicle.  Use the tape on the car as a guide as you begin by applying the corner of the decal to the vehicle. Press the corner into the vehicle firmly, then use a straight edged tool such as a credit card to press more of the decal down in a controlled manner.Keep the decal pulled taught as you press it into the vehicle to prevent bubbling from occurring. Using a straight edged tool helps ensure you apply pressure over the entire decal, which will force out small bubbles.  As you apply more of the decal to the vehicle, peel more of the backing off to reveal more of the decal. Peel the backing off a few inches at a time to ensure you can keep the decal straight as you apply it without worrying about other parts sticking.Continue to apply the decal to the car while peeling back more of the backing as you progress.  While you may be able to remove the transfer tape immediately upon pressing the decal into the car, it’s best that you leave it to dry for a bit of time. Waiting 30 minutes can make removing the transfer tape much easier and reduce the chances that you’ll pull any of the decal off with it.Allowing the decal to sit in direct sunlight will make the transfer tape easier to remove. Do not attempt to speed up the process by using a heat source such a hair dryer, as it may melt the decal.  After thirty minutes or so, peel the transfer tape off starting at one corner. Peel the tape back slowly while watching for any areas the decal may peel back with the transfer tape. If the decal begins to peel off with the tape, press the tape and decal back into place firmly, and begin peeling the tape away again from another angle.Be careful not to tear the decal while removing the transfer tape. Slow, steady movements are the best way to prevent damage to the decal.  With the transfer tape removed, you will be able to see the decal on the vehicle. It is normal for there to be some bubbling in the decal. Some of those bubbles are easy to remove by pressing a credit card or other flat tool onto the decal and pushing the bubble toward the edge.Be careful not to press a sharp edge into the decal or it may tear it. Small bubbles will disappear on their own over the first few days.	Identify a location on the car for the decal. Place the decal on the vehicle to measure. Use a tape measure to help center the decal. Use pieces of masking tape to mark the location. Clean the area. Do not use any cleaner that leaves a film or oil on the car. Allow the cleaned area to dry completely. Peel off the beginning of the backing. Apply the corner of the exposed decal to the car. Unpeel the backing as you go. Leave the transfer tape on the decal while it dries in place. Peel the transfer tape off. Use a credit card to press out any bubbles.
, After a few thousand miles of this, most cars will turn on the "check engine" light. You can take it to any AutoZone, Advance auto parts, Napa, or O'Reilly's (but some places may only check cars made after 1996, so call and check first) and they will read the codes for free. There can be any number of reasons for the "check engine" light to come on, so it is good to check. Codes complaining of unexpected lean mixture is a good indication of O2 sensor failure. O2 sensors will typically last 60–75K miles. The good news is that you can buy an O2 sensor on-line for around $50 and they are generally pretty easy to replace. Another possible reason is that the engine is idling too low (the idle is adjustable) or the control module is going out, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to access and fix.	Look for initial idle OK after a cold engine start-up, but a warm engine idle will surge and stall.  , Take your car in to get a reading.
At intersections with traffic lights or stop signs, obey the signals! This simple step is the easiest way to stay out of trouble. You don’t have to worry about right of way because the traffic light is calculating it for you. Just stay in your lane and wait until the light turns green. That means you are allowed to go. A blinking red light means that you should treat the stoplight as a stop sign. Stop, yield to others already at the intersection, and then continue on your way. If you arrive at the intersection at the same time as another person, the car to the right goes first. A blinking yellow light means proceed with caution. You should go slow, and there may be a crosswalk ahead. Yield to anyone in the crosswalk. You must yield to emergency vehicles with their lights on even if you have a green light.  If you see a sign saying "no right on red" then you must wait for the light to turn green again. Similarly, if there is a red arrow pointing right inside the stop light, you must wait for the light to turn green. You are never allowed to turn right on red in New York City.  If you and another car arrive at the intersection at the same time, then yield to the car to the right. It isn’t always easy to determine who arrived at the intersection first, so try to make eye contact with the other driver. This will help you establish who is going to go first. Flashing your lights is an indication that you want them to go first. If they flash their lights at you, that means they are waiting for you to go. , When a one- or two-lane road intersects with a larger road, the driver on the smaller road must yield to cars on the multi-lane road. Wait for a safe opening in the traffic before you try to enter into the multi-lane road. Never expect the traffic to stop for you. If you have to come to a complete stop before entering the multi-lane road, that’s okay.  When a road dead-ends into a through street, the driver on the dead-end road must yield to traffic on the other street. You don’t want to go driving out into oncoming traffic. Oftentimes these intersections will have a stop sign, but if not yield right of way to oncoming traffic.	Follow the signal directions at controlled intersections. Turn "right on red" at a stoplight if there is no sign telling you otherwise. Yield to cars already at an uncontrolled intersection. Yield to the larger road at intersections with multiple-lane roads. Yield to oncoming traffic at T-intersections. Treat the traffic light like a stop sign if it is not functioning.
After 9/11 many American families have created special emergency kits to help them survive in the event of another tragedy. Regardless of the threat, an emergency supply kit can help you to stay alive during the early days following an outbreak or disaster. Items you should include:   Water. One gallon per person per day. If it’s possible, maintain at least a three day supply. Non-perishable food. Choose food that is easy to open, easy to store that does not attract bugs (or zombies). Also, select items that provide enough calories and nutrition to sustain life for several hours such as energy bars, peanut butter and nuts. If you have a baby, maintain a week’s supply of formula or baby food. Since you probably won’t be able to run your dishwasher, keep a pack of plastic forks, spoons, paper plates, paper towels and plastic cups on hand. Prescription and non prescription medication. Since you can’t anticipate when a disaster or zombie attack could possibly happen, always keep an extra month’s supply of prescription medicine on-hand. Non prescription medicine should include pain relievers, antihistamines and anti-diarrhea medication. First aid kit. You don't want to be bleeding all over the place regardless if you are running from zombies or trying to survive a natural or man-made disaster. Pack bandages of all sizes, blister bandages and a few ACE bandages. Include antibacterial cream to avoid infection. Toiletries. Most likely your electricity will be disconnected, so maintaining supplies that will keep you clean (and smelling fresh) will be vital to your survival. Include deodorant, waterless shampoo and antibacterial waterless hand soap. If you have a baby, don’t forget diapers and wipes. Tools. Put yourself in the shoes of a Boy Scout and think about the tools you might need to survive in the wilderness. Pocket knives, duct tape, flashlights, bleach, batteries, candles, matches and a hammer are a good place to start. Pet supplies. Don’t forget about the family pet. Same rules apply to Fido in terms of food, water and medication. Generator and gas. In the event you lose electricity following a disaster, keep a few cans of gas in the garage and have your generator primed and ready to go at any minute. Test your generator every year to ensure it’s still in working order and have it flushed after each use.; , Chances are you will be taken by surprise during a disaster of zombie-like proportions and in order to stay one step ahead, gather the troops and have a “what if” discussion. Review the family’s daily schedule and identify a “go to” safe spot in the event of a disaster like a zombie attack. Determine how you could come together as a family once the area has been deemed safe or cleared. Could you walk home if necessary or will you require car, bus or train transportation? If you typically ride public transportation and there is no way you can walk home, identify a peer who has a car and find out if you could get a ride, should disaster strike. You should also consider what to do if you can’t locate a member of your family. Who will be elected to go on the search and when? Ultimately your best bet would be to communicate by cell phone, however you can’t depend on the network to be up and running--that’s why a solid emergency plan is imperative.  During emergency situations, "good" people can do terrible things. In addition to having to worry about the usual dangers lurking outside, anarchist looters may try to move in and take what’s rightfully yours. Think about what it will take to secure your home and personal property from harm’s way.   Examine all locks on windows and doors. Do you have any doors or windows that don’t close properly or are broken? Have all entryways to your home evaluated by a professional to ensure that no one could forcefully enter your home? Lock cars and secure recreational toys such as motorcycles, boats and jet skis. Bring in outdoor items that could be used as weapons or could become air born. Looters (or angry zombies) could use items such as large potted plants and lawn furniture to smash windows. Also, during a hurricane or tornado, those items could become flying "missiles" and create endless amounts of damage.  Every disaster situation is different and hopefully government agencies are communicating with the public every step of the way. However, during the early days following an outbreak or disaster the public is often on their own. Examine your unique situation and consider the safest way to conduct yourself until help arrives.   Look for dangerous patterns within the community. If you know that you will be in the most danger at night, don’t go outside at that time. Be hyper-aware of your surroundings and never let your guard down while in public or outside. Make your trips into the community brief. In addition to being worried about being eaten during a zombie attack, most disasters will wreak havoc on structures--power lines may be down and on the ground and building materials may line the street. You could actually survive the disaster but then be electrocuted because you didn’t see the downed power line on the sidewalk. Practice safe behavior. If you could become infected with a deadly disease or be attacked on the street, don’t spend your day hanging out in the town’s square. Use your common sense and make every effort to avoid trouble.  From national to local government agencies; many have planned for a variety of disaster scenarios and should have a hardwired plan ready for implementation. Stay informed by trying to contact your local officials first and then state and national groups if you don’t get answers immediately.  You don’t have to be suspicious of the little old lady down the street, but it’s good to know which neighbors will have your back. Keep a list of emergency friends and family members near your emergency kit. You may want to have a discussion or an agreement with neighbors before disaster strikes to know how you can help each other.	Stock up on emergency supplies. Have an emergency family plan. Secure your property. Know what you are up against. Have emergency names and numbers on-hand. Know who you can trust.
Many believe neem oil, which comes from a bitter tree leaf, to be one of the most effective natural pesticides in existence.  Stir slowly but thoroughly.  Use it immediately, dousing the entire plant and focusing on spots where you can clearly see pests or signs of pests.	Combine 1/2 ounce (15 milliliters) of neem oil with 1/2 teaspoon (2 1/2 milliliters) mild soap. Mix the neem and soap into 2 quarts (2 liters) of warm water. Pour the pesticide into a spray bottle.
Alternatively, grow the plant from seed in spring to obtain really good flowering plants.   This plant can also be propagated by cuttings.; ,, A sunny windowsill is ideal or a south-facing room (northern hemisphere) or a north-facing room (southern hemisphere). Avoid growing the plant in conditions under 10ºC.  Don't over-water or water log it though; the soil should be evenly moist and well draining.   Mist the foliage regularly if the humidity is below 50 percent and use a pebble tray to stand the plant on.  Use a general liquid fertiliser.  It's not likely to provide as good a show of flowers the next year that it is grown unless you feed and water it regularly.   If keeping, repot it in the spring.	Purchase a plant from the local nursery or garden centre. Use a soil-based compost in the pot.  , Place the Madagascar periwinkle in bright light or direct sunlight. Water regularly. Feed every 14 days from early spring to autumn (fall). Consider whether to overwinter it or to treat it as an annual.
If anybody is missing, only re-enter the building if it is safe to do so. Tell the first responders immediately on their arrival if you are afraid somebody is missing. Likewise, if everybody is accounted for, let the fire responders know so that they're not sending people in endangering their lives looking for others.  Call 911 in North America, 000 in Australia, 111 in New Zealand and 999 in the UK or 112 from your mobile (this number has priority on the mobile phone network in the UK as too many 999 calls are made unintentionally) 112 is the emergency number in all of Europe and will be directed to the local emergency number by the network if necessary. Use your cellphone or call from a neighbor's house.  After making the call and the resources are coming, it is time to check yourself and family members to make sure that there are no injuries. If there are, do what you can to address that and when the fire department arrives, you can ask for directions and help.  Keep a safe distance between you and the fire. Take the necessary measures after the house fire to be safe.	Do a head count. Call your local emergency services number. Do an injury assessment. Get away from the structure.
Valve stem replacement tool kits come with an insertion tube that should be placed over the valve stem hole with the larger opening facing up. Make sure the tube is correctly aligned with the hole; if it is even slightly misaligned it will stop you from inserting the new valve stem.You can purchase valve stem replacement tool kits at your local auto parts store. The insertion tube will guide the new valve stem as you press it into place.  Take the new valve stem and cover it in an automotive lubricant designed to create a seal once the valve stem is in place. The lubricant will make it easier to insert the valve stem through the valve stem hole.You can purchase tire sealant lubricant at your local auto parts store. You may be able to insert the valve stem without lubricant, but the seal will be stronger if you use it.  Insert the valve stem top first into the insertion tool that resembles a screw driver, then slide the stem and tool into the insertion tube. With one swift motion, press the valve stem down through the tube and hole in the rim, then pull back up to pull the top of the stem through the wheel.You will need to thread the valve stem onto the insertion tool so you can pull it back up once inserted. You may need to apply a good deal of pressure to get the stem through the hole.  Just as you swiftly pressed the stem through the hole, now pull backward on the handle in one swift motion to pull the majority of the valve stem back through it. The bottom ring of the valve stem will prevent it from passing all the way back through, properly seating the valve stem.If you accidentally pull the stem all the way back through, repeat the process to reinsert it. You can now refill the tire and place it back on the vehicle.	Place the insertion tube over the valve stem hole. Lubricate the new valve stem. Press the valve stem into the tire with one quick motion. Pull up on the insertion tool with a strong jerk.
By keeping your back straight and gluteus muscles tensed, you’ll be able to control the movement of air through your lungs and into the mouthpiece. Adjust your posture as necessary to allow your lungs to fill fully with air. Relax your core and rely on your lungs to provide the necessary breath support., Warming up before a run stretches muscles and prevents soreness, and your trumpet warm up performs the same function. Play a number of long, low tones. Gradually, work your way up the scale playing notes and holding them. Once your lips are warm, move on to playing scales quickly. Slur up and tongue down. Accelerate your tempo as your repeat the scale to begin warming up your fingers as well., Once you’re warm, use a chromatic tuner to make sure your C on the staff, the traditional trumpet tuning note, is on pitch. If you’re playing with a group, tune to one instrument to ensure the ensemble sounds good together. If your instrument is sharp, move the tuning slide in. If your instrument is flat, push the tuning slide out. Repeat the tuning C, until you’re able to play in tune at least three times in a row., If you practice for an hour each day, only six minutes of your practice should focus on reaching higher notes. This may seem like a relatively small amount, but the easier your low and mid register notes are to hit, the simpler your high notes will be. Improve your overall skill, and your high range will improve with it., This makes high notes easier. A good rule of thumb is that however difficult a C on the scale is to play a C above the scale will be twice as hard. Thus, the easier it is to play a tuning C, the easier it will be to play your high C., Once you’ve developed your skill using a beginners or deep mouthpiece, you may want to switch to a more shallow option. While it may be tempting to depend on a shallow mouthpiece to help you play higher notes from the beginning, it’s essential that you learn to rely on your embouchure combined with the speed of air to hit high notes rather than your mouthpiece. However, some mouthpieces can make hitting the right notes easier.	Sit or stand with the correct posture. Take time to warm up completely. Tune your instrument. Designate ten percent of practice to range extension. Learn to play midrange notes effortlessly. Change your mouthpiece.
It is important to make sure that the edge of your fabric is even and not frayed. Use a pair of sharp scissors to trim along the edge of your fabric as needed.To ensure a straight edge, you may want to trim about 1/8 to 1/4 inch of fabric from the edge before you begin sewing the rolled hem.; , It is important to use a needle and thread that are appropriate for the type of fabric you are sewing. Rolled edges are popular with delicate projects like scarves and handkerchiefs, so you may want to use a fine needle and fine thread.   Try using a straw needle in size 11 with some delicate thread.Thread the needle by inserting the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. Tie a couple of knots at the end of the thread to anchor it in place when you begin sewing.  To secure your thread and hide the knot, insert the needle into the wrong side of the fabric. Push the needle through near the corner of the fabric. After you fold down the fabric and complete your first few stitches, the knot will be hidden.Some sewers do not recommend knotting the thread to secure it out of concern for the fabric. Instead, they recommend allowing the stitches to hold the thread in place.If you are concerned about the knot damaging your fabric, then you can try starting the stitch without a knot. You will just need to take care not to let the end of the thread pull through. After several stitches, your thread should be secured.  Next, fold over the edge of your fabric by about 1/8 of an inch. There is no need to secure it in place with pins, which may damage delicate fabric. However, it is a good idea to crease the fabric, such as by pressing the edge with an iron.Keep in mind that pressing with an iron is optional. You can also crease the edge with your fingers or use a coin to crease the edge if ironing is not an option. Be careful when creasing or pressing delicate fabric. You may want to lay a piece of scrap fabric over the fabric and crease or iron through the extra fabric to protect it.  Your thread should be coming out of the right side of the fabric from securing the knot. Bring the needle up and over the top of the folded edge and then insert the needle near the bottom of the raw edge.The needle does not need to go all the way through the fabric. It is okay if you just catch a few threads., Next, insert the needle near the top edge of the fold.This is the second stitch location for the rolled hem stitch.   After you go through the top, go back through the bottom again. Repeat this pattern about every 1/4 inch (1cm). Continue to alternate between stitching at the bottom and top of the fold for three to five stitches. These two stitches work together to create the rolled hem.  After you have completed three to five stitches, you can tug the thread to roll the hem. Gently tug on the thread to tighten the stitches. By tugging on the thread, you will be pulling the two edges together and this is what creates the rolled hem.Tug the thread to tighten the stitches about every three to five stitches. Continue to stitch and tug until your project is complete.	Trim any uneven edges or hanging threads. Thread a needle. Insert the needle into the corner of the fabric. Fold over the edge of your fabric. Insert the needle into fabric just below the raw edge. Go through the fabric near the top edge of the fold. Pull the thread after about three to five stitches.
Using a plunger to remove a dent works best on large, shallow dents in flat components of the body like the door or hood. Whether you use a toilet plunger or an automotive one designed for dent pulling, no plunger can remove creases from steel, they can only pop dents back out.If the dent is smaller than a quarter, a plunger likely will not resolve it. The flatter the body panel, the better the plunger method will work.; , You can actually use a toilet plunger with a similar level of effectiveness for this method as you can a dent removing plunger purchased from an auto parts store. Plungers designed for dent removal may have a higher success rate with more difficult dents.Use a clean plunger to avoid getting any kind of debris on the paint of your vehicle. Automotive plungers are often quite a bit more expensive than toilet plungers.  Use a bit of water and a rag to moisten the suction surface of the plunger. This will allow it to create a seal against the vehicle, which will enable you to pull up on the plunger to suck the metal back into shape.Make sure to use clean, plain water to avoid damaging the paint.  If the dent is larger than the circumference of the plunger, start on the edges of the dent. If it is smaller than the plunger, place the plunger directly over the dent. Press the plunger into the vehicle.You may need to repeat the process from multiple angles on larger dents. When placing the plunger along the side of the dent, ensure the plunger is over both the dented and undented area.  Pull backward on the plunger in short, jerking motions just as you might when plunging a toilet. The plunger may pop off before the dent is removed, so prepare yourself to re-moisten the plunger and start again.It may take multiple tries to suck a dent back out of the metal. Short, quick motions will yield the best results when sucking dents out of steel.	Assess the size and location of the dent. Purchase a clean plunger. Moisten the rubber edge on the plunger. Position the plunger over the dent and press into the vehicle. Pull out on the plunger repeatedly.
If you’re new to this trend and haven’t played around with metallics before, don’t go big right away. Try adding a few small pieces to a room first, just to get a feel for how it works in your home – and to confirm you like metallic décor! Adding a metallic gold vase as a table centerpiece or hanging up a mirror with bronze trim are examples of ways you can add a bit of bling to your space without feeling overwhelmed., If you aren’t a professional interior decorator, you might not have a grand vision for your space. That’s OK! You can always buy a few items that can work in several places around your home, and you can play around with them. Look for pieces that can work in your bedroom or your living room, or the bathroom or the kitchen. You can move things around and experiment.A metallic picture frame is a small touch that can add a lot to a space, but can also work in virtually any space. The same goes for metallic lamps, trays, bowls, and so on.  If you aren’t ready to fully embrace this trend yet, why not purchase a few temporary metallic accessories? For example, consider using fun golds and silvers in your holiday or seasonal décor. You can find festive throw pillows, table settings, display trinkets, and so on. If you still love the metallic trend when the season or holiday ends, you can get some décor that is more permanent.  If you don't want to fill your home with various metallic pieces, or simply only have one metallic piece that interests you, why not just use it solo to make a statement? Whether it's a metallic tea tray on your coffee table or one metallic piece of art on your mantle, one statement piece will draw the eye immediately. You don't need to add metallics to every corner of the room to embrace this trend in your home.  After all, not all metallics are created equal. A shiny, smooth gold will create a different effect in a room than a hammered gold. Any metallic with an antiqued finish will look darker and older, and a metallic with a brushed finish will be more matte. If you’re not interested in traditional gold or silver, don’t overlook copper and bronze décor! Also, don’t be afraid to mix and match metallics to create a lot of interest.Again, if you aren’t sure which one you’ll prefer over time in your home, try out a few smaller, temporary pieces! You can get an idea for your personal preference without committing to anything or shelling out a lot of cash. Don’t buy a certain type of metallic simply because it’s recommended with your color palette or someone suggested it. Choose a metallic that you personally love, and you won’t get sick of it., If your space needs a makeover, try heading to Pinterest before heading to Home Goods. You can also find decorating ideas from interior design magazines and websites. Even if you have experience decorating your home, it never hurts to check out what other people are doing. You can see how the professionals are using metallics in homes, and you might discover combinations or ideas that you never considered.  Giving your own furniture or décor a metallic makeover is a great way to save a little money and extend the life of your belongings. Instead of tossing that plain wooden dresser you’re sick of, give it a makeover. A coat of black or white paint with some metallic knobs or accents will make it look like a whole new piece. The same goes for old chairs, tables, desks, and so on. You can find metallic spray paints in every hue at a home improvement store., To bring balance to the room you’re decorating, it’s a great idea to pair opposites. In other words, try blending your metallic décor with soft fabrics. A vibrant gold bowl placed on a faux fur place mat creates a beautiful contrast. Adding a metallic throw pillow to a soft velvet armchair strikes that same balance.Not only do these pairings create balance, but they also allow the metallic element to really stand out.  Using metallics to decorate your home is a pretty bold choice, and it’s typically best to let those elements be the focal point. In order to do this, try to keep the rest of the room fairly neutral. Pair your metallics with colors like gray, white, cream, black, and so on. Not only is this extremely modern and on trend, it’s also much more welcoming and “livable.”Pairing some already flashy metallic décor with colors like hot pink or electric blue is certainly a bold choice, but you’re likely to get a bit sick of it after awhile.  The other tips have alluded to it, but the key to using metallic in your home décor is to let those pieces have the spotlight. By keeping the rest of your décor neutral, soft, and simplistic, you’ll ensure that your space doesn’t become overwhelming. For example, if there’s a metallic coffee table that you love, go for it! Just keep the couch and rug neutral, and let that table have the spotlight.   The added bonus of keeping your spaces pretty neutral is that you will be able to swap different metallic pieces in and out as you like!	Start small. Purchase versatile items. Try out things that aren’t permanent. Use one metallic statement piece. Consider the different types of metallics. Gather inspiration from the professionals. Repurpose things you already own. Pair metallics with soft fabrics. Use a neutral color palette. Let the metallics have the spotlight.
You will be using symbols to indicate vocal mics from instrument mics, DI boxes, monitors etc. Both you and whomever is reading your stage plot need to know what all of these symbols mean. There are no official standards for stage plot symbols.; , Outline, in pencil, the general area where each band member normally sets up. Keep in mind that a stage plot should be drawn from the audience point of view looking at the stage NOT from the band's point of view as this is likely to confuse the sound tech.  Supposing that you have a keyboard player in your band who sets up down-stage-right plays an electronic piano and a synthesizer and sings some backup vocals, you should indicate in the lower left hand side of the stage plot a vocal mic, two DI boxes, three electrical outlets, a keyboard amp and a monitor   NOTE: it's a good idea to specify that of these two DI boxes one is for the synthesizer and one is for the piano  ,, Once you have everybody's stuff on your stage plot you are in a position to know how many vocal mics you are going to need in total, how many DI boxes, how many monitor mixes and so on. It is good to list each of these as well as a total channel count at the bottom of the stage plot so that anybody looking at it can quickly determine what size of mixer you require, how many microphones, DI Boxes etc. they will need to provide.	Create a legend for your stage plot. Draw Stations. Within each outline fill in the requirements of each band member. Repeat for each band member.  , Count everything.
The cost of heating your home can take a big bite out of your paycheck very quickly. (If you’ve moved from a very warm or hot region, you’re probably familiar with what air conditioning can do to a utility bill. This is the same; in reverse.)   Add more insulation to your attic, if you have one. Heat rises, and will escape through a poorly insulated attic. Fiberglass insulation comes in rolls with paper backing that you can roll and tack up to winterize your home. Caulk cracks around windows and doors to eliminate drafts. Use water resistant caulk on the outside of buildings. Add weather stripping to doors and windows when winterizing buildings. Install outlet gaskets to electric outlets located on outer walls. The gaskets will eliminate drafts when you prepare your house for winter. Clean your furnace, if you have one, and replace the air filter. Dirty air filters clog the flow of air and could start a fire. Service your wood burning stove. Have a professional chimney sweep come out to clean and inspect your wood stove when preparing your house for winter. Close off rooms that are not in use. Try to confine areas in your home that don’t require heating.; , Have 1 window installed at a time if you can't afford to have them done all at once. Double-paned windows will help winterize your home.  Leaves and other debris will clog your gutters, which could create an ice dam on your roof.  When preparing your house for winter, you need to protect water pipes and prevent them from freezing and bursting.   Heating tape is an electrical wire that attaches to a thermostat to keep your exposed pipes heated to a specific temperature. Read manufacturer's directions when installing insulation products to winterize your home, and remember, if you use heating tape, you will need to connect it to electricity.  Closing the vents will help winterize your home. However, you should never block roof vents, chimneys, flues, dryer exhausts, or plumbing vent stacks.  If you don't have storm or double paned windows, you may put plastic on the windows when winterizing buildings.   Obtain winter plastic wrap and weather tape if you don't have storm or double pane windows. Cut the plastic wrap with a utility knife to fit your window frame. Use weather tape to secure the plastic to the inside of your window frame. Apply heat with a hair dryer to shrink the plastic wrap when winterizing buildings.  In the hot summer months, the fans are tilted to provide an air conditioning effect, and in the winter, you can turn the fan in the other direction to circulate the warm air.  For sleeping attire; get out your “longies” and flannel pajamas. Keep a robe handy to your bed for use when you get up. Put your flip-flops in the closet and get out some slippers with a sole and a warm lining. Wear heavier socks. Winter months mean storing your T-shirts and shorts away and switching to sweats, lightweight but warm sweaters with long sleeves. (Keep a couple of those T-shirts on hand to wear as an undergarment.) Invest in thermal undergarments.  A hot breakfast versus cereal with cold milk can make a big difference. Oatmeal, eggs and toast, pancakes or waffles or even a bowl of soup will take you farther. (Sprinkle some freshly made popcorn over a bowl of tomato soup for breakfast or lunch. It’s a treat that will help keep you warm.) Keep your carbs up. Hot pasta dishes, a stove-top stew of potatoes and chunky vegetables are great tummy warmers. (Afraid of added weight? Your body will burn those carb calories keeping you warm. Or get out there and move some snow; it’s great exercise.)  , Down-filled bedding is pricey, but well worth the investment. Consider flannel sheets and/or a quilt.  This will prevent them from bursting or leaking during the winter.  Use an air compressor to force water out of the pipes. This will prevent freezing.  If it is not, water could enter your basement/crawlspace when the snow melts. , Doing so can help prevent lawn damage.  Keep it within reach of anyone over three feet of height. Your kit should include:   Flashlights and batteries Candles and a lighter or plenty of matches. (Wrap them in a plastic bag to help keep them dry) You might have a battery operated lamp or an oil lamp. (Do not store an oil lamp with oil in it. Keep this flammable liquid tightly sealed and separate until you need to use it.) A battery operated radio Foodstuffs – Keep foods on hand that can be eaten cold. Canned fruit Canned meats such as tuna or shredded beef Cereals that can be eaten dry Chocolate bars or a couple bags of chocolate chips Plenty of water A small, propane operated camping stove and at least two extra canisters of propane. Be sure to operate this according to the manufacturer's instructions.(Do not use a charcoal-type camping or cooking unit indoors!)	Start winterizing buildings in the summer. Consider installing double-paned windows in your home. Clean out your rain gutters in the fall after the leaves have fallen. Wrap pipes in unheated locations, such as crawl spaces beneath your house or in your garage, with foam insulation, pipe wrap or heat tape. Close outside vents to your house as soon as it starts to get cold. Install storm windows, if you have them. Reverse the direction of your ceiling fan, if you have one. Adjust your wardrobe. Eat right. Add another blanket to the bed. Disconnect, drain, and store any garden hoses. Shut off your sprinkler system, if you have one. Be sure that you lawn is properly graded away from your home. Use stakes to mark important locations in your yard, such as septic system keys, water meters, and in-ground electrical/irrigation boxes.  , If you have a driveway plowing service, use stakes to mark the edges of your driveway. Prepare an “emergency” kit, keep it well-stocked and educate everyone in your household where it will be stored.
On a piece of graph paper, draw a vertical line to represent the position of Jupiter. Make a large dot representing Jupiter on the vertical line you drew, then skip several lines down and make another large dot. Proceed to make Jupiter dots for as many days as you’ll be making observations, and label each area with a date or day of the week.   Once you’ve drawn your Jupiter dots, go to the first one and plot the moons relative to the vertical line. For example, graph the moon that’s closest to Jupiter one line to the left or right of the Jupiter dot, depending on what you observe. Graph the next closest moon two lines away from the dot. You can number the moons by brightness, or if you’d like, you can cross check them with your Jupiter mobile app and color code them using colored pencils.  While seven to nine days will give you usable data, making observations for a month more will increase the accuracy of your measurements. Each dot you drew will help you make your graph for that day, so on the second day of your observations, plot the moons relative to the second Jupiter dot.   Be sure to continue to use your labeling or color coding system to keep track of each moon. If you cannot observe on a certain day, skip the graph for that day.  Draw a line to connect each moon’s daily positions. When you do this correctly, you trace out a wave pattern, called a sine wave. Now you have a graph of the moon's positions over time. You can even use this pattern to predict the moons' positions over several years!	Graph the moons. Repeat this observation for at least a week. Connect the observations with a line.
You will be using the oven's heat to set the curl in the ribbon., Choose a 3/8-inch (9.5-millimeter) wide grosgrain ribbon and a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter dowel. Wrap the ribbon in a spiral around the dowel. Secure both ends of the ribbon to the dowel with wooden clothespins.#* The edges of the ribbon can touch, but don't let them overlap. The closer together the wraps are, the tighter your curls will be. The further apart they are, the looser the curls will be.Choose a dowel that is about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long.. This ensures that it will fit on your baking sheet.  This will give you a nice, full korker bow.For an extra-full bow, you could make 6 more dowels. You can use the same color of ribbon for each dowel, or experiment with different colors and patterns.  Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set the dowels down onto the baking sheet. Don't let the ribbon part touch the sheet, or the ribbon may scorch.   Some people find that dampening the ribbons with water helps the ribbons hold their curl better., As the ribbons bake, they will conform to the shape of the dowel, and hold their curl. If you want crisper curls, spray the ribbons with clothing starch just after you take them out of the oven., Pull off the clothespins first. In most cases, you should be able to slide the curls off of the dowels. If you can't, carefully unwind them. The ribbons should spring back into shape.  Cut them at angles by keeping your scissors parallel to the ribbons. This way, the ends of the ribbon will be angled and not stick out randomly. You want a total of 30 to 36 curls., This will help prevent fraying. The easiest way to do this is to hold the ends over a flame for a few seconds. If you are nervous around fire, you can use fray check instead.   Use a tea light or a pillar candle as your flame source. They are sturdy and less likely to tip over. Keep a bowl or cup of water nearby in case of accidents.  Something between 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) long would be ideal.Orient the elastic horizontally.   If you can't find thin elastic, a piece of string or thread would also do.  Orient them vertically so that they lay across the elastic. You can pile them in whatever order you want, but make sure that they are even on both ends.  Pull both ends of the elastic together, then overlap them and tie them into a tight knot. The ribbon curls will gather in the center, and flare out at the ends.  There is a chance that some ends of the ribbons ended up shorter/longer than others. If this happened, gently tug on the shorter ends until they are all the same length., The square knot is very similar to a double knot, but instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse it. Cross the left elastic over the right, and tie it into a knot. Cross the right elastic over the left, and tie it into a second knot., The ribbon needs to be twice the length of your clip, plus an extra 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You will be covering the top of your clip, then folding the rest of the ribbon instead. The excess ribbon will cover the clasp. You can use any color of ribbon you want for this, but it needs to be the same width as your clip., While not completely necessary, this will help keep your ribbon from fraying. Hold one end of the ribbon over a flame until the end melts. Repeat for the other end. , Turn your clip so that the top is facing away from you. Pinch the clip open. Run a line of hot glue along the underside of the top piece. Quickly press the ribbon into the glue.  Turn your clip so that the top is facing you. Run a line of hot glue along the top piece. Press the ribbon into the glue.  Turn the clip so that the bottom is facing you. Place a dot of glue on the bottom edge, on the same side that the clasp is on. Fold the ribbon over the clasp and press the end into the glue. This will cover the clasp on the back of the clip.If there is any ribbon that did not get glued down, secure it with more hot glue.  Make a small mound of hot glue in the center of your clip. Find the side of your bow with the square knot, and press it into the glue.	Preheat your oven to 250ºF (122ºC). Wrap the ribbon around the dowel in a spiral. Make 4 to 5 more dowels. Place the wrapped dowels onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the ribbons for 20 minutes. Allow the ribbons to cool before removing them. Cut the ribbons to 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long. Seal the ends of the ribbons. Set a piece of thin elastic down on the table. Pile the ribbon curls on top of the elastic. Tie the elastic into a tight knot. Adjust the ends of the ribbon if necessary. Flip the bow over and tie the elastic into a square knot. Cut a piece of grosgrain ribbon to cover your alligator clip. Heat seal both ends of the ribbon. Glue the ribbon to the inside of your clip. Glue the rest of the ribbon to the top of your clip. Fold the ribbon over the back of the clip and secure it with glue. Glue the bow to the top of the clip.
Your head is perhaps the single most important part of your body to protect in a riot. Batons, rubber bullets, rocks, and fists can all cause permanent damage if they strike you in the head. Even weapons that aren't meant to be shot directly into protesters, like tear gas canisters, can (and have) caused major injuries and deaths this way.To protect against critical head injuries, wear a sturdy helmet. Rioters are known to protect themselves with:   Bike helmets Motorcycle helmets Hard hats/construction helmets Sports helmets/headwear Police/military surplus helmets; , Generally, you won't want to be caught in a riot in your shorts and sandals. The more skin covered, the better, as many anti-riot weapons, like pepper spray, rubber bullets, and so on, are most effective against bare skin. However, you won't necessarily want to wear clothing that's prohibitively heavy or bulky, as, often, the best defense against danger is simply to run away. Below is just one sample outfit that you might want to consider:   Heavy but well-fitting jeans that you can run in. Tee-shirt or undershirt. Long-sleeved overshirt of heavy cloth or flannel. Tough jacket (sturdy leather or cloth works well. Scarf (optional)  , While it's important to dress to protect yourself, you won't want to commit too heavily to the outfit you're wearing during a riot. Try to wear clothing you can easily remove if the need arises (and that you won't miss if you have to abandon it.) Being able to slip out of an outer garment quickly can have some major advantages. For instance:   It can allow you to slip out of someone's grasp. It can allow you to escape noxious chemicals (like tear gas and pepper spray) that have seeped in to your clothes. It can allow you to easily "cool down" during breaks in the action when you get a chance to rest.  If you have a chance to visit a sporting goods store, protective pads and guards can be very helpful in a riot. Though not quite as heavy-duty as the gear riot police are likely to wear, they can often prevent scrapes and bruises and may even offer limited protection against batons and rubber bullets. Commonly-available pads that you may want to consider wearing are:   Shin guards (soccer/football, hockey) Knee guards (skating) Thigh/hip guards (American football) Elbow/wrist pads (skating)  , For obvious reasons, it's a good idea to wear a cup to a riot if you're a man. Don't forget this seemingly minor addition to your riot gear — it can be a lifesaver.  As noted above, often, your best defense in a riot is simply to get away from sources of danger — in fact, even die-hard anarchist resources often prioritize a rioter's need to stay mobile over his ability to resist physical damage.This is much easier to do if you're wearing shoes that allow you to run at a sprint. Try to wear at least reasonably tough athletic shoes or boots that are worn-in and comfortable.   Heavier boots (like police or military surplus options) can offer additional protection but may make it hard to run if you're not used to them.  If you find that it doesn't impede your ability to move, you may want to add strips or plates of hard protective material under your clothing to protect you from the hazards of rocks, rubber bullets, fists, batons, tasers, and so on. To attach these makeshift pieces of armor, stick them to the inside of your clothing with sturdy tape or string strips together with cloth to make a wearable "apron." Suitable materials may include:   Sheet metal Thick, hard plastic (PVC, etc.) Tough leather Kevlar or other tough fibers	Protect your head with a helmet. Cover yourself with strong (yet mobile) clothing. Wear easy-to-shed layers. Wear sports pads to protect your limbs. If you're male, wear a cup. Wear shoes that allow you to run. Consider wearing sheets of protective material under your clothes.
, For granular, sub-angular blocky, and angular blocky structures, it helps to remove the sample with a knife and then proceed to break up the sample gently in your fist.  If the soil is single-grained or massive, it receives a grade of zero. If the units of structure are barely observable, a grade of one (weak) is assigned, if the units are observable without removing them from the pit, the grade is three (strong), and if neither of these are the case, the soil has a structural grade of two (moderate).  These are the colors either lighter or darker than the soil matrix color. Describe whether they are concentrations or depletions, the degree to which they contrast with the soil matrix, and estimate their concentration for each horizon.	Gather any samples you may not have had time to collect in the first session.  , Insert your soil knife into the pit face and observe how the soil naturally breaks along planes of weakness in each horizon. Assign a value, zero through three, to the strength of the soil’s structure. Check each horizon for redoximorphic features. When called, exit the pit and return to your workstation.
To work for a major airline, you will typically need 3,000 hours total flight time including at least 1,500 hours multi-engine, and at least 1000 hours as pilot in command (PIC) of turbine (jet) powered aircraft, preferably in scheduled airline flying and in type of aircraft. These numbers are estimates and will vary depending on the airline. Also, while these may be the minimums required to apply for a job at a major airline, they may be far from the actual competitive numbers and the actual experience of successful applicants may be considerably higher than the minimums. Airline pilots must fulfill additional requirements. Both Captains and First Officers must have an airline transport pilot’s license. Applicants for this license must be at least 23 years old and have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flying experience, including night and instrument flying, and must pass FAA written and flight examinations. Usually, they also have one or more advanced ratings depending on the requirements of their particular job. Because pilots must be able to make quick decisions and accurate judgments under pressure, many airline companies reject applicants who do not pass required psychological and aptitude tests. All licenses are valid so long as a pilot can pass the periodic physical and eye examinations and tests of flying skills required by the FAA and company regulations. Companies other than airlines usually require less flying experience. However, a commercial pilot’s license is a minimum requirement, and employers prefer applicants who have experience in the type of craft they will be flying. New employees usually start as first officers, or fly less sophisticated equipment. Depending on the type of aircraft, new airline pilots start as first officers or flight engineers. Although some airlines favor applicants who already have a flight engineer’s license, they may provide flight engineer training for those who have only the commercial license. Many pilots begin with smaller regional or commuter airlines, where they obtain experience flying passengers on scheduled flights into busy airports in all weather conditions. These jobs often lead to higher paying jobs with bigger, national or major airlines.  The Air Force, Navy (includes Marine pilots), Army, and Coast Guard offer flight training. In the case of the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard, after initial training (a little over a year) you can go back to civilian life and, once you have enough hours, qualify to fly with an airline. Remember that US companies must allow their reservists and guard members to do their active duty drills without repercussion.   Other options would be to go to a 4-year college such as the University of North Dakota or a flight academy, such as Embry-Riddle. Both offer flight training in concurrence with academic classes, but make sure to research tuition and fees. Another is the Delta Connection Academy, which is quite costly, but upon completing the course, you may be offered an entry-level interview as a pilot instructor, which may later lead to a job with Delta connection. There are no schools in the US that guarantee a position as a pilot for any company, and especially not a major airline.  To advance to the pinnacle of your profession, you'll need to gain experience in any number of creative ways. For example:   Try teaching. Many pilots start their careers as flight instructors. Take assignments with charter planes or air-taxi companies. Go private. Don't forget about opportunities flying corporate planes. And some pilots take jobs as flight engineers with the airlines.	With the proper ratings and 1500 hours of flight time, you could get hired by any number of regional airlines flying turboprop and regional-jet aircraft. Consider military flight training. Seek a variety of flying jobs.
These don't have to be in great shape, and if you don't have overalls, just wear a red shirt and blue pants/jeans.; , It is helpful if you can draw or stick on a white circle and a red capital "M" in it.  Use a ready-made mustache, or make one from fake fur/fluff. Another alternative is to draw one on if needed.  Perhaps add some padding around the tummy for a more round appearance.  These are trademark Mario.  Mario isn't going to be running around in expensive shoes!  , Everyone loves a good Mario impression.	Dress in blue overalls and a red long sleeve t-shirt. Add a red cap. Stick on a fake mustache. Imitate Mario's physique. Add white gloves. Wear comfortable brown colored shoes. Practice your Italian accent.
The color you choose will be featured prominently in your finished product, so keep that in mind when choosing your base card.   Craft stores sell blank, plain cards for this purpose.These are already folded and creased, making them easiest and fastest to use. The blank cards come in boundless varieties. If you really love making handmade cards, definitely pick up a pack of blank cards (or cardstock) next time you’re at the craft store. That way it’s on hand and ready for you at a moment’s notice! You can use any kind of paper you want, but the best choice is a durable paper that has some weight to it. The most popular choice is cardstock, which is a nice heavy paper made specifically for card making. All craft stores carry cardstock and the variety is usually vast. Your base card choice can be as simple as plain white paper! Paper that is any color of the rainbow and patterned paper are both great options as well. If applicable, consider upcycling your child's artwork for the base card, or even your own artwork! This is an even better idea if you need to make the card at the last minute and don't have a lot of craft supplies on hand at the time.; , If you’re using a full piece of paper rather than a pre-folded card, you’ll need to go ahead and fold the paper so that it will be in card form. The best looking cards have a nice, crisp crease. This is something you can do very easily with items you already have at home.   With your paper horizontal in front of you, take a ruler and measure the horizontal center of the card in two places – near the top and near the bottom. Mark the center lightly with a pencil dot in both places, and then use the ruler to connect those dots with a straight line, from the bottom to the top of the page. Use the pencil with a very light touch.  If you are crafty and already have a bone folder, this is the tool you will use to score the card. However, you can use a dull butter knife and get the same results. Scoring the card will ensure a nice, crisp fold.Line your ruler up next to the center line you’ve just drawn and take the butter knife to score the card along that line. Scoring means to push firmly into the paper so that a visible indention occurs. Be sure not to push too hard! Once scored along the drawn line, lightly erase your pencil marks.  Do this by carefully folding the paper along the scored line. Once folded, use the bone folder or some other flat tool to flatten the fold very crisply.   Using the spine of a book would be a simple solution if you don’t have a bone folder. You should now have a crisply folded piece of paper that looks almost exactly like a store bought card!  , A calligraphy pen or nice writing utensil are the best choices. However, any tool you have that will look official and special when written with will do.   Calligraphy pens work best for this, but in a pinch you could use a Sharpie or even a regular marker.  You need less than a yard of ribbon for this. Any ribbon will do, but if you are working with a particular color palette in mind, choose according to that.  These are widely available on any school supply aisle in almost every grocery store. Craft stores also carry them.   You could also use double sided tape, but a glue stick is much more preferable.  If there are any additional embellishments you want to use, pick those out now.Some fun choices are glitter, stamps, cut out paper shapes, stickers, stick-on rhinestones, additional ribbon and fake flowers. Get creative!  , Children love this card making project and since you're trying to complete the card in 10 minutes or less, a helping hand can be very useful. Ask your child to gather some embellishments and collaborate with you!  , Once you know, lightly pencil the words onto the card so that you can trace the lines with your pen.   You can write on the inside only, or on the inside and outside front cover, it’s entirely up to you. Relax so that your hands won’t shake while lettering the card. Imagine you are writing a simple note to yourself (except make sure it’s legible!) if you feel yourself starting to get nervous.  Do this slowly and carefully, taking care not to smear the ink.   If you’re lettering on both the front and inside of the card, you’ll want to letter the front first and allow it to dry completely before moving on to the inside lettering.  You’ll want to make sure the ink has dried completely before moving on. Blow lightly on the ink to help it along. Most inks take 60 seconds or less to dry.  Experiment with horizontal and vertical placements, as well as using multiple pieces of ribbon. Be as creative as you like!   Make sure your final ribbon placement won't conceal any of your writing before gluing it down. Cut your ribbon (if necessary) to fit the dimensions of your card before gluing it down.  Once you decide on the position and placement of your ribbon, you’re ready to affix it permanently. Lightly spread glue on the underside of the ribbon and press it down into place firmly.  This should only take about 60 seconds or so. You can check by lightly nudging an element, such as the ribbon, to see if it moves at all. Be careful doing this, however!  , This is optional, but if you do have other elements ready that you want to add, such as cut out paper shapes, stickers or fake flowers, this is the time to add them. It's best to add them last, so that you can truly size up what your card looks like and choose the best embellishment possible!   Decide on placement and glue them down carefully. Allow these elements to dry completely, as well.  This is also optional, but it can be a nice touch. Many craft stores will sell envelopes in a variety of colors and sizes for this purpose. These are generally located right next to the cardstock items in the store.   Carefully slip the card into the envelope and seal it as you normally would. Write the recipient’s name on the front of the envelope, if desired.  Your card is now complete and ready to be given to the recipient. Handmade cards are always lovely to receive, and much more personal than a store bought card. It will be a hit!	Choose a base card.This is the card that will be the foundation of your project. Prep the paper for folding. Score the card. Fold the card. Choose a writing utensil. Choose a ribbon. Grab a glue stick. Choose additional embellishments. Get your child to assist you. Plan out what you want to write. Write over the penciled lines using your calligraphy pen. Allow the ink to dry. Decide on ribbon placement.Try out different places on the card to put your ribbon. Secure the ribbon in place. Allow the glue to dry completely. Add any additional elements you’d like. Choose an envelope. Deliver the card!
You can do this by asking yourself pre-reading questions such as, “What is the author’s main idea?” “What does my teacher want me to focus on in this chapter?” “What have I already learned or not learned about this topic?”These questions will help you focus on important and relevant content that will enhance your leaning while excluding information that is irrelevant or that you already understand.  In addition to highlighting, write questions and comments in the margins of your textbook or on a sheet of paper if the book does not belong to you. This will help you engage with the material and retain the information better, and thus prevent you from having to read the section over again.Make diagrams, flow charts, and outlines of the material when you can. Make sure to focus on and define terms that you are unfamiliar with.  Write down the main points on a sheet of paper. Use examples to clarify the main points. If you are not able to summarize key information, then you may need to go over relevant sections once more.Limit your summary to one page.  Pick a quiet space in your house, for example your room, or the library to read. Put away other sources of distraction like your phone, computer, and the Internet. Instead, read the chapter and write your notes by hand, and silence your phone or turn it off.Additionally, make sure the the space you choose is well-lit and comfortable, but not too comfortable. If you choose to study at home, let your family (or roommates) know that you will be studying quietly in your room and that you would appreciate it if they kept the noise level down.	Define a goal. Take notes in the margins. Summarize what you read in your own words. Create a study environment that is free of distractions.
You must remember that Excalibur always speaks in a more defined tone. He speaks clearly whilst retaining an annoying aura to him. Try to pronounce things with some words missing, but as if you were an English man/lady. But don't miss too many words, otherwise you might sound retarded. Try to skip letters and not words, but don't sound like a pure British. In fact, try to speak like a newscaster, but with no accent and softly so that it annoys others and doesn't simultaneously.; , You must nearly always retell your legend in the twelfth century. Excalibur always makes this clear to others that this was the year that he was created. Remember to make sure no stories of yours link! Excalibur does this by telling one, for example, 'I always begin my days with a cup of coffee with cream... Nothing beats a cup of herbal tea in the morning... That's why I always start my day with a cup of coffee with cream!!' Remember to make everything sound like you are crazy. Make slight fun of others stupidity and funny outfits. This will surely make you have his confidence and egotistic views. Remember to always act like you are higher than everyone else. Walk with confidence! Who cares what they think?! Remind them that THEY are the odd ones.  You may need to read the dictionary for this one. Excalibur has been alive for over eight hundred years. Imagine how much he has retained! Even if something doesn't interest you, like a certain subject, learn it quickly and thoroughly so that you can boast about how you were there and make up a story to go with it. Try learning a few words that will make it seem like you definitely ARE higher in intelligence than everyone else.  Excalibur wears a white top hat, a frilled undershirt, and, for the public, you should wear a shirt bigger than your size, so you can be like him with only a shirt and no pants! Or just get a white tuxedo jacket with the pants too. This will make you look more authentic. Remember to always have a white cane with you. It should be preferred to be just up to your belly button. This way, it an still be light weight and comfy!  , Excalibur only has the finest of ingredients, such as red king crab. This, although expensive, is very unique with sea salt, coriander and a dash of lemon. If it is too expensive for you, just buy salmon and slice it to thin pieces and cook them. It will look like chunks of crab and still taste good! Remember though, don't eat foods you don't like. Although Excalibur tells others not to do something as selfish, he never ate any food he said you still should. A glass of tea, preferably herbal green tea, coffee, with milk and cream, or water will suffice. Remember that only the grandest of toilets will suffice! If you don't have a three story duck toilet, then just settle for your toilet bleached to the whites and looking extravagant.	Change your speech and pronunciation. Adopt his persona. Expand your vocabulary. Dress like him. Change your diet to reflect his.
You should cut down a piece of sandpaper so that it fits comfortably in your hand. You’ll be sanding your tail light by hand, so cut a piece that's big enough to cover a lot of area but small enough for you to easily handle. Look for sandpaper with a 2000 grit., Once you have the size sandpaper you need, dip it in clean, clear water. The sandpaper won’t hold a lot of water, so you might need to dip it more than once as you work on your tail light.  Before you start sanding with the wet sandpaper, you’ll also want to get some water on the tail light, too. This prevents your tail light from getting over scratched even if the sandpaper loses some of its water., Run your sandpaper gently over the surface of the tail light for about a minute. You shouldn’t apply too much pressure to the sandpaper, since this can also deeply scratch the tail light. Run the sandpaper across the surface and let the grit of the sandpaper do the work., After you’ve sanded your tail lights, you’ll need to apply a plastic polish. Apply two dollops to your tail light. It will spread out when you begin to buff the tail light.Any plastic polish will do, but some are made specifically for auto plastic. Brands like Turtle Wax are a good choice for this.  Once you’ve applied the plastic polish, use a buffer pad to polish the tail light and buff out scratches. This will take care of scratches both caused by the sandpaper and deeper scratches that the sandpaper couldn’t get out., Once you’re done buffing the tail light, wipe down the tail light with a clean cloth. This will remove any excess polish and give your tail lights a nice shine.	Cut out your sandpaper. Dip the sandpaper in water. Wet the tail light. Sand the tail light gently. Apply a plastic polish to the tail light. Buff the tail light. Wipe down the tail light.
Keep countertops clean to protect them from stains. Stains, buildup and dullness will result on the surface of your wood countertop if it is not cleaned regularly.   Remove any spills and debris before a stain has opportunity to set in by cleaning the area quickly. Wash the wood with soap and warm water. Rub lemon juice onto stains. Add abrasion to the surface to increase the cleaning power by sprinkling a little salt on with the lemon juice. Mix 1 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide into 1 cup warm water. Pour some of the solution onto a stain. Wait a few minutes. Rub the area with a cloth. Use wood bleach or oxalic acid on the stain. Rinse the area with water to remove any residual chemicals. Sand wood countertops to restore a fresh surface. First use 120 grit sandpaper to remove the stain. Then switch to 180 grit sandpaper to smooth the surface. Do not use vinegar to clean a wood countertop unless the wood has been sealed. Vinegar can dissolve the glue that binds the wood together and can leave the wood pithy or splintered because it eats away at the wood's density.; ,   Pour a generous amount of warm mineral oil onto the countertop. Oils help prevent warping and cracking. The wood will only accept the amount of oil it needs, so do not fret about applying too much. Make sure any oil you use is food-grade. Cooking oils should not be used. They will turn rancid with time and exposure to air, giving off a foul odor. Use a rag to rub the oil into the wood. Apply oils with the grain of the wood. Allow the oil to soak into the wood 20 to 30 minutes. Wipe the surface with a cloth or paper towel to remove any excess oil.  The wax fills in any open pores and small cracks or abrasions.   Melt paraffin wax or beeswax in the microwave, and add it to mineral oil at a 1:4 ratio. Apply this mixture to the wood while the wax is still warm. Spread it over the surface with a cloth. Allow the surface to cool and dry, and rub the cloth over it again to polish the surface. Reapply wax once a month to maintain the surface.  If left standing on the countertop, water can damage the wood. Other liquids and foods can stain the wood.   Apply coats of polyurethane to the countertop surface. A sealed surface makes the countertop easy to clean but is not recommended for cutting surfaces. Select a urethane that is FDA approved to ensure the substance is safe to be in contact with your food. Apply at least 3 coats to get a good, solid coating. , Wood kills a lot of bacteria so it is naturally a good choice for countertop material. Countertops are made from hard woods that do not allow for bacteria penetration. You should, however, clean your countertop with an all purpose cleaner to remove any surface bacteria.  On occasion, hairline and a little larger cracks can occur in a wood countertop. These are quite normal and do not mean that you have a defective countertop. You should clean any cracked countertops often and apply a finish over the countertop as soon as possible to seal cracks.  Some warping is normal for a wood countertop since wood is a material that is responsive to changes in humidity. Under normal and suggested conditions, your wood countertop will not warp to the extent that it will render the countertop unusable.   Keep humidity at a fairly consistent level, avoiding drastic fluctuations, by regulating your heater, air conditioner, humidifier or dehumidifier.	Provide protection from stains. Season the wood similar to how a cast iron pan needs to be seasoned. Fill in cracks with wax. Seal the countertop to protect it from water and other liquids. Protect wood countertops from burns by placing a trivet or potholder between the countertop and hot dishes or cooking vessels.  , Clean off any harmful bacteria. Respond appropriately to cracks in wood countertops. Protect the wood from warping by controlling the humidity in the air around the countertop.
,  This can also be done counter-clockwise, for beginners who ride goofy.	Rotate 90 clockwise 4 times in a row. Roll out.
Disney’s vault system means putting certain movies on a moratorium so that they are not available for purchase or digital viewing until they are released from the vault. Generally, Disney puts movies in a seven-year vault hold and then releases them. Disney’s reasoning behind the release is that every seven years a new generation of 2 - 7 year old children comes of age and is ready to enjoy the films. Generally, two movies are released a year.Others believe that Disney’s vault system was created to create a scarcity. Because the scarcity encourages people to rush out and buy the DVDs and Blu-ray disks when they are released, since they’re not available all the time.; , Not every movie goes in and out the vault system, and you have to know which movies you should be tracking to keep track of the vault. Currently, the movies included in the vault system are the following:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi ,Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Jungle Book. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Basically, it’s all the classics., Write down the name of the movie, its theater release date and DVD release dates. Also, track digital releases such as releases to iTunes and Amazon. When you purchase the rights or redeem a Digital HD Copy through Disney Movie Anywhere (DMA) you can continue to view your purchased titles even when they return to the vault and are no longer available to purchase. Track Diamond Editions, Special Releases and Blu-ray releases. They don’t usually release DVDs, Blu-rays and digital releases at the same time. So, you have to keep track.   For instance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was last released on Diamond Edition on October 6,2009 and in a DVD set on November 24,2009. However it was not released digitally or on Blu-ray. It went into the vault April 3rd, 2011 and is expected to be re-released on Blu-ray on February 2nd 2016 and on Digital HD and Disney Movies anywhere January 19th 2016 under the Signature collection. Review disney.wikia.com to gather some Intel on the current movies in vault to get a head start on your spreadsheet.Another item to include in your chart is anticipated releases. Generally, Disney releases two movies from the vault a year. So, calculate when the movie went into vault by adding seven years. Then, include a column for anticipated releases. For instance, Peter Pan went into the vault on April 30, 2014, so it is not expected to be released until 2021.	Research the Disney vault system. Memorize the movies in the vault. Keep a spreadsheet of the vault schedule.
You will probably have to do a monologue or a cold reading at your audition.   Prepare for a cold reading. A cold reading is when you receive an excerpt of the script at our audition and are asked to read for a specific role, either with the director or another person auditioning. A monologue is a long line (almost like a paragraph) said by one character. You may have to choose a monologue from another show or you may be given a specific monologue to perform.  During the cold reading, you may be given a bit of time to prepare. If this is the case, make sure to focus on long words or words that are hard to pronounce. When you perform the cold reading, remember to project and to face out. Use expression in your voice and feel free to use gestures and to move around the stage. Even though you probably won't have the chance to memorize any of the lines, try to look up from the script frequently so that the director can see your face. The cold reading is a good chance to try out a character voice or an accent, as long as it seems to fit the character. You might, however, want to ask the director first.  If you are asked to perform a monologue, you will probably have the chance to practice it at home. If you have to choose one, choose one said by a character similar to the one you are hoping to get, but don't choose a monologue from the show you're auditioning for. Make sure you project and face out during your monologue!   Practice and practice again. Practice the monologue over and over again until it's memorized. This shows professionalism. Use color. Color code your monologue according to the character's different emotions. Including any movement. Add blocking and business (movement and gestures) to your performance.	Prepare for the big day. Take advantage of time. Prepare ahead of time.
There are 2 main types of drum kits. You should research them both before buying anything.   Acoustic kits. This is the most common type of kit in a band and you usually see this one more often. It is much louder than an electronic drum kit and will require soundproofing or some sort of isolated room to keep everyone from getting annoyed with you. An acoustic kit also takes up more room. Electronic drum kits. These are better for beginners. They are smaller, quieter and are easier to use as you don't have to worry about tuning or anything. An electronic drum kit is recommended for beginners who can barely play. You do not need to soundproof a room to use on of these as you could just turn the volume down.; , Figure out what you are willing to spend.  Decide how large (# of drums) you want your drum set to be. This should be based on the size of the room where your drum set will be and how skilled you are as a drummer. 4-piece sets (1-bass, 1-snare, 1-floor tom, and 1-rack tom) are typically the minimum; still, the most common drum set is the 5-piece set (1-bass, 1-snare, 1-floor tom, and 2-rack toms). Of course you can go larger and can even venture into having 2 bass drums; however, I would only recommend a 2 bass drum set for advanced double bass players. Do not forget that you can buy a small drum set and add onto it later.  Decide how serious or skilled you are regarding drumming. The more serious and skilled you are the higher quality drum set you should get. NOTE: Your price range and skill will affect the size of your set.  Decide the type of sound you are looking for. Different types of wood will provide a different sound. I have provided some basic information on drum wood below.  Look in local stores or online for information on specific drum set brands. The best websites for finding brands are guitarcenter.com and musiciansfriend.com. You should pick 2 or 3 brands that you are interested in. These picks should be based on quality of the brand, the prices of their drum sets, guarantees, etc. After picking your brands, visit their website and other websites to find what professionals and fellow drummers say about these brands.  Once you have decided what brands you want, go to local stores or online and look for their different drum set models. Make sure that the models within your price range offer what you want. The best websites when looking to buy an instrument are guitarcenter.com and musiciansfriend.com. They have a great variety of drum sets and will always offer the lowest price and will beat any other offered prices.  Go to a store and play the drum sets they have. Some local stores will provide the drum sets you want; however, Guitar Center stores offer the greatest variety and highest quality of try out drums. If you cannot find your set in a local store, go online and try to find sample sound clips of the set.  After looking through and playing all the drum sets, pick around 4-6 and read reviews on those sets. Read reviews from both professionals and fellow drummers.  Pick 2-3 final sets and go back to the store and play them. Re-read reviews. Decide the advantages and disadvantages of each set (price, quality, brand, included items…)  , Talk to the people there and tell them that you are interested in drumming. Don't feel pressured to buy on your first day, in fact, don't even bring money. Tell the people there that you are not looking to buy straight away, you just want to have a look. Test both the electronic kit and the acoustic kit if they let you.    An electronic kit. If you've chosen an electronic kit, look into some good brands. Some shops are very expensive, so don't feel that an £800 drum kit is always better than a £300 one. Having said that, more expensive kits are usually your best bet. You need to spend at least £100, £200 if you can. An acoustic kit. If you've chosen an acoustic kit, look into some good brands, kits and soundproofing if necessary. You can soundproof cheaply, research some of these methods too. Again, you will need to spend at least £100 but most of the time, an electronic kit is more expensive so there's no need to spend over £200 on your first kit.  Go to the store and choose your kit. Be sure to play around on it first to make sure it's the right one for you. If it isn't, repeat the last step.	Research drum kits. What is your price range?, How big do you want you drum set?, How serious/ skilled are you?, What sound are you looking for?, What brand do you want?, What drum sets offer what you want?, Have you tried the drum set out?, Narrowing your search. Narrowing your search even more. Go to your local drum store. Choose between an electronic kit and an acoustic kit. Buy the kit.
The most common way to meet the band is to wait until they come to your area, purchase a ticket, and get backstage. Go to the One Direction website and read the events to find out when are they coming to a town near you.; , On their future tours, One Direction offers a backstage package that includes a brief meeting and opportunity for photos with the band. This variety of ticket comes with regular passes for the show in any area of the hall, and the backstage portion of the evening.  If you get the chance to meet the band, make sure you have a specific thing you'd like to talk about or something you'd like signed. You might freeze up from being star-struck, so it helps to have something pre-planned.  If you can't afford the backstage pass ticket, it's common for groups of fans to wait around after the concert between the exit doors and the band's tour bus. Make sure you obey all the rules of the venue and leave if security asks you to. If the band is feeling up to it, they may sign a few autographs or take a few pictures outside the venue before they leave back to the hotel.   If you can find out where the band is staying in town, you can also wait outside their hotel and see if you can get a chance at meeting the band.	Go to a concert. Buy a Meet and Greet Package ticket. Bring merchandise you'd like signed or a question you'd like to ask. Wait by the bus.
There are two basic types of cabinet doors -- slab and flat panel -- most often chosen. You should consider the need for speed of construction, durability, ease of cleanup and maintenance.  Most slab doors are made of plywood. Use MDF (medium density fiberboard) on a painted or a covered surface for a wood grain look.  This is done by either gluing up a panel to the width and length you need or by using a solid piece that has been specially milled for you. However, you need to know that this is usually cost prohibitive.   Lay out the dimensions of the door on your choice of sheet material.       Cut the door from the sheet using either a circular saw or a table saw.       Ease the edges of the face with a router using the bit of your choice.       Put on the desired finish, install the hinges and doorknob and you are ready to hang the cabinet door.  You need to realize that this type of cabinet door requires more tools, skill and time to create. However, the finished results can be very rewarding if you are willing and ready to step up to the challenge. Panel doors consist of two stiles (side pieces) and two rails (top and bottom) along with a panel that sits between them.   Cut the stiles and the rails from 4/4 (2.54 cm) material - if you can - and mill or plane down the material to a consistent width of .75 inches (2 cm). Accuracy and consistency of width assures a good fit. The rails need to be approximately .5 inches (1.2 cm) less than the stiles. The width depends on the project and the look you want for your cabinets. Make the stiles blanks the length you need and then run the inside edge through a stile router bit mounted on a router table.       Cut the rails to the length you need. Determine this length by measuring from the outside edge of the stiles to the beginning of the round-over, or bead, you made with the router bit. Subtract this from the width of the opening, then cut the rail blanks to length. Run the inside edge through the router using the same bit you used earlier.; , The coping bit creates a secure and tight fit of the rail to the stile. Now, run the ends of the rails through the bit.  Subtract that distance from the total height and width of the door. A flat door panel will usually be made from .25-inch (.6 mm) plywood - the same wood type as the rest of the cabinet.   Cut the door panel insert slightly less than the size you need to allow for wood expansion and contraction. Ordinarily, this will be the width of a table saw blade. Begin assembly of the door by applying glue with a brush to the inside of the stile where the rail meets it and insert the rail tenon.  Insert the panel.  Clamp the pieces together, and allow the glue to dry.	Choose which door to make. Pick the correct material to fit your doors. Use solid wood for a door when you make a panel door. Build a flat (raised panel) door for a quality look. Change the bit to a coping or stick bit. Determine the dimensions of the panel by measuring from the outside edges to the beginning of the rollover (or bead). Place rubber space balls (available at most woodworking supply stores) into the groove you created with the router style bit. Apply glue to the tenon of the rails and slide the second stile into place. Sand the door, finish as desired, install the hardware and hang the new cabinet door on the cabinet frame.
This recipe calls for the following items:   One large pot One cup of cornstarch One pound of baking soda One cup of water 1/8 teaspoon of cooking oil Food coloring  , Stir thoroughly to make the mixture as uniform a consistency as possible., Keep a close eye on the mixture so it does not burn. Stir as needed until the mixture becomes "mealy" in texture., Transfer the dough to a plate and cover it with a damp, clean cloth until it cools., Once the dough becomes cool enough to work with your hands, you'll want to knead it to make it malleable., Once the dough is cool, keep it in an airtight container while it's not being used. Sandwich bags or plastic storage containers work best.	Gather your materials. Combine ingredients. Cook over medium heat. Remove from heat. Knead the dough. Store properly.
This dress will have an elastic sewn into the waistband, giving it a vintage-like cinch. The shirt needs to be baggy, not a fitted style. It also needs to be long enough to wear as a dress—at least mid-thigh length. Men's shirts are great for this!; , Turn the shirt inside out first. This will keep the outside clean. Put the shirt on, and make a mark where your waist is. You can use a pin or a dressmaker's chalk or pen. Take the shirt off when you are done., Spread the shirt on a flat surface. Use a straight edge to draw a line across it from side to side. Use the mark that you made earlier as a guide. Flip the shirt over, and draw another line on the back. This line will be the guideline for the elastic.Use a dressmaker's chalk for dark colored shirts and a dressmaker's pen for light colored shirts.  Measure around your waist. Cut a piece of ⅜-inch (9.5-millimeter) elastic according to that measurement.Use black elastic for dark-colored shirts and white elastic for light colored shirts. If you can find a matching color elastic, that's even better!  , Fold the shirt's right side seam towards the back so that it lays flat. Pin one end of the elastic over the seam, aligning the raw edges. Make sure that the elastic is level with the line that you drew. Do not pin the rest of the elastic., Clamp the foot and needle down over the shirt and elastic. Give the elastic a tug, stretching it out. Backstitch once, then sew forward using a narrow zigzag stitch. Keep the elastic pulled taut as you sew. The fabric will gather as you sew.Make sure that you are sewing the elastic over the line that you drew. Make sure that your thread color matches the shirt material.  When you reach the left side of the shirt, press the seam down against the fabric. Sew right across the seam. Keep the elastic pulled taut.  Continue sewing across the back of the shirt. When reach the right side seam again, overlap the ends of the elastic by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew back and forth across the two ends a few times.  Knot the loose threads, then trim them down. Discard any leftover elastic.  This is not really necessary, but it will give your dress a nicer look. Cut the ribbed collar off first. Next, cut the front part of the collar into a V-neck or scoop-neck. T-shirt material does not fray, but you can bind the raw edges off with bias tape or jersey fabric, if you'd like., Your dress is now ready to wear! For a cutter look, wear a wide belt over it to hide the waist seam.	Find a large T-shirt. Put the shirt on and make a mark where your waist is. Draw a line across the front and back of the shirt. Cut your elastic. Pin the end of the elastic to the shirt. Begin sewing the elastic to the shirt. Continue sewing the elastic to the shirt, flatting the left seam as you go. Overlap the elastic when you reach the end. Snip off the excess elastic. Consider modifying the collar. Turn your dress right side out.
Self-talk is the internal dialogue that all humans have inside their heads. The more negative your self-talk is, the more it will negatively affect your confidence levels.Keep a self-talk log where you write down all the negative thoughts that come to mind when you’re practicing. Rewrite your negative thoughts to be more positive. So “there’s no use in practicing, I’ll never become successful” turns into “successful people have to work hard and if I work hard, some day I’ll be successful too.”  , All performers have something they’re good at – that’s why people want to watch them. But all performers also have weak spots, and those are the muscles you really need to stretch.Take a class and work with your instructor to improve on your weaknesses. Find a fellow performer who is really good at what you’re bad at and ask them for advice. When rehearsing, don’t practice what you already do well – focus your session on the areas that need improvement and run those parts ad nauseam.  Regardless of what kind of performer you are, it’s imperative that you see the way you are presenting yourself to an audience. Look at the way you carry yourself, the way you move your body. Practice what you’ll say to introduce a new song or joke.Set up a camera during your practice session and record yourself performing. Be critical when watching it back and look for ways you can elevate your performance. Practice each performance fifty times all the way through before stepping out on stage., Art and performance are completely subjective, so placing yourself in direct competition with someone is else is reductive. Instead of focusing on who else might be performing, focus on how you can make your performance the best you’ve ever done.Think of the best performance you’ve ever had, then try to top that. Instead of thinking about what you don’t want to mess up, think of what you want to accomplish.  Getting to perform for a living or to perform at all is a luxury. Regardless of how you feel about your craft on any given day, remind yourself that you love performing. This love and passion will shine through your performance and automatically make you a more engaging performer.   Remind yourself why you love performing every time you step out on stage. If you’re having trouble tapping into gratitude, take a break from performing. You’ll be surprised at how much you miss it.	Master your self-talk. Highlight your strengths and work on your weaknesses. Practice in front of a mirror. Only compete with yourself. Be grateful.
Scorpions enter homes looking for water. Keep floors, corners, closets and crawl spaces dry and free of leaks. Refrain from allowing water to stand in puddles or containers near the exterior of your home.; , Scorpions feed on insects, so if you have an issue with roaches, ants, or other bugs in the house, you'll need to solve that problem before the scorpions will go away. Here are a few good ways to keep the insect population down in your home:   Clean up crumbs and do dishes promptly so bugs don't have a food source. Sprinkle borax or diatomaceous earth around the baseboards and under the sinks in your home; these natural substances kill insects. Consider spraying insecticides around your home to kill insects. Do research and approach this method with caution, since some insecticides are poisonous to humans and pets. Keep the population down outdoors as well, since scorpions prefer to live outside.  Scorpions like to hide in dark places, especially during the day. Get rid of structures in and around your home that could be used as a convenient hiding place by a scorpion. Take the following measures to keep scorpions from hanging around:   Store cardboard boxes on shelves instead of the floor. Don't keep clutter around your home or under the beds. Keep your closets and bedrooms neatly organized. Scorpions like to hide in shoes and piles of clothes on the floor.Outdoors, trim back bushes and foliage that scorpions can hide under. Get rid of piles of wood, rocks or yard clippings.Trim back vines and other potential hiding spots.  Scorpions can slip through an opening the size of a credit card. Sealing your home is an important method for keeping them from invading. In order to make sure your home is secure, take the following measures to seal the doors, windows and foundation:   Use caulk to fill in holes and cracks in your walls, baseboards or the foundation of your home. Make sure your windows close tightly and the screens are sealed so scorpions can't climb in. Get door seals to prevent scorpions from coming in under the doors.  The best way to get rid of scorpions as fast as possible is to hunt for them at night, when they're most active. It's not for the faint of heart, but killing them one at a time is a good way to reduce the scorpion population around your home, fast. To hunt scorpions, you need the following equipment:   A black (ultraviolet) light. They glow in the dark, so you'll be able to see them clearly by using a black light to search them out. Get a flashlight or headlamp with a black light bulb. A tool you can use to kill them. In parts of Arizona, long-handled tweezers used to break the scorpions' exoskeletons are the weapons of choice. You can also use a long knife or wear a pair of heavy boots to step on them.  Look on exterior walls, at the bases of walls and fences, under bushes and other foliage, under rocks, and other outdoor cracks and crevices close to your home. Shine your black light in all of these areas to set scorpions aglow.   Scorpions don't normally reside in grass, so you probably won't find many there. You can also look indoors in your attic, along baseboards, and in any other areas where you've seen a scorpion.  Use long-handled tweezers, a knife, or the bottom of your boot to kill the scorpions. Then put them in a trash bag, tie it up and discard it with your regular trash.  Hunt at night with a UV flashlight and Raid ant and cockroach spray. Spray each scorpion directly with the spray. This spray has the fastest activation.  If the scorpion is high up a wall or on the ceiling, spray with Raid wasp and hornet spray to reach.  Spray an area 6 feet (2 yards) wide around the exterior of the house. Spray up to a height of 1 foot (.3 yards) on the foundation wall. Apply insecticide around the windows, doors and baseboards inside the house. Spray basements, garages and closets with insecticide. Apply insecticide to any stacked materials where scorpions may hide.  These substances will kill scorpions before they are able to enter your home. Spread pesticide dust and wettable powder around electrical outlets and plumbing fixtures, and in attics. Fill in cracks with pesticide dust.  If you continue to have problems with scorpions, call a professional pest control agency.  Sticky traps designed to catch insects or mice work well for trapping scorpions, too. Set them out around sources of water and in dark corners of your house. When you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one.  Some cats like to hunt scorpions, so having one around can really help to keep the population down. Chickens, too, enjoy eating scorpions, so consider getting an outdoor chicken coop.  Ground cinnamon is a natural scorpion repellant. Sprinkle it in dark areas, windowsills and around your baseboards to keep scorpions away.	Eliminate excess moisture. Get rid of bugs in your house. Remove scorpion shelters. Seal your home. Get the right equipment. Search around your property for scorpions. Kill the scorpions you find. Use another hunting approach. Spray insecticide designed for scorpions. Apply synthetic pesticide dust and wettable powder. Call a professional. Set out sticky traps. Introduce a cat or chicken to the household. Sprinkle cinnamon around the house.
This quick, no-cook recipe is a great go-to choice when you don't want to spend much time putting your clay together. All you need are the following supplies:   2 cups cornstarch 1 cup white school glue Food coloring (gel or liquid) Bowl  , 2 cups is a good amount to start with. With this simple recipe, you can easily add more; you'll just need more glue as well.  Add small amounts of glue to the container while stirring. Keep adding glue until the mixture reaches a good consistency—it should end up being about two parts cornstarch, one part glue.          If it's too crumbly, add more glue. If it's too sticky, add more cornstarch.  Add food coloring to the bowl and knead it in with your hands. If you want the clay to have a richer hue, add more coloring until it looks the way you want it to.          If you want to make clay in several colors, separate the batch into two or more parts and color each one separately.  You can use sandcastle molds and cookie cutters, or you can let your imagination run wild. Once you're satisfied with what you've made, set it in a cool, dry place to harden. In a few hours you can paint it and then voila! Your very own air dry clay creation.	Gather your supplies. Put the cornstarch in the bowl. Add the glue slowly. Color your clay. Use the clay.
When you are singing bass your knees and hips should be neither locked nor bent. Instead, they should be loose and relaxed. Your pelvis should be positioned over your feet. This positioning will help to optimize your vocal abilities., You also want to make sure that your head is in the right position for singing. Your chin should be parallel to the floor and your ears should be directly over your shoulders. Many people have a tendency to hold their head too far forward. This can create pressure in your throat that will impact the quality of your voice.In most cases improper head positioning is a result of an overly arched back.  In order to sing bass, you need to learn how to breathe properly from your diaphragm. Try lying on your back and resting your hands on your waist with your fingers pointing towards your belly button. Then, fill up your stomach with air by taking a slow and deep breath. You should be able to feel your hands rise and fall with each deep breath.Breath in and then exhale while counting to five. Do this ten times, making sure that your hands rise and fall with each breath. Repeat the exercise twice daily.  One common problem for bass singers is over breathing. By taking too much air a singer is forced to use their tongue to cap their breath causing pressure. Instead, you should take small breaths while singing and release the breath slowly.	Keep your knees and hips relaxed. Keep your chin parallel to the floor. Practice breathing exercises. Take small breaths while singing.
For small, local commercials you can get by with iMovie or Windows Movie Maker, but serious video editors should use a professional program for full control of their movie. Adobe Premier, Avid, and Final Cut Pro have the titles, controls, and effects that free programs don't, which will help your commercial stand out. That said, these programs are large, complex editing packages, and it will be easier to get a clean, coherent commercial with free software if you are an inexperienced editor.   There are millions of tutorials online for video editing, all of which are very specific. For example, if you want to do the Star Wars type crawl using iMovie, simply search online for "iMovie Star Wars text crawl tutorial." A video or page will usually show right up. Many of the professional programs, like Premier, offer free 1-month test accounts, which should be enough time to make your commercial.  No matter how funny your joke, how great your story, or how cool the footage is, you need to make sure you are still getting your message across. When editing, there are a couple ways to make sure your message is at the center of the finished commercial:    Bookending: Start the commercial with your message ("Here at Nick's Nissan, we've got the cheapest cars in 3 counties"), and end it with the same message, ("Come on down and buy the cheapest cars, only at Nick's Nissan.")  Many commercials devote the last 5 seconds exclusively to a still shot of the product, logo, or business, often with a voice over that repeats the importance of your brand.    Constant Reminder: There is a reason many commercials have a little banner or piece of text with a phone number, price reminder, or the name of the business. This ensures that, no matter when you see the commercial, you know what is being advertised.  Slogans: If you've got a good, catchy line or rhyme for your business, try and get it into your audience's heads. This is especially important if you have multiple commercials.  Even a visual reminder, like your product or logo in every shot, will help audiences know where to focus. You can also have the actors constantly mentioning your product.  Again, simple is almost always better. If you have multiple scenes, such as two or three different people talking in different locations (such as around a car dealership) try and use your B-roll to fill in the gaps. One of the easiest, and most professional, cuts you can make is called a "J-cut." All this is is when the audio comes in before the video. For example, you could have a shot of new cars, and hear "We have many financing options available." You then cut to the salesman, sitting at their desk, "we just want to get you into the new car of your dreams, today."   Avoid any crazy effects or transitions. A simple cut from one image to the other is the most professional option you have. The editor may cut several versions of the commercial, each at a different length. It is common to produce several spots from the same shoot.  Voice-over is, hands down, the most common commercial technique. It lets you get your point straight into the audience's ears. Luckily, all voice-over requires is a quiet room and a microphone. Once the video is cut to the correct timing, record your voice over to fit in the allotted time.   Think of all the biggest slogans in modern advertising -- "15 minutes or less could save your 15% on car insurance," or "I'm lovin' it." None of the commercials have to feature these lines. Instead, the commercial tells its story or joke, then someone comes on and says the slogan.  Contact your local broadcast affiliates (ABC, NBC, FOX) about getting ad time on their network. Ad time is usually sold in flights, meaning you order 10-15 weeks of your ad at a time. Some important considerations include:   The time of day. Ads get more expensive, usually, the later in the day they run. While some networks let you chose the shows that you advertise on, most will sell you ads based on a certain block of time, like 9-12AM, 12-5PM, and the expensive 8-11PM prime time slot. What is your demographic? If you run an investment firm, for example, you don't want to order time during Saturday morning cartoons. Do your research to see what programs air during your time slot. You likely need a credit check to get ad time. The TV station will then charge you whenever the ad airs.	Import all of your footage into a video editing program. Make sure your message is the heart of the commercial. Cut together your footage with simple transitions. Record a voice-over to get across a lot of information easily. Buy some ad time on a local network.
You can also chop up a stump to remove it. To use this removal method, you will need a stump grinder. You can rent one from a home improvement store. This machine has a rotary cutter that will drill into and grind up the stump. It's a good method to use if you have a huge, stubborn stump you need to remove. Renting a stump grinder is probably the most prudent option, but if you have a lot of stumps to grind, it might be worth it to buy one.Get protective equipment, too. Goggles and a mask will protect you from sawdust and flying wood chips. If you don't enjoy handling heavy machinery, call a local landscaper and explain that you have a stump that needs to be removed. You'll be able to pay someone else to do it.  Use a chainsaw to level off the stump just a few inches from the ground. Remove any branches or roots that stick up too far off the ground so that the stump grinder will have a stable surface on which to operate.  Put on your goggles and mask, and position the stump grinder over the stump. Then, following the manufacturer’s instruction, move the grinder slowly across the stump's surface to grind it up to bits. Continue along the arial roots to grind those as well until the stump has been fully ground up.          Be careful not to get your feet in the way of the grinder. Wear heavy boots so you won't accidentally hurt yourself. Make sure children and pets are safely away from the equipment before you begin operating it.  Remove all of the wood chips and discard them (or use them as mulch, then fill in the hole with soil.          You might need to use an ax to chop out remaining roots.	Get a stump grinder. Cut the stump close to the ground. Grind up the stump. Shovel out the grindings and fill in the hole.
This step quickly narrows down your potential targets to models within your price range. More expensive vacuums have more features and feature newer batteries but there are lesser known brands that are cheaper and will work as well but they'll lack certain features so for the sake of meeting the budget you'll need to find a middle ground as you narrow down the list.; , Find out the important features of each model you're looking at. Consider the weight, charging time, run time, type of filter, warranty, type of battery and whether it can be removed or not (this affects the long-term viability of the product - vacuums with integrated batteries have less service life than those with removable batteries) and unique features that it may have.  Different models include stick versions or handheld. You have know exactly which part of the house your using this for - are you using it on your stairs, upholstery, chairs, ceiling? If you're gonna use it primarily on floors - get a stick vac so you don't stain your back bending over. If you're using it on other areas like your chairs, sofas or other though to reach spots - consider a handheld vacuum. There are hybrids available right now in the market like the Dyson DC44 or the Electrolux Ergorapido that convert from a stick to a handheld.  The type of floor whether it is carpet, hardwood, tiled, linoleum, etc. If you have thick carpet, you'll probably need an upright because cordless vacs don't have enough pulling power to pick up dirt trapped underneath it.  This plays a major part in selecting the type of vacuum attachment that comes along with a vacuum. If you're using it primarily to clean pet hair then you need something with a beater bar or brush roll, whatever you call it to pick up pet hair shed by your pets on upholstery and carpet. Supposed want something more robust that you can use as a shop vacuum - get something with an attachment that has large nozzle so you can pick up larger debris. If you're cleaning mostly dust, then get something that has brushes on its attachments to be able to better clean up statically charged dust that tends to stick on surfaces.  You can test it in there and buy it online where it usually is cheaper.  You may get a replacement if something is wrong. Take note that all appliances will have a percentage of their products that have some sort of defect - so its better to find it earlier than late.	Know your budget. Do some research. Decide where you'll use the vacuum. Know what type of flooring you'll use the vacuum on. Figure out the type of dirt that you'll clean. Go to your local dealer to test out the actual product before buying. Put it through its paces to see if there are any potential problems or manufacturing defects.
This will prevent unintentional injury.; , You could have more than one battery, depending on the size of your RV. The battery location can vary from one RV model to the next.  Wear heavy gloves when removing the cables and always remove the black cable (the negative side) first before removing the red cable (positive side).    Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) baking soda with enough water to make a paste.       Apply the paste to the connections on the battery.       Use a wire brush to scrub off the corrosive material.       Wipe the paste off with clean water and a rag.       Apply petroleum jelly to the terminals to prevent further corrosion.  If it is low, pour distilled water into the battery using a funnel. Fill up to the fill line.  Connect the positive side to the red connection first and then attach the negative side of the battery with the black connection or clamp the black connection to a metal piece to ground it. , The indicator light will come on when the charger finishes. , First, replace the positive cable and tighten it with the wrench. Then reattach and tighten the negative side. ,	Turn off your RV and make sure you set the emergency brake. Locate the RV battery. Remove the battery cables from the battery using a wrench. Clean the connections on the battery from any corrosive substance. Open the fill cap on the top of the battery to see whether the distilled water level is low. Attach the RV battery charger to the battery. Plug in the charger and turn it on.  , Allow the charger to charge the RV battery completely. Unplug the charger and remove the connections.  , Reconnect the battery. Charge the other batteries in the same way if your RV has more than one battery.  , Take extra precaution not to cross group house & chassis battery systems as you could blow a charger inverter [[Image:  Example.jpg]]
Pick heartsease when they first open. Harvest the flowers in a "haircut" style, using scissors to remove flowers from the stems of the plant.Choose a sunny day during the late morning or afternoon, as heartsease flowers will droop their heads for protection in wet weather or at night.The plant typically flowers from May to September and will continue flowering after you pick the blooms.  If you wish to add fresh heartsease petals to soups, salads, or other meals, pick the flowers right before using them. Gently remove the petals and place them in a bowl of cold water for 10-15 minutes to plump up. Use them right away as a colorful garnish., Pick heartsease flowers and remove the leaves from the stems. Bundle flowers together and hang them upside down in a warm, dry, dark area (e.g. an attic). Leave them there for two to three weeks to dry completely.To make tea, which is often brewed and consumed for heartsease’s medicinal properties (e.g. as an expectorant or diuretic), dry heartsease flowers for immediate use or storage., Deadheading your flower crop will delay the plants from setting seed and cause them to re-flower, encouraging new blooms. Using gardening sheers or strong scissors, cut away stems of flowers that have already bloomed and grown to their fullest. Cut flowers just above the leaf nodes.Harvesting flowers will achieve the same effect, but deadheading is a wise move if do not intend to harvest all of the heartsease that you grow.	Pick the flowers. Prepare fresh petals right away to eat them. Dry heartsease. Deadhead the crop.

In order to build a basic robot, you'll need several simple components. You can find most, if not all, of these components at your local electronics hobby shop, or at a number of online retailers. Some basic kits may include all of these components as well. This robot does not require any soldering:   Arduino Uno (or other microcontroller) 2 continuous rotation servos 2 wheels that fit the servos 1 caster roller 1 small solderless breadboard (look for a breadboard that has two positive and negative lines on each side) 1 distance sensor (with four-pin connector cable) 1 mini push button switch 1 10kΩ resistor 1 USB A to B cable 1 set of breakaway headers 1 6 x AA battery holder with 9V DC power jack 1 pack of jumper wires or 22-gauge hook-up wire Strong double-sided tape or hot glue; , You'll be building the robot's body using the battery pack as a base.  This should be the end that the battery pack's wire is coming out of The servos should be touching bottoms, and the rotating mechanisms of each should be facing out the sides of the battery pack. It's important that the servos are properly aligned so that the wheels go straight. The wires for the servos should be coming off the back of the battery pack.  Make sure that they are solidly attached to the battery pack. The backs of the servos should be aligned flush with the back of the battery pack.   The servos should now be taking up the back half of the battery pack.  It should hang over the front of the battery pack just a little bit, and will extend beyond each side. Make sure that it is securely fastened before proceeding. The "A" row should be closest to the servos.  If you attached the servos properly, there should be a flat space made by them touching. Stick the Arduino board onto this flat space so that the Arduino's USB and Power connectors are facing the back (away from the breadboard). The front of the Arduino should be just barely overlapping the breadboard.  Firmly press the wheels onto the rotating mechanism of the servo. This may require a significant amount of force, as the wheels are designed to fit as tightly as possible for the best traction.  If you flip the chassis over, you should see a bit of breadboard extending past the battery pack. Attach the caster to this extended piece, using risers if necessary. The caster acts as the front wheel, allowing the robot to easily turn in any direction.If you bought a kit, the caster may have come with a few risers that you can use to ensure the caster reaches the ground.  You'll be using these to connect the servos to the breadboard. Push the pins down through the header so that the pins come out in an equal distance on both sides.  Make sure that they are firmly inserted.  This will connect the servos to the breadboard. Make sure the left servo is connected to the left header, and the right servo to the right header.  Make sure you use the red rail on the back of the breadboard (closer to the rest of the chassis).  Make sure that you use the blue rail on the back of the breadboard. Do not plug them into the red rail pins.  This will allow the Arduino to control the servos and turn the wheels.  It does not get plugged into the outer power rails on the breadboard, but instead into the first row of lettered pins (J). Make sure you place it in the exact center, with an equal number of pins available on each side.  This will ground the sensor.  This will power the sensor.  This will feed information from the sensor to the microcontroller.  Orient it so that the battery pack cable is coming out to the left at the bottom.  Make absolutely sure that the battery pack is oriented correctly.  These two cables will help provide the correct voltage to the Arduino.  The black cable should be plugged into the blue rail pin at pin 30. The red cable should be plugged into the red rail pin at pin 30.  Connect it at pin 28 on the blue rail.  Do not connect the red rails, as you will likely damage the Arduino.  This will provide the power to the Arduino.  This switch will allow you to turn off the robot without having to unplug the power.  This will power the button.  Connect it to the pin directly next to the black wire that you connected a few steps ago.  This will allow the Arduino to register the push button.  This is the Arduino development environment, and allows you to program instructions that you can then upload to your Arduino microcontroller. You can download it for free from arduino.cc/en/main/software. Unzip the downloaded file by double-clicking it and move the folder inside to an easy to access location. You won't be actually installing the program. Instead, you'll just run it from the extracted folder by double-clicking arduino.exe.  Plug the battery back jack into the connector on the Arduino to give it power.  Windows will likely not recognize the device.  This will launch the Device Manager.  If you don't see this option, click "Properties" instead, select the "Driver" tab, and then click "Update Driver."  , This will allow you to select the driver that came with the Arduino IDE.  You'll find a "drivers" folder inside. , You'll be greeted with a blank project.  The code below will make your Arduino continuously move forward.      #include <Servo.h> // this adds the "Servo" library to the program   // the following creates two servo objects Servo leftMotor; Servo rightMotor;   void setup() {     leftMotor.attach(12); // if you accidentally switched up the pin numbers for your servos, you can swap the numbers here     rightMotor.attach(13); }     void loop() {     leftMotor.write(180); // with continuous rotation, 180 tells the servo to move at full speed "forward."     rightMotor.write(0); // if both of these are at 180, the robot will go in a circle because the servos are flipped. "0" tells it to move full speed "backwards." }     , Click the right arrow button in the upper-left corner to build and upload the program to the connected Arduino.   You may want to lift the robot off of the surface, as it will just continue to move forward once the program is uploaded.  Add the following code to the "void loop()" section of your code to enable the kill switch, above the "write()" functions.      if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH) // this registers when the button is pressed on pin 2 of the Arduino {     while(1)     {         leftMotor.write(90); // "90" is neutral position for the servos, which tells them to stop turning         rightMotor.write(90);     } }     , With the kill switch code added, you can upload and test the robot. It should continue to drive forward until you press the switch, at which point it will stop moving. The full code should look like this:      #include <Servo.h>   // the following creates two servo objects Servo leftMotor; Servo rightMotor;   void setup() {     leftMotor.attach(12);      rightMotor.attach(13); }     void loop() {     if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH)      {         while(1)         {             leftMotor.write(90);              rightMotor.write(90);         }     }       leftMotor.write(180);      rightMotor.write(0);  }	Gather your components. Flip the battery pack over so that the flat back is facing up. Align the two servos on the end of the battery pack. Affix the servos with your tape or glue. Affix the breadboard perpendicularly on the open space on the battery pack. Attach the Arduino microcontroller to the tops of the servos. Put the wheels on the servos. Attach the caster to the bottom of the breadboard. Break off two 3-pin headers. Insert the two headers into pins 1-3 and 6-8 on row E of the breadboard. Connect the servo cables to the headers, with the black cable on the left side (pins 1 and 6). Connect red jumper wires from pins C2 and C7 to red (positive) rail pins. Connect black jumper wires from pins B1 and B6 to blue (ground) rail pins. Connect white jumper wires from pins 12 and 13 on the Arduino to A3 and A8. Attach the sensor to the front of the breadboard. Connect a black jumper wire from pin I14 to the first available blue rail pin on the left of the sensor. Connect a red jumper wire from pin I17 to the first available red rail pin to the right of the sensor. Connect white jumper wires from pin I15 to pin 9 on the Arduino, and from I16 to pin 8. Flip the robot on its side so that you can see the batteries in the pack. Connect a red wire to the second spring from the left on the bottom. Connect a black wire to the last spring on the bottom-right. Connect the red and black wires to the far-right red and blue pins on back of the breadboard. Connect a black wire from the GND pin on the Arduino to the back blue rail. Connect a black wire from the back blue rail to the front blue rail at pin 29 for each. Connect a red wire from the front red rail at pin 30 to the 5V pin on the Arduino. Insert the push button switch in the gap between rows on pins 24-26. Connect a red wire from H24 to the red rail in the next available pin to the right of the sensor. Use the resistor to connect H26 to the blue rail. Connect a white wire from G26 to pin 2 on the Arduino. Download and extract the Arduino IDE. Connect the battery pack to the Arduino. Plug the Arduino into your computer via USB. Press .⊞ Win+R and type devmgmt.msc. Right-click on the "Unknown device" in the "Other devices" section and select "Update Driver Software.", Select "Browse my computer for driver software.", Click "Browse" then navigate to the folder that you extracted earlier. Select the "drivers" folder and click "OK." Confirm that you want to proceed if you're warned about unknown software.  , Start the Arduino IDE by double-clicking the arduino.exe file in the IDE folder. Paste the following code to make your robot go straight. Build and upload the program. Add the kill switch functionality. Upload and test your code.
Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix.  Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working. , The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again.  You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn.  Read your owner's manual to find the location of your car's fuse box. Your owner's manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn.; , You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken.  You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again.    A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself.    If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.	Determine the problem with your horn. Pop the hood and have someone press the horn if it is sounding at low volume. Locate the horn or horns on the radiator core support or behind the car's grille.  , Remove the wire connector. Purchase a replacement horn if cleaning the horn parts does not fix your reduced sounding car horn. Check the fuse box if your horn will not make any sound. Remove the fuse with a pair of tweezers, needle-nosed pliers, or a pair of regular pliers. Replace the fuse if it is faulty. Check to see if the airbag light is illuminated on the dashboard if there is no problem with your fuse. Take your vehicle to a professional mechanic if the airbag light is illuminated.
Look through your local newspaper or community bulletin board for gardening groups or clubs. They may hold meetings or seminars where you’ll learn valuable garden knowledge. Clubs also usually tend a community garden where you can get hands on experience with various plants.  If you can’t find an official club, ask around your friends and family to see if anyone works a garden that you could come and check out.  Search the business directory for plant farms near you. Give them a call and ask if you could spend a few hours a week working with them. Just watching how they tend the plants will teach you a lot. Work the plants if they will let you., If you are interested in starting a new job path, or you have some free time to pick up part-time work, look for nursery jobs. Your job would consist of growing plants and transplanting them to their new homes.  This type of work requires you to be outside and do a lot of bending and heavy lifting. Make sure you are physically fit enough for this type of work.  One of the best ways to learn is by doing. So find a garden spot in your yard, till up the soil, and plant some seeds. You may not succeed with all of the plants at first, but you’ll learn a lot along the way. Find a few food plants or flowers that you are interested in, and buy seeds to start up your garden.	Join a community garden club. Volunteer at a commercial plant farm. Apply for jobs at local nurseries or landscaping companies. Start your own garden.
The seeds are the shining jet part tucked within the strawberry coloured flesh. The entire flesh and seed are held together in brown cases. See the image to understand better.; ,, It is a good idea to keep the seedling pots in a sheltered and warm place.  It will grow quickly once planted in the garden and is hardy.	Collect seeds from the tree after flowering. Plant the seeds into seedling pots, about halfway down into the seed raising mix.  , Water regular. Plant in the garden once it has taken form and appears strong.
To do this exercise, start on the lowest note you can easily play and play four quarter notes and two half notes, or short-short-short-short-long-long. Do this twice on each note until you have gone as high as you can.	If you are a beginner, a good warm-up exercise is called Mississippi Hot Dog.
Do not plant an Ohia tree over 9,000 ft (2,743 m) in elevation. Ohia trees are not suited for high elevations, and will likely wilt and die if planted too high.Higher elevations likely have too little oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain an Ohia tree, and may not have enough humidity.  If you live in an area above 9,000 feet (2,743 m), consider finding a different species of tree to plant.; , Ohia trees need near-constant sunlight during daylight hours, and so should be planted in an open space that affords plenty of light.Do not plant your Ohia tree near a large wall or building that will block the sun. Similarly, do not plant the Ohia near a larger tree or bush whose foliage will prevent sun from reaching the Ohia.  Young Ohia trees and bushes that have not fully grown may prefer partial sun (about 6 hours of sun exposure a day), until they reach maturity. If your Ohia is in the ground, you won’t be able to change its sun exposure as it matures. However, if the Ohia tree is in a planter, you can move the planter to keep the juvenile tree in partial sunlight.  Ohia trees will become unhealthy if the soil they are planted in becomes saturated and waterlogged. To avoid this problem, plant your Ohia in a soil with good drainage. The soil should also be rich in organic material, which will nourish the growing Ohia tree and keep it healthy.You can purchase a planting soil mixture at your local hardware store, or at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Ask the sales staff for assistance, and request that they help you find a soil that drains well.  Unlike various other tree species, Ohia trees can be grown from seeds relatively easily.If you live in Hawaii, you should be able to purchase Ohia seeds or a small seedling at a local plant nursery or gardening center. If you live elsewhere, you can order Ohia seeds online. Check with plant retailers that specialize in Hawaiian flora, including Maui Native Nursery and Kauai Seascape nursery.  The seeds of the Ohia tree are tiny, and a cluster of them may look like a small pile of dust. These seeds grow in ¼-inch (0.65 cm) pods on the Ohia tree. The seed pods burst open when they have matured, and allow the seeds to disperse.  Fill any size planter with a planting soil mixture, and lightly sprinkle the tiny Ohia seeds on top of the soil. Ohia seeds will grow best if exposed to plenty of sunlight, so place the planter outdoors, away from shade. Water the seeds lightly at first, with a spray bottle, until they start to sprout.Even if you’re unable to place the Ohia seeds in full sunlight, they’ll likely still grow. The seeds are tough and can grow in practically any light conditions. The seeds will grow best between 50°F and 93°F (10–34°C). If the outdoor temperatures dip below 50 or climb above 93, bring the plant indoors to more stable temperatures.  If you can obtain a cutting from an Ohia tree in your area (perhaps from a tree owned by a friend or family member), you can use this to grow your own Ohia. Plant the Ohia cutting in soil that is porous and drains well, so the cutting isn’t drowned by repeated waterings.If the cutting is too small to stand erect in a pot full of soil on its own, you can stick a large dowel in the soil and tie the cutting to the dowel using thread.  Take your cutting from the stem or branch tips of a mature Ohia tree. The cutting that you plant should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) in length, and ¼-inch (0.65 cm) in diameter. A cutting will take time to begin establishing its own roots: at least a week or two.  Once the young Ohia tree (whether grown from seeds, a cutting, or a seedling) has begun to grow, you’ll need to transplant it from a pot directly into the ground. Plant the Ohia in organic soil. Ohia roots need to be able to absorb water but should never become waterlogged, so plant the tree in soil that drains well and is not prone to forming puddles.Ohia trees grow quickly, and will become root-bound if left in a pot for too long. Put the plant in soil in the ground as soon as it grows large enough to encourage healthy growth, or about 1 foot (0.3 meters) tall.  The Ohia roots will have sufficient room to expand in a hole of this size. Make the hole roughly the same depth as the root ball, so that the trunk of the seedling will not be buried once it’s planted.While you’re digging, turn the soil by breaking apart clumps, removing rocks, and flipping the shovelfuls of soil upside down so that the organic material can be worked through the soil. For added soil drainage, place a couple of cinder blocks at the bottom of the hole to allow for soil drainage. You should be able to purchase cinder blocks at a local hardware or landscaping store.  Once the cinder blocks are firmly in place, gently set the Ohia tree in the hole and cover the roots with a rich soil mixture. Be sure not to cover the base of the trunk with soil., Ohia trees thrive in tropical environments, and consequently need to be watered often. Plan to water your Ohia tree at least once a week, using water from a household hose. In order to keep the tree healthy and encourage its growth, you can also apply a fertilizer. Purchase an 8-8-8 or 13-13-13 fertilizer, and apply it to the base of the Ohia tree once every six months.Hours after watering, make sure that the soil is draining well. You should not see any puddles around the base of the Ohia tree, and the soil should be damp but not saturated.  Since Ohia trees frequently produce large, pleasant-smelling flowers, bees and other pollinating insects frequent the trees. Ohia trees are almost constantly in bloom, and so constantly attract insects.If you’re bothered by the bees or wasps, you can set up a bee trap or occasionally spray bees with an insecticide like Raid.  Also, avoid planting an Ohia tree within 10 feet (3 meters) of a door or garage. If large numbers of bees or wasps are frequently in the tree, they may fly into your house.  If you’re planning on growing more than a single Ohia tree, you don’t need to worry about giving the trees plenty of space in every direction, as with some other species. Ohia trees can grow well while crowded together. Plant multiple Ohia trees with as little as about 5 feet (1.5 meters) between their trunks.Over the years, as the Ohia trees grow, you may decide to prune some of the trees’ branches. Prune using a pair of pruning shears, in cases where branches from two Ohia trees overlap.	Avoid locations with high altitudes. Choose an area that gets full sunlight. Make sure that your soil has good drainage. Purchase Ohia seeds or a seedling. Plant your Ohia seeds. Plant an Ohia cutting. Re-plant an Ohia cutting or seedling into rich soil. Dig a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball. Place the seedling in the hole and cover it with soil. Water and fertilize the Ohia tree. Remove unwanted insects from the tree. Plant multiple Ohia trees near one another.
; , In an emergency you, a loved one, or even a neighbour could be cut, burned or injured in some other way. If you have these basic supplies you are better prepared to help people when they are hurt.  Contact your local emergency manager and ask. If your location does not have an emergency manager, check with your county or state emergency management official for assistance. , In the event of a disaster, power will be out and batteries will be unavailable, sold out. The latest models have the "Weatherband/Emergency Band" and will also charge your cell phone, thus if your cell phone fails in a disaster, it will be that the cell phone towers, their infrastructure will be damaged, even destroyed. it also doesn't hurt to have a satellite phone which can be used with out a cell tower it connects to orbiting satellites.  Depending on where you live, you might need different things in an emergency such as flood, hurricane, tornado. Of course there are a few things that you should have regardless of location.  These are especially helpful if you must evacuate and emergency routes may involve detours. , If you can't pick up everything at once you should add an item or two to each shopping trip.  Your first aid kit should contain:   A minimum of two pairs of Latex gloves for the smallest kit. Remember, it may be a stranger who needs your help and having a latex barrier will help prevent infection.  Use vinyl gloves if you or a family member is allergic to Latex. Latex allergies can be severe. Keep more pairs in your disaster kit that will evacuate with you. You may go through several pairs in one emergency. Check the integrity of the gloves if they've been stored in changing temperatures. They may become brittle. Sometimes gloves deeper in a box may still be good so don't toss the box because the first few pairs are bad. Look through them all.   Sterile dressings to stop bleeding. (Look for bulky dressings called surgical pads in health supply stores) Cleansing agent/soap and antibiotic towelettes to disinfect.  Antibiotic ointment to prevent infection.   Burn ointment to relieve pain. Adhesive bandages in a variety of sizes Gauze pads Micropore tape Tweezers Scissors Eye wash solution to flush the eyes or sterile saline as general decontaminate. Sterile saline is available in litter bottles in health supply stores. Thermometer Prescription medications you take every day such as insulin, heart medicine and asthma inhalers.  You should periodically rotate medicines to account for expiration dates and have a plan for refrigerated insulin.   Over the counter pain medicine (Like Tylenol and Advil) and an antihistamine (Like Benadryl). Prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood pressure monitoring equipment and supplies. , This does not have to be expensive. Just a large waterproof box with a lid. These are available in the storage sections of most discount stores.   It should be small enough so that in an emergency, you can roll it into your car, yard, or home in just a few minutes. Look for something with wheels and/or handles. Consider placing kits in your home, car, and workplace. You never know where you'll be when an emergency strikes. Use backpacks or plastic tool boxes for jump and run bags. Keep everything sorted with clear zip sandwich, quart or gallon bags. For worker/s in large urban areas keep a backpack under your desk which contains water, energy bars, flashlight, spare socks and good walking shoes in case public transportation is disrupted.  Water is the most essential life sustaining resource. Keeping water (in clean plastic bottles) in your home, car trunk, and workplace will keep you hydrated when you're under stress.   You may need more water for children, nursing mothers, the elderly or if you live in a warm climate. You may need to add electrolyte replacement drinks (Gatorade or Powerade) to replace valuable minerals in warm or humid weather or if you will be very active. ,, Buy ready-to- go meal kits that can feed multiples.	Look at the Things You'll Need to see what your kit should contain. Make a first aid kit if you don't already have one. Determine what hazards exist in your local area. Write a plan based on the hazards, then build a kit to support the plan.  , Purchase "Self Powered Flashlights" and "Self Powered Radios". Pack according to location. Pack a map in your kit. Gather together the items on the list that you already have at home.  , Keep a running list. Designate a first aid kit for emergency or disaster and one for everyday use. Go to the store to buy the items you don't already have.  , Obtain a waterproof box. Stay hydrated!, Keep at least a three-day supply of the items listed in the "Things You'll Need" section (below) in the box.  , Consider other things you might need--especially things such as medication, bandages, firearms, or other things according to age, location, or health.  , Don't forget to pack nonperishable food into your kit.
For most guitarists, the easiest way to do this is with a guitar tuner. These devices are available at most music stores. Set your tuner according to the string you are tuning, play that string, and the tuner will indicate whether you are sharp or flat. Adjust the tuning peg by twisting it to raise flat notes and lower sharp notes until your tuner indicates the note is in tune.   You can also use a tuning fork, a pitch pipe, or some other instrument that is already in tune to tune your guitar. Play the instrument of each string and tune the strings one at a time until they are perfectly in tune with the note played by the tuning fork, pitch pipe, or tuned instrument.; , In reggae, the strumming generally is on the offbeat. The offbeat is on the "and" that occurs in between the beats of a 4:4 time signature song. So if you're counting the beats "1... 2... 3... 4," imagine an "and" in between each main beat. This is the offbeat.   A simple reggae strum pattern uses a down-strum on the "and" like "1 (and) 2 (and) 3 (and) 4 (and) 1..." Your first strum should be a down-strum.There are some exceptions to the "play on the offbeat" rule. Music is largely about conveying a sense of feeling or getting into a groove. The strumming of the strings is referred to by many different names in reggae. Some call it a "chop," "skank," or "bang.", This is the second most common strum pattern in reggae music. Once you down-strum on the offbeat, draw your hand back across the strings upwards in an up-strum.   Once you are more experienced with reggae, you may be able to alternate between playing down-strums and down-up strums, but while learning it may be easiest to stick with one at a time. Another common strum pattern is to single strum on the first offbeat and then do a down-up strum on the second offbeat., Use firm pressure with your left hand on the fretboard to lessen the sound produced in the strings while strumming. This will create a quality of sound that's called "chicken scratch" in funk music.By muting the strings and focusing on the strum pattern, it's likely you'll pick up the groove of reggae music more quickly.  Pick one of your favorite reggae songs and listen to it to get a feel for the rhythm. Then play the song a second time, only this time strum in time with the chords that are played in the recording. Don't worry if you don't know the chords that are being played. This exercise is just to help you get a feel for the rhythm.Again, you may find it easiest to strum along with the song you have chosen by muting the strings with firm pressure in your left hand across the fretboard. This way, you won't be distracted by the sound and can focus on matching the rhythm.  Now that you've gotten the hang of the basic strum patters reggae, you can start working on getting the right sound out of your strings. This requires the right amount of pressure on the strings on the fretboard with your left hand. To get a feel for the effect your left hand pressure has on the sound of your guitar, play chords in reggae rhythm and adjust the pressure in your left hand as you play.Try playing chords with while using extremely light pressure, moderate pressure, heavy pressure with your left hand on the strings. Your left hand affects the sound of the strum of your chords not just by pressure on the strings but also duration. While using different levels of pressure, experiment with pressure duration. For example, you might use moderate pressure at the onset followed by the release of your left hand.  Staccato is a musical term that means notes are played in a clipped, detached fashion from other notes. This quality can be produced by applying quick pressure to the strings with your left hand followed immediately by a sudden release., In reggae, the stuck line is the guitar part that follows along with the bass guitar. This part is generally muted to give a mellow tone to the acoustic accompaniment of the bass.Use moderate pressure with your left hand on your fretboard when playing the stuck line.  Finger pick the notes of the stuck line to create a distinct sound in the notes.  Try to do this especially with bar chords that extend across the entire fret, like A major. Bar chords are where your finger covers the entire fret. Keep your playing arm loose and swing it down to strum your hand over all strings, from the first to the last.Many times, beginning guitarists will approach the strings on an angle with their right hand. This kind of technique can lead to missed strings in the strum. You can play reggae with a three or four string strum, but using all five is recommended. This will give you a fuller sound in your playing. The rhythm of the music is more important than hitting all the strings. As the rhythm becomes easier, you can shift your focus to hitting all the strings., If you play your guitar stiffly, you'll probably notice the sound of your guitar reflect this, causing your guitar to sound too mechanical and stiff for reggae. Try to get into the groove of the music by swaying gently or bobbing along with the rhythm.Your guitar should bounce slightly with your left hand as you push the sound out by drawing your right hand across the strings.  You can use both major and minor chords as you practice. You should choose chords and chord progressions that fit with the song you are trying to play. For example, you might try a 3-chord progression of the main chords of the song you are practicing.At first, look through the music and pick chords that come easy to you and sound the best together. Then try linking these with more difficult chords. Take your time connecting the chords together slowly and fluidly. This is a good opportunity for you to practice and learn the song inside and out. Once you are more comfortable, choose more complex chords and variations to put your own flavor on the sound.  Some well known reggae musicians you might want to listen to include Bob Marley and the Wailers, Prince Buster, and Jackie Mittoo. Note how these performers play their songs and try to emulate it.   You can look up the chords or the tabs for many of the songs played by professional musicians online. This way you don't have to guess at which chord is being played.	Tune your guitar. Play the chords of your reggae song on the off beats. Use a down-up stroke on the offbeat. Mute the strings and practice strumming. Strum along with a song. Adjust the pressure while strumming. Make your notes staccato. Mute the stuck line when playing in an ensemble. Strum in a harmonic, percussive fashion. Groove with the rhythm of the music. Alternate your chords. Imitate the reggae masters.
Most bottles will be covered by a label and you may want to remove that label so that your message in a bottle is not mistaken for trash.To remove the label, place the bottle in hot water and let it sit for at least one hour. The hot water will loosen the glue on the label and make it easy for you to peel the label off. You may need to scrape some of the glue off of the bottle.; , Fill the inside of the bottle with warm soapy water and cover the opening of the bottle with your hand. Gently shake the bottle up and down for at least 30 seconds to remove any substances from the inside of the bottle. Pour out the soapy water and rinse the inside of the bottle with warm water., Once you have removed the label and cleaned the inside, place the bottle upside down in a strainer and allow it to dry. It will take about one hour for the inside of the bottle to completely dry, depending on the temperature in the room. You can also allow the inside of the bottle to dry overnight.   To dry the inside of the bottle more quickly, place it in the oven on low heat at 150 °F (65.6 °C) for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Be cautious when removing the bottle from the oven and allow it to cool off before continuing with the process. Another alternative for drying the inside of the bottle is rolling up a paper towel lengthwise and placing it inside of the bottle. Be sure to leave a portion of the paper towel on the outside of the bottle so that it can be easily removed.  Start writing your message while the bottle is drying. You can write a story about your life, a poem, or an encouraging message. The possibilities are endless and you should write whatever you want to share, as long as the message is positive.   Since it is highly likely that a stranger will read the message, be sure not to reveal sensitive personal information. For instance, do not include your age or phone number if you are under the age of eighteen. You can add things that you enjoy, such as your favorite sport or your favorite food. Once you have finished writing your message, read it to determine if it is truly what you want to share with a stranger. They may contact you years down the road, so be sure to share something interesting. Some people send a message in a bottle for sentimental purposes, such as sharing a love story., Instead of using your address, use a Post Office Box number. You can also use an email address if you have an email address that you feel comfortable sharing with strangers. This allows the recipient to track you down and tell you where they found your message in a bottle.  Roll up your message as tightly as possible and place a small piece of tape around it to keep it from unraveling. Be sure that the tape will not destroy the message when the recipient unrolls the message. Drop your message into the bottle after the bottle is dry and make sure the entire piece of paper fits in the bottle.  Use a permanent marker to write a warning on the outside of the bottle, such as: "Do not throw this bottle away - message inside!" Make sure that the words are clearly visible.  You can improvise with an insoluble material and waterproof glue. The goal is to prevent water from seeping into the bottle and destroying the message.   Pour melted wax onto the cork before placing it back onto the bottle for a much stronger seal that is more likely to endure water and temperature changes. , To make sure that your bottle is buoyant and floats, drop your bottle into a bathtub and make sure that it does not sink to the bottom. No one will receive your bottle if it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.   If it does not float, you will need to find another bottle.  The goal is to simply place your bottle in the ocean and hope that it reaches a far away destination.   Check the litter rules. Verify that the rules in your county do not prohibit you from sending a message in a bottle., Now that you have sent your bottle off into the world, all you have to do is wait. Do not expect to hear from someone that day, the following week, or the following month. It could take many months, even many years for someone to receive your message.   Be patient and do not get discouraged if you do not receive a response because it could still happen years down the road. It has been reported that bottles from the titanic survived at sea for over a century.	Remove the label (optional). Clean the bottle. Dry the bottle. Write a message. Add contact information. Secure the message. Add a warning. Re-cork the bottle with the original top. Test your bottle. Take it to the ocean. Await a response.
The 52 white keys on a piano keyboard are called according to the name of each key's associated note. Notes range from A to G ascendingly, so letters increase moving to the right on the keyboard (as in A → B → C) and decease moving to the left (as in C → B → A). Furthermore:Once you reach the end or beginning of the note sequence, it repeats. So when moving to the right up the keyboard, G → A → B, whereas moving to the left yields A → G → F. The 36 black keys on the keyboard represent a half-step difference in tone between white key notes. A sharp (♯) is a half-step up, and a flat (♭) a half-step down.  Most black key notes have two different possible names. For example, the black note between F and G could either be called both F# or G♭.Easily locate the C note on your keyboard by finding the white key immediately to the left of a group of two black keys. The C key closest to the middle of your keyboard should be middle C, which is a central note for most beginner level songs.; , In many songs, you'll find small numbers above or below notes. These numbers indicate the recommended finger you should use to play the note. Very basic songs many have finger notation for each note, while more complex songs may have little finger notation. Each number represents a single finger:   1: represents your thumb 2: represents your index (pointer) finger 3: represents your middle finger 4: represents your ring finger 5: represents your pinky, When first beginning, you may find it a little difficult to play a finger when you read its number. This is common, but by learning finger notation thoroughly, so it is automatic, you'll find playing easier.   Many beginning students find scale drills an effective way of learning proper finger positioning. A scale is an uninterrupted run of notes, usually in 8 note increments, that moves up or down through a musical key. As many basic piano songs have a lot of finger notation to assist beginners, you may want to make use of these resources to practice., Keep your fingers slightly curved but firm so that when you press a key your finger does not bend backwards at all. Your thumb and pinky fingers especially will want to lie flat, but keep these raised as well.Try to keep your arms and shoulders relaxed as you play. This will enable you to use more of your entire body while playing and will help you achieve a better sound from the keyboard. As you press a key, you should feel the weight from your arm transferring down into the key through your fingers. Although you might think that the position of your fingers doesn't affect your playing much, proper form will allow more freedom and nuance in your playing., In music, the staff refers to a set of five horizontal lines on which notes are written. Piano generally has two staffs, one for the treble clef and the other for the bass clef. The top staff normally indicates right hand notes, and the bottom staff left hand notes.   You can find the treble clef by looking to the far left of the staff. It will look similar to an "&" symbol. This clef is usually the upper of the two clefs. Find the bass clef on the left side of the staff. It will look like a backwards "C" followed by a colon ( : ). It is usually the lower of the two clefs. Notes that are especially high or low on the staff in either clef are represented by additional lines added to the staff, called ledger lines. In some cases, like when playing songs with only very high notes, you have two treble clefs or, for low songs, two bass clefs.In these cases, the bottom clef will represent your left hand., Each line and space on the staff represents a single note on the keyboard. However, the way you read these lines and spaces will depend on whether you're in the treble or bass clef.   Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the treble clef:Lines: Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.Spaces: F A C E  Each bold letter in the following indicates the ascending order of notes for lines and spaces in the bass clef:Lines: Good Boys Do Fine Always.Spaces: All Cars Eat Gas., There are 12 major and 12 minor keys in music. The key of your song will be indicated by either sharp (♯) or flat (♭) symbols following the treble and bass clef in the staff, or it may have no symbol. These indicate that certain notes (or no notes) are always naturally played as either sharp or flat notes (black keys) in a song or certain part of a song.   When there are no sharps or flats, the key is C and all natural notes are played on white keys. The relative minor of C major is A. Generally, with each sharp/flat added to the key signature, a previously white key note becomes a black key note.  Major keys: G (one sharp), D (two sharps), A (three), E (four), B (five), F# (six), C# (seven), C♭ (seven flats), G♭ (six flats), D♭ (five), A♭ (four), E♭ (three), B♭ (two), F♭ (one).  Minor keys: E (one sharp), B (two sharps), F# (three), C# (four), G# (five), D# (six), E♭ (six flats), B♭ (five flats), F (four), C (three), G (two), D (one)., You may have noticed that certain notes have special shapes. These tell you how many beats you need to hold that note in a measure. A measure is indicated by a vertical line through the staff. The space between vertical staff lines (or a vertical line and the staff beginning or end) equals a single measure.The following basic note rhythms express the main beats in a measure with numbers, same-beat broken rhythms with X's, and separates beats with plus signs (+).   Sixteenth note: is held for a quarter of a beat (as in 1-x-x-x+2-x-x-x+3-x-x-x+4-x-x-x | 1-x-x-x...) Eighth note (♪): is held for half a beat (as in 1-x+2-x+3-x+4-x | 1-x+2-x...) Quarter note (♩): is held for one beat (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2...) Half note: is held for two beats (as in 1-2+3-4 | 1-2 + 3-4...) Whole note: is held for four beats (as in 1-2-3-4 | 1-2-3-4...), The time signature will be represented by a fraction following the clef of each staff. For most beginning level songs, this number will likely be 4/4. The top number indicates how many beats are in each measure, and the bottom number represents which note equals a full beat.   As the top number lets you know beats per measure, each measure in 4/4 time gets four beats (as in 1+2+3+4 | 1+2+3+4...). In 3/4 time, you'll have three beats per measure (as in 1+2+3 | 1+2+3...), and so on. Add a one on top of the bottom number of the time signature to find which note equals a single beat. Normally, this will be 1/4, meaning that a quarter note stands for a whole beat. However:  In cut time (2/2 time), this number is 1/2, so a half note equals a single beat, a whole note two beats, a quarter note half a beat, and so on. In this way, note rhythms can sometimes change., A rest is a pause in music. Much like musical notes, rests also have rhythm markings to help you determine how long or short to hold the rest. Rest rhythms follow the same pattern as notes, so the basic rests also include:   Sixteenth rests: pause for a quarter of a beat Eighth rests: pause for a half of a beat Quarter rests: pause for a beat Half rests: pause for two beats Whole rests: pause for four beats, An "accidental" is another name for sharp (♯), flat (♭), and natural (♮) symbols. When an accidental is written, all notes on that line/space for that measure are also changed, unless the sharp or flat is removed with a natural mark (♮). After a measure, all sharped, flatted, or natural notes return to normal.   Natural marks can also remove the natural sharps or flats of the key you are in. For example, in the key of D major, the notes F and C are always sharped, even without an accidental.Applying a natural to these notes would remove the sharp for a measure.  If you are a true beginner, a beginning level practice book, lesson book series, or primer can provide you with simple songs that help you practice piano basics. These books often include liberal finger notation, which will help you master proper finger position.   You can find basic piano materials at your local music store, book store, or through an online retailer. If you have some music experience, you may want to visit a music store to ask a knowledgeable representative about what book to start with. With enough time and dedication, even beginners can learn moderate to difficult songs. However, be mindful that difficult songs could be too difficult for your level and lead you to getting discouraged., When first learning a song, accidentals (like sharps (♯), flats (♭), and naturals (♮)) can take you by surprise. Highlight these so you don't miss them. Furthermore, you may want to:   Circle or highlight fingering that looks difficult or is unusual. In particular, beginners often struggle with interval jumps (like from C to F). Write in the note names for notes written on ledger lines above or below the staff, as these can also be difficult to read., First, divide the music into manageable sections. This will be different for each person, though you might want to consider tackling your song one measure at a time or in five measure segments. Then:   Play through the right hand. Play slowly, with a steady rhythm, until you have completed the section you are working on. Practice this until you can play the notes smoothly to a steady beat. Repeat your single handed play through with your left hand. Consider using a metronome, set to a slow tempo, to help you keep a steady beat. This can help you get a better feel for rhythm.As your playing improves, increase the speed at which you play. As you increase your speed, you should start to hear the melody of the song come together., After your one handed play through, you may have noticed certain parts of the song give you more difficulty than others. For example, there may be a large interval (like an 8-note jump) or a run of fast notes (like 10 eighth notes in a row), and so on. Isolate and practice these until you can play smoothly and without hesitation.   Switch between hands when practicing so you don't tire out one hand more than the other. If you notice you consistently have trouble with certain parts of music, like with large interval jumps or runs, you may want to drill these. Drills can be found in most practice books or online., Much as you did when starting one hand at a time, start putting your left and right hands together slowly. Make it a goal to play left and right hand notes that fall on the beat together.   As your hands become more familiar with the song and play it more fluidly, increase the speed until you are playing the song at a normal pace. More complex rhythms, like combinations of eighth and sixteenth notes, might take more time to come together. Some basic music books may teach treble and bass clefs one at a time to encourage mastering each hand before putting hands together., Learning new songs will challenge your ability to read music, which will help improve your sight reading ability. Beyond that, the more often you play the more familiar the keyboard will be beneath your fingers, which will lead to better playing.Many songs, especially older ones, have become public domain. This means the song is free for everyone. Search for free public domain sheet music for songs online.  Your piano bench should be positioned so that when sitting on the front half of it your elbows are a little in front of your body. Your arms should be level with or slightly sloping down toward the keys. Your feet should be flat on the floor.For most benches, you'll find that you can adjust the height by turning a knob mechanism or pressing a spring release under or behind the bench., Sit tall and with a slight inward lean to the piano when playing. This might seem unimportant, but your posture at the keyboard can greatly affect the sound you produce. A straight spine will allow you greater stability and poise. It also will enable you to more easily involve your upper body weight when playing, which will help you create a more dynamic sound.Beyond the technical complications created by poor keyboard posture, slouching can also negatively impact your presence when playing., It can be difficult to notice poor posture in yourself. If you are teaching yourself piano, you might want to ask a friend or family member to check your posture from time to time. Make sure you let them know what to look for when it comes to proper piano posture.   If you have a consistent posture problem, you might want to set up a full length mirror to the side of your bench. This way, periodically while playing, you can look over and check your own posture.	Learn the keys on the keyboard. Make sense of finger numbers. Practice finger notation so it is automatic. Position your fingers and hands with proper technique. Identify the staff, bass clef, and treble clef. Read the notes for each clef. Understand the key signature. Recognize the basics of rhythm. Coordinate rhythm with the time signature. Recognize rests. Gain a firm grasp on accidentals. Acquire appropriate music. Look through the music and highlight important features. Play new music one hand at a time. Identify and isolate difficult runs and intervals. Put both hands together. Learn new songs and practice regularly. Adjust the piano bench to suit your height. Sit up straight when playing. Check your posture regularly.
What you choose to make your carrier from should depend on personal tastes and what you have available. Obviously a very old t-shirt might be a bit too stretched out to be safe, but one that has been worn a few times should still be perfectly fine. /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg          Cotton tees are a good choice because they are soft against the baby's skin and they tend to be more breathable. Be aware of your baby's skin, especially if it is very sensitive. Try to avoid using the hems of the t-shirts if possible. If you buy new tees be sure to wash them first, especially if they are dark or brightly colored as the dye can transfer.; , The yarn that you use should be strong enough to securely hold the loops together, plus support the weight of the baby. A yarn that will not stretch or pill is important for added security. /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg          You have the option of using other materials such as twine here, but do cover it with something to prevent scratching or irritating the baby's skin. You can use an extra scrap of the discarded t-shirt parts to make a cover by simply snipping off a piece, folding it in half so that the raw edges are not showing and then tying it around the yarn or twine. This also can be done for pure aesthetic purposes as well.  All that you will need for this project are: three t-shirts, one piece of yarn and a pair of scissors. The t-shirts should be pre-washed if they are new and should be in your regular size or perhaps, one size up. /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg          Do not think that you need to make the carrier too big, because the material will relax slightly and this will make the carrier too large for safety.  This will give you three fabric tubes. Save the top portions for other projects if you are so inclined. /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg         , If you are standing over top of your workspace you should be looking at two oval (or circular) shapes very close together. /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg          This is the step where the yarn will come in - gather the yarn around both tubes, going up and through the middle so that when they are tied the two form what will look like a figure eight. Tie the yarn several times so that it is very secure and then cut off the excess.  With your scissors cut from the top, left hand corner and then diagonally to the bottom right hand corner, but only through the top part of the tube. What you will end up with is a wide piece with two narrow flaps in front. /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg          This may sound confusing at first, but it is really quite simple. With the tube laid flat you have a top and a bottom part. The bottom part will be the part which is laying on the surface you are working from. Only cut the top part diagonally across, cutting from top to bottom.  Let them fall to your waist. The tied section should form an X and this part will be on your back to help distribute weight and make the carrier more stable and more comfortable. /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg         , /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg          This is one of the reasons that using different colored t-shirts is suggested - this way, you know that you have the blue loop (for instance) on your left shoulder and the red one on the right shoulder.  Take the baby and slide him down your chest and then place one leg into each loop. Make sure that both legs are not in the same loop. Once his legs are in the proper place you should spread out the material to give him support and to prevent painful bunching. /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg         , While the carrier is a great way to carry your baby, you'll need to be sure that you have positioned him correctly. Until he is six months old or so, you will want the baby to face inward rather than outward to prevent problems with the hip. Follow these positioning tips: /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg          The baby should appear to be “seated” with his knees coming just above his bottom and comfortably bent. You can tell if the baby is in the proper position on your chest if you can bend and kiss his head without strain. The baby’s knees should be wide apart instead of forced inward. A good carrier keeps the hips and knees spread and supports the thighs., Take the third t-shirt piece and wrap the widest part (the back side of the tube) around the baby’s bottom and lower back area. Wrap the two flaps around your own waist and tie them securely to help support the baby. /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg          This will also provide some additional support for your own lower back and should make the carrier much more comfortable to wear. Again, spread out the material to prevent bunching. Now you are ready to go with your easy, no-sew baby wrap carrier.	Choose the right t-shirts. Pick out your yarn. Gather your supplies. Cut all three t-shirts armpit to armpit, directly across. Take two of the tubes and tie them together in one spot, end to end. Lay the third fabric tube out flat. Take the tied loops and put them both over your head. Take one loop and place it over your arm and up to your shoulder and then repeat with the other loop to the other side. Place your baby in the carrier. Position your baby correctly. Use the third t-shirt piece to secure your baby’s bottom.
There are two basic subsystems on passenger cars, the deceleration system, a hydraulically functioning, operator controlled dynamic braking system, and a parking brake system, which is activated by a mechanical linkage and prevents to car from moving while it is parked. Here are specific problems you may observe on each:    Parking brakes  Failure to engage. If the parking brakes fail to engage, the car may roll when left unattended.  Check the distance the control handle or pedal travels. If the control travels its limit and the brake doesn't engage, you either have a broken cable or linkage, or the brake drum/disk assembly is not working correctly. Determine if the brake stays engaged when you apply it. If not, the mechanism which holds it engage, either a cam or gear type locking mechanism is broken or out of adjustment.   Failure to disengage. Make sure the brake disengages when you release it. If the parking brakes fail to disengage the powertrain will be working against the parking brake system when you drive causing it to work harder, wearing and overheating the brake components.  Sticking drum/rotor components can cause the parking brake to fail to disengage. Cables or linkages can cause the system to fail to disengage.      Deceleration braking components.  The master cylinder provides hydraulic fluid pressure to cause the slave cylinders to engage the friction component (either shoes or pads, depending on the car's configuration) to engage the drums or rotors which slow the rotation of the wheel. The master cylinder is mounted to the firewall underneath the car's hood on the driver's side. Check the following to determine if you have a problem with the master cylinder:  Check the fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir. Some cars have a translucent reservoir that allows you to see the fluid through the side, others require you to unscrew or remove the clamps and take the lid off the reservoir. There should be a fill line and add line marked clearing on the side of the reservoir. Check the area around the master cylinder for leaking brake fluid. This can indicate a damaged reservoir or the seals inside the master cylinder itself leaking and allowing the fluid to escape.    Slave cylinders cause the brake shoes or pads to engage the drums or rotors. They are located on each axle, either on the rotor assembly or inside the brake drum, depending on which system your car utilizes.  Check each hub for leaks. You can usually do this by looking at the back of each wheel to see if there is evidence of fluid dripping or accumulating on the inside surface of the wheel assembly.    ; , You will want to find an empty parking lot or quiet side street to do this.   Check the brake pedal travel by starting your engine and applying pressure to the pedal while the car is in the park or neutral position.  Begin by pressing gently and seeing how far the pedal moves before encountering resistance. Normal travel varies from one car to another, but generally, should not be more than 1/4 of the distance from its highest position and the floor of the car. Press harder on the brake pedal and hold a steady, firm pressure to see if the pedal fades, or gradually begins to move downward while you hold it. Pump the pedal rapidly a few times to see if it returns to the same position under pressure each time. If the pedal stops at a higher position when the brakes are pumped, you may have air trapped in your brake lines.   Release the parking brake and put the car in Drive or first gear and engage the transmission by releasing the clutch. Listen for scraping or squeaking sounds from the car's axles while the brakes are not in use. There are a number of moving parts in action when the car is rolling including the rotors, bearings, and gears, so some sound is normal, but hard scraping sounds or squeaking may indicate a brake problem. Press down lightly on the brake pedal and listen to see if any sounds you hear increase or disappear. A steady rubbing sound indicates uniform contact of the brake components, where an irregular scraping or rubbing sounds indicates a warped brake rotor or drum.  Be particularly alert for vibrations or a change in resistance felt in the brake pedal. This is a warning there may be air in the brake's hydraulic system.   Accelerate your car to as safe a speed as possible in your location, up to about 20 mph (32 km/h), and apply the brakes stiffly. Observe if the car's wheel seems to pull in either direction. An ineffective brake will cause the car to pull to the opposite side, whereas, a sticking brake will cause the car to pull sharply to the side the brake is sticking on.  Park your car on a firm, level surface, preferably on a paved driveway or garage floor. Chock the wheels, and raise one wheel with a floor jack if available. Install jack stands if you are going to work on wheels while they are elevated. (For spoke type wheels, brake rotors may be visible while the wheel is on the ground.)   Look at the surface of the car's brake rotors (if equipped with disc brakes). They should be smooth and shiny, with a uniform silver color. Purple or bluish discoloration indicated they have been overheated, roughness, swirling groove, or splotchy and grainy surface appearance indicates abnormal wear or rotor warpage. If the wheel is lifted off the ground, try to rock it to see if there is any unusual movement in the wheel bearings assembly. Rotate the wheel so you can listen for sounds of uneven brake contact. Now have an assistant engage the brake and check to see if the wheel becomes immobile.  It should be somewhere between the full and low mark. Never "top off" your brake fluid if it's not below the "too low" mark. As the brake pads naturally wear down, the piston pushing them against the rotor will adjust, drawing more fluid. Installing new pads resets the piston to its original position. "Topping off" the brake fluid when pads are worn may cause overflow and other issues once new brake pads are installed.  If you hear a squealing or grinding noise when you apply the brakes, it may be a sign that you need to replace your brake pads. Excessive brake dust on your wheels is an additional sign of brake pad wear. Grabby brakes or brakes that seem to vibrate can indicate that your pads are worn out, too. It's often wise to turn the rotors or replace them when you replace your car's brake pads.  A faulty brake power boost unit causes the brake pedal to depress more than usual in order to activate the brakes.  If your brake pedal is hard to press down, it's likely that your vacuum system needs repairing.  Contaminants in your brake fluid may cause your brakes to function incorrectly. If your brake pedal pushes down further than normal to activate the brakes, it may be a sign of contaminated fluid.  A hard to press brake pedal is an indicator of a blocked brake line.  If your brake pedal seems to have no pressure and your car doesn't brake well, you might need a new master cylinder.  Bad discs result in grabby brakes or a vibration when braking. One disc may be the problem, or all of them may need to be replaced.	Learn the types of braking systems used in modern automobiles. Isolate braking problems by test-driving the car. See if the car decelerates normally. Inspect the visible components of your car's brake system. Check your brake fluid. Replace your car's brake pads. Ask a mechanic to test your brake power boost unit. Check your car's vacuum system for leaks. Bleed the brake fluid from your car and replace it with fresh fluid. Examine your brake lines and replace any damaged or broken lines. Install a new master cylinder. Inspect your car's brake discs.
Fairs and conventions can be a great way to connect with new people and sell your artwork, but they can also be expensive. There’s the cost of your booth itself, along with travel expenses and time off of your day job (if you have one). Try to sell first at events close to your home, until you have a good grasp on what you need to do to succeed at a convention.  Many conventions start booking their booths nearly a year in advance; you’ll want to stay on top of deadlines for your chosen events, and apply as early as possible. Most conventions have a set application, including a portfolio and an artist’s statement--this will help the organizers determine if you’re a good fit in genre and style.However, it’s just as important to know if the convention is a good fit for you. Before you apply, find out the answers to some of these important questions.   How much space is each booth allowed? Is a chair included? Will there be an outlet nearby? Is the space accessible (especially if you have any mobility considerations)?  , When you go to a fair or convention, you’re not just there to hang out: you’re there to promote your artwork and your brand. Be kind to everyone, from guests to fellow artists to staff, don’t let your art spill over onto other people’s tables, and clean up after yourself.   Pack the artwork you bring carefully, and make sure to have extra packing supplies. Bring business cards, too--this way, even if someone isn’t able to buy a painting today, they can refer back to you later..Pay for your booth or table at the convention on time; otherwise, your spot may go to someone else., Your paintings are what will hold most people’s attention, but you’ll need to catch their interest first. Decorate your booth in a way that matches your aesthetic and corresponds to your paintings to draw the eyes of potential customers.   Consider setting out small objects that correspond to your subjects (for instance, shells, if you like painting seascapes.) Bring a nice solid-colored tablecloth to make an even, professional-looking workspace.A standing banner with your name, an art sample, and contact information on it can go almost anywhere, and commands attention without being too obnoxious., Now that you’re all set up, be friendly with the people who come by your table. Smile and say hi to browsers, and try to master the art of engaging in conversation without being too pushy. You can even consider doing quick commissions, like sketches or watercolors, for interested buyers.If you don't know what to say when someone is looking at your work, a smile and a simple "Hi there!" or "Hello!" works wonders. It's easy to engage with buyers with sincere compliments ("I love your shoes!"), as well.	Start local. Apply early and with care. Be professional. Bring decorations to go with your paintings. Be engaging.
The classic sailor suit is white with royal blue stripes. The idea is to take the color palate of the classic sailor suit and complement it with other hues like red and light brown.Adding not so nautical colors will help to mix up your outfits and keep your look from being a costume. You don’t want to look like you’re dressing for Halloween! Instead, think of nautical as a style you can customize to fit your wardrobe.; , Start with basic pieces that you can then pair with other bottoms or tops.Look for a striped shirt with vertical stripes, rather than horizontal stripes. Horizontal stripes can make your torso look wider, rather than long and slim. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your stripes. Make a statement with large or thick stripes on a shirt or a skirt. Go for lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton, jersey, and denim. You can wear nautical year round, though it may be more suited to warmer seasons like spring and summer., Jeans are a great way to integrate nautical style into your wardrobe, especially a dark navy skinny jean or a relaxed boyfriend jean.   You can also go for a pair of cropped navy pants or a pair of high waisted jean shorts to add some variety to your nautical look., If you’re dress your nautical style down for a casual day out, go for a striped shirt, jeans, and comfortable flats or sandals in light brown. You could also slip on a pair of tennis shoes or your favorite white Converses.For a more dressy night out, choose a dress with stripe details or a small anchor print. Or go for a pair of cotton pants and a striped blouse. Add white heels or wedges to the outfit to complete the dressy nautical look. Another great way to add some nautical to your look is to wear a navy or white blazer with a striped shirt, jeans, and flats. For a night out, pair the blazer with a navy or striped dress and a pair of simple wedge heels.  Keep only one element, like a shirt or skirt, nautical. Then, keep the other outfit elements simple so they complement the nautical piece.This could be as easy and effortless as pairing a striped blazer with a plain t shirt and jeans or with a collared white shirt and a pair of navy pants. You can also add different textures to your outfit, like a white cashmere sweater instead of a blazer, or a ribbed sweater on top of a white collared shirt.  Choose a striped purse with rope details or gold jewellery with anchors or sail boats, but don’t pile one too many accessories at once. The key is to highlight one main accessory and then keep any other accessories simple and minimal.   Look for a striped purse with brown leather details or rope details.Go for a bold statement necklace in gold with blue or white details. Look for a bracelet with anchors or little lobster charms. Or layer on two or three thin gold necklaces for a more subtle look. Add a thin gold belt to a navy or striped dress to give your outfit a fun, chic element. Make your outfit nautical with a cotton scarf in navy or in an anchor print.	Go for a blue, white, red, and light brown color palate. Choose several key wardrobe pieces, like a striped shirt and a cotton skirt. Go for jeans or cotton pants. Dress nautical down or up with a few tweaks. Highlight one nautical element in your outfit. Accessorize, but don’t go overboard.
Expect peridot to come in various shades of green. Visit a respectable jeweler to browse a number of samples, all at once. Familiarize yourself with the different shades that it comes in, from olive to rich green to slightly yellowed.The iron content in each gem determines its color. The deeper the green, the more iron is present.; , Although peridot comes in a variety of shades, make sure the shade of each gem is consistent throughout its body. Inspect all sides of loose stones to see if they match each other in color. With jewelry, check all exposed sides.If possible, view it under different sources and levels of light, as well. Expect the gem’s color to remain consistent regardless of changes in lighting.  This is a matter of taste, of course, so go with your gut. However, bear a few things in mind. Expect many people to consider green gems free of any other tints to be the finest specimens.At the same time, be aware that imitations are usually free of these tints as well.Imitations include apatite, green garnets, green sinhalite, green tourmaline, green zircon, and moldavites. If authenticity is an issue, go with a gem with a yellowish tint, since this never occurs in imitations.	Look at a variety of stones. Check for consistency. Decide on a shade.
There are many services, both online and in person, that you can make use of to establish the approximate value of your car. These estimates will vary, as the true determining factor of your vehicle’s worth will be dependent on time, condition, and the buyer. For example, a buyer may be willing to pay well over the listed price of a vehicle due to the fact that your classic reminds him of his first car.   Set the price of your vehicle slightly above its projected worth. This way, you can allow yourself to be bargained down without taking a loss. Local collectors often have forums that you can find with a general online search. These are great places to see how similar or same model cars are selling in your region. You might also take your car to a professional assessor. You may have to pay a fee for this, or you could always have your car assessed under the guise of using a consignment service, only to change your mind once you know the ballpark value of your classic car.; , In some cases, this might be an auto auction. In other cases, you might find an online posting would best for your classic car. Venue will largely depend on the kind of classic car you are trying to sell. If you are unwilling to put in the time and effort into finding the best venue, you can always sell your car to a dealer or have it consigned.Selling to a dealer or having your car consigned, which is where someone else sells your car for a fee, will earn you less money from the sale but diminish hassle considerably.Auto auctions will also have associated fees for providing a venue, sometimes costing a buyer or seller a percentage of the amount paid. Do your homework on the auction house you are considering before agreeing to auction your car there. Posting your car along with its description and general information on a classic car automotive listing service is generally the most cost effective route for selling your vehicle. These often only require a fee per each posting. Posting your car for several months, however, could end up costing you a pretty penny., This can be anything from uncommon color combinations to fully-loaded features, or even a souped-up engine under the hood of a classic muscle car. When making a claim that a feature is rare, you should have some kind of proof to back this claim up. Usually, this comes in the form of production numbers, which you can request from the car manufacturer.   History can also play a part in raising the value of your car. For example, if your car was once owned by a famous person, or used in a movie, your car might be worth more than its original estimate. Do some research so that you know instances where your classic took the spotlight. You could raise your car's esteem in the eyes of buyers if you mention it was featured in a classic TV show, movie, or automotive exhibition., While your classic car might be desirable to collectors in the region you live, it will be less exotic in your region, as it was likely produced and distributed there. In a foreign market, however, where your car will likely be even rarer. However, your classic car will need to be a worthy value to justify the expense of transporting a car internationally.   You might also want to look into the fuel and emission standards for the country you are considering advertising your car in. Even avid collectors might pass on your vehicle if their country's laws disallow them from driving the vehicle. For example, if your fixer-upper classic is only worth an estimated $20,000, many buyers might not consider it worthwhile to pay international shipping fees, which can range as high as $5,000., While you never know when an interested buyer will make a bid on your classic car, generally speaking, the summer months bode best for selling. Winter months can be especially slow, as many people will have budgeted money for holiday expenses, leaving less free cash available to buy a classy set of wheels.   While selling your car in the off-months of fall and winter is possible, you may have to adjust your price lower than you had planned. Economic factors, like fuel shortages or increased gas prices, can also influence the sale of your car. You can improve your changes by selling while car related expenses, like gas, are low., Now that you’ve decided on a venue or agent, like you would have with an auto consignment, you should have your car listed with photos, a description, and a list of special features that might interest prospective buyers. Be as honest as possible in your listing to promote honesty throughout your transaction.   Although honesty is important, you shouldn’t feel like you have to explain every ding or age-related flaw on the vehicle. Classic cars are expected to have some age and use related deterioration. You may have to pay some fees to have your vehicle listed on a site that sells classic cars. As these differ greatly according to site, you should investigate your particular venue for listing and budget for the cost. Vehicle auctions are popular places to sell your classic car. Each auction house will have its own fee system. In some cases, this might be a buyer's commission, in other cases this may be a seller's commission, where you'll have to pay a percentage of the money made on your car sale., Many buyers will want to see your classic car with their own eyes, and may even bring along an automotive expert or automotive savvy friend to help assess your vehicle. Have information on hand about the car’s history, and answer any questions your buyer has as honestly as possible.   When someone calls about the car, arrange a time when he can come evaluate the car in person. Even the best photos of your vehicle will not be a perfect substitute for seeing the real thing in person. If you are uncomfortable meeting a prospective buyer alone, you should invite a friend to keep you company at the time of the inspection. You could also call a friend and let him know when you will be showing the car. This way he can be on the lookout for your text or call should any problems arise. It's always a good idea to get information up front from prospective buyers. A major question you should ask before meeting: "Will you be viewing the car alone, or should I expect a guest to come with you?"  , Some buyers will want to test drive your classic car to see how it handles and listen to the engine. Be sure you verify the buyer’s insurance and driver’s license before even considering allowing a potential buyer to drive your classic. An accident while on a test drive could leave you with a bunch of scrap instead of a tidy sum gained from selling your classic car.Under no circumstances should you allow a potential buyer to test drive your car alone. Even with collateral, like a credit card, it's unlikely that if the car is stolen the collateral will make up for the loss of your classic car. You may want to consider choosing the test drive route for your car. Depending on the kind of classic car you have, you might want a good straightaway where the test driver can accelerate to evaluate the engine. Scenic test drives, like those you might see on car advertisement commercials, can make your car more appealing to buyers. Winding roads, lakeside or seaside routes, and picturesque boulevards can help your buyer visualize himself driving (and owning) your classic car.  Once a buyer has checked out your car and decided he is interested, the negotiation process begins. There are many negotiation tactics you can use while deciding on the final price of your classic, you should have a firm idea of the upper and lower limits of the range you are willing to accept.Think of a sales pitch for your vehicle before meeting with interested parties. You can tailor your pitch to those interested by asking, "What interests you most about this classic car?" Then you can highlight features related to this interest. A personal endorsement from you will likely carry weight as well. Mentioning the car's history of reliability, its performance, or even its appeal to other collectors can garner even more interest among buyers. You should expect to be bargained down at least somewhat from your asking price. This gives the buyer the illusion of a better deal. Begin with your asking price slightly above what your car is valued at. Don't price your car too much more than the estimated value. This might scare off potential buyers, or it could lead buyers to thinking that you are over-inflating the price for a purpose - like for the purpose of being bargained down.  Now that everything agreed upon, you’ll have to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the new owner and fill out associated paperwork to make the sale official. Depending on your region or country, the requirements for transferring ownership may vary slightly, but generally you’ll need to:   Complete the bill of sale. Sign over the title Fill out the Release of Liability Submit necessary forms to your state DMV Provide copies of maintenance records.You should black out any personal information that is included in the records/history of the car that you provide the new owner.  Some classic cars are valuable purely due to rarity, but more often than not, a defining characteristic in addition to rarity makes a classic desirable to collectors. You’ll have to do some research into your classic car to find out just why collectors might want to buy your car. Then you should restore these original features as best as you can. Some characteristics that might set your classic car apart include:   An elegant, unique body A large, powerful engine A plush, comfortable interior Luxury features, like wooden paneling, Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth, like a microfiber cloth, and specially formulated car-washing soap to do this. Park out of the sun so that your car does not dry too quickly before you and wet, lather and rinse your car. Then:   Wet your car with water. If your home has issues with hard water, you may want to use distilled water to wet, wash, and rinse your car. Add your soap to water in a bucket. Agitate the water to spread the soap throughout it. Lather up your cloth and soap up the car thoroughly. Be sure to get the wheels, undercarriage, and all nooks and crannies as best you can. Rinse the car and make sure to get all soap washed off. Then you should hand dry your car with a microfiber cloth or chamois., Appearances matter when you’re selling your classic car. Potential buyers are likely going to try to bargain you down in price using any reasoning they can, and in your case, this might be a poorly maintained exterior. A coat of wax can go a long way toward making your old classic look like it just came off the assembly line. Buy your wax from your local automotive store and then you should:   Wax your car on a cool day out of the sun. Hot days cause the wax to dry immediately, making buffing the wax and getting the best shine difficult. You should aim for days between 55° and 85° F (13°C and 30°C).Follow the instructions that came with your wax. In most cases, this involves using a foam applicator to apply the wax in small amounts to the body of your car. Always use less wax; you can add more if you need to. Apply the wax in circular motions evenly. Buff the body of your car, if you desire. Allow the wax to rest as directed by the wax directions. Polish your car with a microfiber cloth., You’ll want the interior of your car to be as clean as humanly possible to get the best price. Vacuum dust and crumbs, wipe down the dashboard, spray out your air vents with compressed air, and make the interior look as though it were new.   Many classic cars have leather upholstery. To make these look fresh and bright, you may want to look into how to clean leather car seats. Many automotive stores sell specialty automotive wipes that work well at cutting grease and buildup that accumulates on the dashboard and console of cars. These might help your detailing work go faster. For classic cars that need serious TLC, or if you feel unconfident in your ability to safely and correctly detail your classic car, you may want to pay a professional to detail your car for you., If your car is in prime condition and full working order, this can significantly raise the value of your classic car. The best way to prove this to prospective buyers is by having your car inspected by a professional. A full, comprehensive inspection should take around an hour, and will generally cost somewhere between $75 and $100.   Though this might seem like an unnecessary expense, proof that your car is in near mint condition could add thousands of dollars’ worth of value to the vehicle., Be all inclusive in your classic car’s photography. Leave nothing out. Even if you are hesitant to capture some of the rougher areas of your car on camera, many buyers expect some amount of wear and tear on classic cars. Honestly showing the true condition of your car will encourage honesty with potential buyers.   Include well-lit pictures under the hood, showing the condition of the engine. If you have access to a car lift, put the car up in the air and take detailed undercarriage photos. Although you should be comprehensive with your car photos, try not to be repetitive.	Estimate the value of your classic car. Determine the best venue for selling your vehicle. Highlight and provide proof for rare characteristics. Investigate international markets. Time the listing of your car for best results. List your car. Meet in person with prospective buyers. Exercise caution with test drives. Negotiate with potential buyers. Make the sale. Identify and target the key features of your car. Wash the car's exterior. Wax your car to make it look shiny and new. Detail the interior of your classic car. Get a pre-sale inspection. Take detailed photos of the car in good light.
Mums’ root systems cannot handle too much moisture. Mums planted in containers will require more water than those planted in the ground, as mums in the ground can absorb natural water like rain and dew.Don't allow mums to wilt between waterings. If the lower leaves wilt or turn brown you need to water them more. Avoid splashing water onto the foliage as this could promote the growth of bacteria or cause your mum to become diseased.  Mums are short-day plants, which means they need a long period of darkness to flower.  You should use a balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Feed them especially during the vegetative growth period to prevent premature flowering.At each watering use a 20-10-20 or equivalent solution. When the blooming season begins, switch to a 10-20-20 fertilizer or equivalent.  Treat pythium root and stem rot, fusarium wilt, bacterial leaf spot, botrytis blight, and chrysanthemum white rust with natural fungicides like garlic oil, neem oil or sulfur.  Abolish common mum insects like aphids, mites, thrips, and leaf miners with insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils., This ensures you will have domes of brightly-colored blossoms come autumn.Pick off dead or fading flowers to encourage more blooms.	Water mums sufficiently but don't allow them to stand in water. Keep mums away from street lights or artificial light during the nighttime hours. Fertilize mums frequently. Treat fungus with fungicides. Keep the plant area clean and clear of plant debris to prevent pests and diseases. Pinch the tips of young mum plants in late spring and early summer to make them bushy and compact.
There has to be a good reason why he went bad (we'll just assume the murderer's a boy, but generally the same rules apply to females.) Watch the reruns/read through the book and find key points which indicate their reasons for turning to 'the dark side of the force' (yes, Anakin Skywalker, we're talking about you). Try to see the whole thing from their perspective, not yours!; , The more you see it, the easier it is to accept: they're the bad guy, and there's nothing you can do about it.  This particular character has had his ups and downs in life. Observe times when he didn't realize that he was bad.  This helps in any case. If they repent at the last moment, it makes everything a little better. NOTE: this step is optional.  There's good and there's bad, this character just did what he believed was right. Everybody has their own personal beliefs. It's easiest just to accept it.  Oh, the irony! It will be simply smashing to see how the other characters react to this sudden betrayal. Savour this part, trust me, this is always an exciting part of a story.  The other characters, unless they are extremely emotional, will accept their betrayal and get on with their lives. After all, none of us can linger on the past. Follow their example. It may take a while to get it through your mind that he did wrong, but take your time and don't pressure yourself. After all, these characters aren't perfect.	Understand his reasons. Reread/watch the part where their true nature is revealed. Reread/watch happier times. Cry a bit. Understand moral. Enjoy the aftermath. Move on.
These are listed below. In particular, you will need to match three buttons in descending size to make each button flower. Choose buttons according to their interest and colors. You may wish to color theme them, or make a more eclectic arrangement.; , Assemble three buttons on top of each other. They should be in descending order, with the largest at the base and the smallest on top.  Pull the loop firmly into place to draw together the three buttons and wrap the wire neatly in place underneath the large button, around the wire length. Use pliers to help you wind it, if needed.  Cut at the end to form the stem. The button flower will be sitting pretty at one end, the other end ready to be inserted into the arrangement.  Vary the stem lengths to make the result reflect a real bunch of flowers in a container.  Cut down the florist's foam to size and insert into the container. Cover the foam with dried moss or other floral cover to prettify it.  Simply insert the wire stem end into the florist's foam in different places. Rearrange until you're happy with the final look.   If you don't want to use florist's wire, find a pretty bottle and simply slip the wire stems into it.	Assemble the supplies needed. Make the flowers first. Loop the wire up through one side set of aligned holes, then bring it down the other side (only two sets of holes is needed). Measure enough of the wire length that you wrapped the wire around to create a stem. Repeat for more flowers on stems. Create the container for the flowers. Arrange the button flowers in the container.
A sturdy, cardboard tube will form the structure of your rain stick. You will want to avoid flimsy tubes—the cardboard must be durable enough to withstand several punctures from nails or toothpicks. You may use a recycled cardboard tube or purchase a new cardboard tube for this project.   You may use a recycled paper towel roll, chip canister, or gift wrap tube.You may buy a cardboard shipping tube from the post office, an office supply store, or a shipping center.; , While some tubes, such as shipping or chip canisters, may come with end caps, other cardboard rolls will not. To make your own end caps, you will need construction paper, a pencil, and a pair of scissors.   Place one end of the tube flat on a piece of construction paper. With a pencil, trace the end of the tube onto the paper. Draw a second circle around the first circle. The two circles should be approximately ½ inch apart. Draw 6 to 12 spokes between the two circles. You will use the spokes to attach the cap to the cardboard tube. Cut along the edge of the second circle. Cut along each spoke line. Repeat., The soothing sounds of a rain stick are created by a filler, such as rice, falling through a maze of static objects, like nails. You can fill your rain stick with one or more materials.Common fillers include:   Rice Dried beans Corn Kernels Small pastas Beads, Nails are ideal for thicker cardboard tubes, like shipping or chip canisters. Select nails that are shorter than the tube’s diameter. With an adult’s help, hammer the nails through the side of the tube at random intervals—you can hold the nails while an adult taps them into place or visa versa. To secure the nails in place, wrap the tube in a layer of duct tape.   You may insert as many nails as you would like. For decoration, use a patterned or colored duct tape. Using different sized nails will create an interesting sound!, Toothpicks are a great option for narrower cardboard tubes, like a paper towel roll—the tube’s diameter should be less than the length of a toothpick. You will need an adult’s help to complete this step.   If you want to decorate the tube, do so before you insert the toothpicks. Use a sewing needle or push pin to poke holes at random intervals into the side of the tube. You will need to create between 80 and 100 holes. Insert a toothpick through one hole and out another. The tips of the toothpick should remain on the outside of the tube. Repeat 39 to 49 times, altering the angle of each toothpick. Coat both ends of each toothpick with a dab of glue. Once the glue is dry, cut off the pointed ends with a pair of cutting pliers., Aluminum foil is the ideal material for young children to use. You will need two pieces of aluminum foil. Each piece should be 6 inches wide and approximately ¾ the length of the tube. Roll each piece into a long, snake-like strip and then coil it into a spring.   After you cap one end of the tube, you will insert the aluminum foil springs., If you made your own end caps, set one end of the tube in the center of the paper cap. Fold each of the spokes up towards the tube and adhere it with glue. Allow the glue to dry.If your tube came with caps, insert one into the tube. You may reinforce the cap with duct tape or rubber bands., Carefully pour the filler into the tube. If the tube’s opening is narrow, you may want to use a funnel.   If you chose to use aluminum foil, insert it into the tube before you pour in the filler.  Cover the open end with your hand or put in the remaining cap. Tip the rain stick over and listen. If you are happy with the sound, proceed to the next step. If you aren’t quite satisfied, adjust the amount of filler you have in the tube by:   Adding more filler Removing some of the filler Trying a different material, Place the cap on top of the tube’s opening. Fold down each spoke onto the outside of the tube and glue. Once the glue is dry, enjoy your new instrument!When the glue is dry, it will no longer feel tacky to the touch. See the packaging for specific curing instructions. You may reinforce both caps with duct tape or rubber bands.	Pick out a cardboard tube. Create caps for the ends of the tube, if needed. Select your filler. Hammer nails through the tube. Poke toothpicks through the tube. Fill the tube with coiled aluminum foil. Cap one end of the tube. Pour the filler into the the tube. Test the rainstick and add more filler if needed. Cap the other end of the tube.
Ginger Lilies are hardy in zones 7-10 and need be pruned differently to other lilies. These plants spread very quickly, so pruning them back and deadheading is an important way of controlling the spread of this plant in your garden.   Cut off the old growth and dig up any new growth that emerges in the spring if you want to contain the spread.  In spring, cut back any damaged stalks, along with the remainder of any stalks that flowered the previous year. Remove any brown or yellow growth.   Ginger lilies can be deadheaded to prevent the plant reseeding itself, but this does nothing to promote continuous flower production. If you want to prevent the spread of new growth, you will have to dig up the plant from the bulb each spring.  Ginger lilies use their foliage to protect themselves over the winter months. If you prefer to remove it for aesthetic reasons, it’s okay to cut foliage back in the fall to a few inches above the ground.   However, it's especially important to mulch the soil over the plant thickly before winter sets in, in order to replace the protection of the foliage.	Understand that ginger lilies are much more prone to spreading that other lily varieties. Cut back old or damaged stalks each spring. Protect the bulbs throughout the winter if you plan on cutting back their foliage.
You can install a new sink with basic tools and new components that match the valves already installed in your plumbing. Make sure you have:   Silicone caulking Plumbers' wrenches, either pipe wrench or slip-joint pliers Basin wrench Set of plumbing sockets; , Typically located beneath the sink, it's critical that you shut off the water supply to the sink before you remove it. If the valves are not beneath the sink, then you'll have to turn off the main water supply. This is typically located on a lower level or the basement near the water meter.   To test, turn on the hot and cold water on your sink and make sure no water comes out before proceeding.  If you're replacing a sink, you'll obviously need to remove the sink that's in place before installing the new one. Disconnect the supply and drain lines from the faucet, using locking pliers or a crescent wrench. A small amount of water may leak out when you do this, which is normal. Just use a bucket or a towel to handle the water that leaks out.   Locate the large nut that connects the sink to the drain and disconnect it. This metal or plastic nut will be located either in the wall or the floor. Use your hands or locking pliers to unscrew the nut. Remove the current sink by sliding the edge of a putty knife around the perimeter of the bathroom sink, loosening any caulk that connects it. Pull it loose.  All new sinks should come with a template of the mounting opening, marking the location of the faucet holes, including a cutout for the sink. You can use the template to make sure the sink fits in the desired location. If it doesn’t, you may need to do some trimming or, or cut the entire opening if you're installing a sink in a house under construction.   Most new sinks come with clips and screws that are used to hold the sink in place. If you buy a faucet, sometimes it’ll come with the drain and tailpiece for the sink. If it isn’t included, get one before you start. The supply lines for the faucet need to correspond to the faucet and valves under the sink, so make sure they match before you get started.  Put a thin bead of silicone around the bottom lip of the sink and set it into the hole. Clean up any excess silicone or smooth a line. Depending on the design of the sink and the opening where it connects to the plumbing lines, you may need to caulk in any number of different places.   For undermount sinks, put a bead of silicone under, have someone hold the sink in place, and install the connecting clips included with the sink. You might have to pre-drill holes with a diamond carbide tip if you’re installing the sink in a granite/stone counter.  Connective clips are often included with new sinks to help anchor the units into place, in addition to the sealing caulk. The design of this varies, and will depend on the type of sink and the design, but they usually act like a lever to hold the sink in place. Follow the instructions included with the new sink and defer to the manufacturer's guidelines.  New faucets usually screw onto the faucet assembly in a clockwise direction. Some faucets will have a rubber gasket around the base, and screw on easily, while others will recommend using silicone sealant to secure to the sink or counter. You can anchor the faucet by reaching up underneath and using lock nuts that are included with the installation kit.   Sometimes it may be easier to install the faucet before the sink, depending on the design of the counter and the fixtures. Make sure the space for the faucet matches the location of the sink, using the template to measure before you install anything.  Drop the tailpiece through the sink and screw on the tailpiece nut from underneath. Some sinks come with gaskets that go between sink and tailpiece. If it doesn’t, use non-hardening plumbers' putty or silicone to create the seal. Install the gasket, the included cardboard washer, and the locknut to secure the tailpiece.  There are three common sizes: half-inch pipe thread, which is a coarser thread used on single-handle sinks, ½ or 5/8ths compression, and 3/8ths compression, which is a different type of thread commonly used on end valves, and intended to provide leak-free seal over hard copper.   If your sink comes with lines and they don’t match to valves, you can get additional lines that will match. If you put two pipe threads together, splice them with teflon tape.  Water supply lines should screw into place with the corresponding joints on the new faucet. The specific size of the connectors should be included in the instructions for the specific faucet that you're installing.   You want to get lines that will have the appropriate ends for valve end and faucet end. Lines also need to be long enough so you won’t put stress on the joints. Better to have extra long lines and have them loop. No hard bends or kinks. Make them hand tight, and somewhere around a quarter to half turn with a wrench. Usually the "female" connection piece on both ends will always have rubber gaskets, so you don’t need teflon tape.  The pop-up is the device that allows you to open and close the sink drain, usually made of a simple metal rod with ball attached to it. Drop stopped into sink from top, slide short end of rod into the opening on the tailpiece, making sure that the opening for the ball is facing toward the lever for the pop-up. Install as per the instructions.   Sometimes you need washers and sometimes you don’t. Slide nut to trap the ball in the tailpiece. Tighten so there’s no wiggle, but not so tight that it’s difficult to raise and lower. Attach thumbscrew to pop-up lever rod while sliding the rod from the ball so they can attach and allow you to screw together.  Finish with silicon around the top of the sink, anywhere that the basin of the sink meets the wall, filling any gaps with a thin bead of caulk. Let the caulk dry for about 24 hours before turning on the water and going back over your work to check for leaks.  There’s no way to know if something is going to leak until you turn the water on. If you have small leaks from the rubber connections, try tightening more. The drain itself will also sometimes leak, which can be caused by over-tightening and straining the seal created by the connector gaskets. If that’s leaking, don’t go past hand tight. Try a new washer instead. It's also a good idea to check the gasket that goes under the tailpiece. Try tightening the nut down more or try different washer or silicone.	Get the necessary tools for the job. Turn off the water supply valves. Remove the old sink, if necessary. Measure the new sink to make sure it fits the space. Put the sink in place and caulk it. Secure the sink with clips. Install the faucet. Install the tailpiece and drain kit. Make sure the water lines match the new fixture. Connect the water supply lines. Connect the pop-up. Seal your connections with silicone caulk. Turn on the water and check for leaks.
You're going to be right down by the wheels, so make sure that they can't roll!       ; , Lugnuts are the small, hexagonal screws holding the tire onto the car. This may take some effort if the lug nuts are tight. Once loose, you can unscrew them by hand. If you're really struggling, you can apply pressure to the wrench with your foot to really get them off.          A lug wrench looks like a crowbar with a circular hole in it. It should be in your trunk with the car, but make sure you have one if not. They are also needed to change a tire.  Lugnuts hold both the wheel and the hubcap on, and you don't want the whole wheel coming off. Take care to put the lug nuts somewhere safe so you do not lose them.          If you have five total lugnuts, take off two that are next to each other and one on the opposite side.  These are what keep the hubcaps on, not just the lug nuts. Set them aside somewhere safe -- you'll need them.  You don't need to completely tighten them on, just to hand tightness. Then use the lug wrench to tighten them just a quarter turn more or so. These three will keep the tire in place as you remove the other two washers.  Without the washers, the hubcap should slide right off.  There will be a small cut out that needs to fit over the valve of the tire. Line this up, then slide the new hubcap on and tighten on the two nuts. Just tighten them by hand for now -- don't worry about full tightness.  Tighten them back on by hand so that your tire is back where it started. You can also slip the washers over the section         , Tighten them all by hand at first. Then, working in a circle, tighten them each one quarter-turn at a time until they don't want to move too much. Never tighten one screw completely before moving on to the others -- this can bend or warp the hubcap.	Pull up the e-brake and park the car somewhere flat and level. Turn one lug nut counterclockwise with a lug wrench to loosen it. Take three of the lug nuts off the hubcap, keeping two nuts on opposite sides on the tire. Remove the plastic washers from the lugnuts. Reattach the three lugnuts, tightening them lightly. Unscrew the other two lugnuts to remove the hubcap. Place the new hubcap onto the bolts and replace the two lugnuts. Remove the first three lug nuts, put the washers back on, and screw them in. Tighten the lug nuts with the crowbar to ensure a tight fit.

You'll need a can with both ends cut out and a small hole nailed into the side, packaging tape and scissors.       ; , Stagger strips of tape to completely cover the top and bottom holes of the can tightly.  Add another layer to be sure that you covered all possible holes.  You can now hit the drum to create the basic sounds. A stick will work better than your fingers.	Gather your materials. Cover the top and bottom holes. And another layer. Done.
You will need about three yards of fabric to make this dress. The best fabric types you can pick will be ones that are stretchy and drape well. Polyesters or knits are both good choices.  Like all clothing, tailoring your dress to exactly what you need will make it look its best. You will need just two measurements before beginning:   Your waist at its smallest part. The length from your waist to where you want the bottom of the dress to be. This will be its skirt length., Fold your fabric in half once and lay it on a flat surface. If your fabric is rectangular, make the fold along its length. From one of the two parallel free edges, use measuring tape to measure out the skirt length you determined earlier. Make sure the tape is straight and parallel to the long edge, not diagonal. Mark the skirt length on both sides of the fabric using either fabric chalk or straight pins. Cut straight across along these marks using sharp fabric scissors., Take the free long edges of your skirt and sew them together. The result should be a long tube.Many fabrics, especially ones with patterns, have only one side meant to be visible in the final garment. If your fabric is like this, sew the nicer sides together facing each other. You will flip the tube right-side-out later.  Make a wide and loose stitch about half an inch from what will be the top of your skirt. Sew it completely around the tube. When you're finished, gently tug on one of the thread ends.This will "gather" the skirt, creating a slightly ruffled appearance.   Do not trim the edges of the string until the complete dress has been sewn together. If you trim it now, the gather stitch will come undone., On a section of fabric, measure and mark what will be your waistband. This will need to be a strip that is six inches wide and one half to one third of your waist measurement.   If your fabric isn't very stretchy, use your actual waist measurement instead. The more stretchy the fabric, the shorter this piece should be., Make the fold lengthwise. Then, sew the two shorter ends together. Make sure your stitches include all four layers of fabric., You will need two long strips of fabric to create the transformable "wrap" part of your dress. The length and width of these strips will be determined by your figure.   The straps' widths should be around 10 inches (25 cm) for a smaller chest, 12 inches (30.5 cm) for an average chest, and 14 inches (35.6 cm) for a large chest. You can make them wider if you would like your dress to have more coverage. Strap length should correlate with your height. If you are on the short side, make them around 85 inches (216 cm) long. Those of average height should use 95 inches (240 cm) and taller people will need about 105 inches. If you are unsure about how long they should be, add a few inches and trim after assembling your dress if needed., Place the two straps with one short edge flush with the top of your skirt. Position the straps so that they overlap each other slightly by roughly a half inch. Make sure that the unfolded straps lay parallel to the length of the skirt rather than in the opposite direction. Sew the straps to the skirt along the top edge., Pin the waistband around the top of the skirt so that the bottom of the waistband is upside-down and flush with the top of the skirt. Sew the two pieces together.   Position the seam in the front center of the dress so that it will be hidden by the straps when worn.The waistband will be smaller than the top of the skirt. Gently stretch the waistband while sewing to properly line it up and give a snug fit.  Once you've finished sewing, flip the waistband up and inward. Your dress is now ready to wear.   One style is to wear the dress at the waist with the straps pulled over your chest and around the back of your neck. You can pair the dress with a similarly-colored tube top for more coverage.	Find your fabric. Take your measurements. Mark and cut out your skirt piece. Sew the sides of your skirt together. Sew a gather stitch near the top. Mark and cut out your waistband piece. Fold the waistband in half and sew it into a circle. Mark and cut your straps. Attach the straps to the skirt. Add the waistband. Invert the waistband and wear.
The height of your cone will be determined by the radius of your circle. The larger the radius, the taller the cone. You can print the template in the document above, and trace the shape onto the paper you want to use. If you choose to make your own disc, do your best to make the shape as round as possible.   Improper measurements will have a big effect on your cone's result. It's a good idea to put extra effort into making the circle as round as possible. For your disk shape, you can also use a compass, or trace a round object, such as a lid or container.  Use the template to cut out two sides from the circle to make your wedge. To draw your own wedge, make a mark in the center of the disc. Draw out two straight lines from the center point to make a wedge with your ruler. If the lines are closer together it will make a smaller wedge which will result in a cone with a broad bottom.   Use a compass protractor to pinpoint the centre of your disc if you're unsure where to place your dot. If you're using a protractor tool to outline the disc to begin with, it can save you time to make the centre dot before you trace the disc around it. You can also draw your own triangle wedge using a ruler and pencil.  To make a cone with a small bottom, cut out a larger triangle wedge. Use scissors or a precision knife to cut out your wedge as straight as possible. If you run into any cutting mishaps, you will probably need to start over again., For your cone shape, bring one cut end of your disc over to the other in a cone shape. Hold it together and make sure the lower ridge of both sides overlap evenly. With this, your disc should have the desired cone shape you're looking for.   Unfurl the paper and try again if the sides don't meet properly at first. Don't make firm creases in your paper. Your cone should be rounded.  Once you tape the two sides side by side so that the paper makes a cone. Tape the inside of the cone by bridging the two sides so that they slightly overlap and bridging the overlap with tape. With that done, your cone should be ready to go.  One straight piece of tape will give your cone the best stability. Multiple pieces of tape inside will make a mess. It is helpful to have one hand applying the tape while the other holds the shape of the cone.	Make a paper disk. Draw a triangle wedge. Cut the triangle wedge out of the circle. Bring the cut sides of your disc together. Tape the inside of the cone closed.
You'll be making a simple dough, much like Play-Doh. You'll need:   6 cups of flour 2 cups of water 4 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil 2 Cups of Salt An old plastic water bottle, cut in half. Food Coloring (optional); , Through all of the ingredients into the same bowl so that you can mix them up. It can help to pre-sift the flour with a whisk, sift, or fork to get break up big chunks.  Adding the food coloring to the water will help it distribute evenly, meaning your whole volcano will be the same color, not streaky.          If you don't want to add food color, you can paint the volcano with acrylic poster colors after setting up the clay.  Mix and then knead until a dough is formed. Get squishy, molding and mixing until you have a bit yellow ball of dough. You can use a rubber spatula to help get it off the sides of the bowl, but use your hands to form a nice, consistent ball.Make sure the clay is neither too watery nor too dry. It should be in a format which allows us to shape it.          If the dough is dry as you work, add a tablespoon or so of water. If it is wet, through in a little more flour.  You want it to be wet enough to work with, but not so dry that it crumbles or falls apart. You can always add a touch more water if need be, but try to be sparing.  Lay down a sheet of wax paper, a thick layer of newspaper, or a box or tray which you can line with tinfoil.  This container will be the center of your volcano. You can use lots of different containers like soda cans, mason jars, plastic bottles, and so on.  Starting from the bottom and working your way up, place your clay around the volcano to form the outside. Try to make it lumpy and uneven, since volcanoes rarely look like perfect cones!         , Shape your volcano first and then let the dough set. As this is technically playdough (rather than clay), you will want to let it set for about 24 hrs to get dry and hard before completing your project. If you're in a hurry, put it in the oven for about an hour on low heat to dry it out quicker.   Do not forget to paint your volcano when done!,, Add red food coloring to the vinegar. Mix in a tablespoon of dish washing soap to add an extra bubbly final effect!         , Using a funnel might make this easier.  The toilet paper will dissolve, exposing the baking soda to the vinegar. This will cause the volcano to erupt!	Round up the ingredients for the volcano from the kitchen. Pour the salt, flour, and oil into the mixing bowl. Pour the water into a large mixing bowl, adding 2-3 drops of food coloring if wanted. Mix and kneed the ingredients with your hands. Let the dough dry for 1-2 hours before shaping. Create a protective surface. Get your lava container. Shape your clay. Allow the volcano to dry overnight, or cook it for one hour at 225F. Put the baking soda in the volcano.         , Prepare some vinegar. Add the vinegar mixture into the container. Run away!

Most people use drawing applications on their computers or purchase commercial storyboard software.   Drawing applications will allow users to sketch directly on the computer screen using a mouse or stylus and makes frames easy to delete, modify or rearrange. Some applications also allow you to add extensive notes under each frame or image. Commercial storyboard software will usually already have templates for you to use and include numerous built-in tools designed specifically for commercial production.	Determine your digital method for creating a storyboard.
How to care for your plant will depend on what climate you live in and how you wish the plant to look. Roses in zones 4 and 5 (where temperatures dip to -30 degrees F and -34.4 degrees C) may need protection during the winter. Consider planting your roses near covered areas and bushes.   Roses in the hotter zones will need shade to protect them from wilting in the summer heat.  Plant your rose in a sheltered area with moderate sun. Since Lenton roses prefer alkaline soiland areas near trees and large plants, look for a spot where shrubs and bushes grow naturally. Such spots may be near a large tree, in the corner of the garden, or near a pond.  Alkaline soil with a pH of 7.6 to 8.5 is ideal for Lenton roses. Buy a soil pH test kit at your local garden center and test the pH of your soil. Be sure to use soil that you dig up from 4 inches (10.2 cm) below the surface to get a good sample. Wear gloves while collecting your soil. Touching the sample with your hands could influence the pH. Break up the soil and allow it to dry.   Put the dried soil into a clean container. Put distilled water and the chemical that comes in the test kit into the container with the soil. Shake up the container then and then let the soil settle. Check the color of the water in the container against the chart that comes with the kit to determine what the pH of your soil is.  The amount of lime necessary depends on the texture of the soil and how much the pH needs to be changed. If the soil is sandy, 1 ¼ pounds of lime will be required to change the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 6.8 to 7.8. Heavy clay soil will require 2 ¾ pounds of lime to make the same change.   Work the lime into the soil to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) if the Lenton rose has not already been planted. If it is already growing in the garden, gently work the lime into the top few inches of soil around the plant.  Lenton roses grow best in organically rich, fertile soil that drains quickly. If the Lenton rose has not yet been planted, work a 3- to 6-inch depth of organic matter like well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss or leaf mold into the soil. Work it in thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).   If the Lenton rose has already been planted, gently work the organic matter into the top 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil around the rose. Be careful not to damage its roots. The organic matter will improve the texture, fertility and drainage capabilities of the soil.  Dig a hole twice the size of the plant. Place a layer of peat moss in the hole and then place the roots directly above the moss. The plant have at least three inches of topsoil over its roots to help it survive during the winter months.   Leave the stem clear when returning the soil to the hole. This will encourage growth while discouraging diseases from affecting your rose.	Consider your environment. Select a site that gets moderate amounts of sun. Test the pH of your soil. Add lime to the soil to make it more alkaline if the pH is too low. Add organic matter to your soil. Dig a hole for your rose.
Once you have perfected a couple songs, it’s time to lay down the tracks. After all, you can't sell your music if you don’t have anything recorded, but thanks to advancing technologies, most small towns these days have their own recording studios where musicians can go to record a few tracks or entire albums at relatively low prices.   Check online to see if there are any local recording studios in your town, as the added quality of a semi-professional recording could make all the difference when you're trying to get people to pay for your music. Simply search for “recording studios” and the name of the city where you live, and all the nearest studios will be listed.; , These days, music is sold through different avenues, and each of these requires a different format. For instance, you can sell physical copies of your music on CDs or vinyl at concerts, but you'll need digital versions if you want to sell your music online and through electronic stores.   When you go in to record your tracks, get them pressed onto CDs and onto vinyl if possible, and keep digital versions of everything as well.  There are a multitude of digital music stores out there, and many of them have their own music apps that are used by different mobile devices—such as iTunes for Apple, Google Play for Android devices, Band Camp, and Amazon Music. As an artist, you can sell your music directly through these media.Some of these digital stores make it difficult for individuals to sell their music, and prefer that musicians use third-party networks. To sell music through iTunes, for instance, you need an Apple ID, a Universal Product Code, an International Standard Recording Code, and a U.S. tax ID., These types of networks specialize in partnering with digital music stores and streaming services, and when you sell your music to these affiliates, you're paying for them to get your music sold through the most popular digital avenues. Moreover, these sites will be able to deal with all the red tape involved in selling your music digitally, and will format your music to the various specifications of different stores.Some of the more popular digital distribution networks include:   Ditto Songcast TuneCore Awal  , Just as digital music stores are places where you can sell your own music to people around the world, so too are there digital stores dedicated to selling beats, samples, and instrumental music. Like the digital stores and distribution networks, some of these sites work on a subscription basis while others are pay-per-tune. The most popular music production sales sites include:   Soundgine My Flash Store Beat Stars Firstdub  , You can sell copies of your records to people the same way people buy clothes online. When somebody purchases your album, they also pay shipping and taxes, and then you mail a physical copy of your record to their address. You can do this through your own website if you have one, your Facebook page, or through sites like CDBaby.   CDBaby makes their money by taking a cut of every sale, but they can also convert digital copies of your music into CD formats.  There are many venues where independent artists can sell their own music, and this includes local shows and concerts, coffee shops, art galleries, and markets. Some places, like coffee shops, may ask for a small fee in return for managing your display, while farmer’s markets might require you to pay for a booth.   If you're looking for other venues through which to sell your music, ask around in the local arts and music scene to find businesses that are open to helping out local artists, and approach those businesses and ask if you can set up a display to sell records.  When you want to make a living as a musician, you must reach as many people as possible an promote yourself all the time, because the more fans you have, the more people there are to buy your music. These days, one of the best ways to reach new fans is through social media and having friends, family, and fans share your music with others.Along with having accounts with all the popular social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Myspace, to name a few), you should also update them regularly and share your songs, performances, and videos there.  While social media and digital marketing are important, you still have to get out there and perform all the time. Think outside the box when you're looking for gigs, and try to book yourself at events like weddings, parties, and charity events, along with the traditional concerts, shows, and club performances.   By performing in front of live audiences, you will build a stronger fan following, develop a solid local market, and each show will bring more exposure and new fans., This is a more traditional way of getting your music out there, and it is still important for artists to get airplay. When you send your demo, be sure to address a specific DJ, and try to target a person that tends to play music in your genre. Today, however, musicians aren't limited to local radio stations, so also send a few of your tracks to:College and university stations Web radio stations Satellite radio stations Music bloggers  , Agents are great because it’s their job to help make you more popular and get you paying gigs. Not only that, but if you're looking to get signed, agents are a huge asset because they have connections within the industry.   An agent’s job is to negotiate for you, find and book performances, and arrange show details, among other tasks.Many of the larger labels don’t accept unsolicited demos, so an agent can get your foot in the door., This is only necessary if you want to sign a record deal with an actual label, which isn't strictly necessary these days. But a record label will help take care of promoting your music and selling records, which will take some of the pressure off you.   If you do want to get signed with an existing label, send copies of your best work to producers and executives at the labels you want to work with.Don’t forget about digital record labels and netlabels such as 8Bitpeoples and Monstercat.

This is the most important part. The kids of the FAYZ eventually run out of options in their wardrobe.; ,, Again, try to find grungy ones. Preferably pants, since the FAYZ is known to be extremely cold at night.  Kids in Perdido Beach tend to cling to old fashion trends or possessions. Wear pins, bracelets, sunglasses, gloves, etc.  Wear old, mismatched shoes, like an old sneaker and a sandal.  Keep it messy. Wear a hat, a totally random hat (examples: a top hat, a work hat, a beanie, etc.). , The FAYZ is not a happy, loving place. Nearly everyone over the age of five carries a weapon. Carry a toy mace or a lightsaber. Nothing literally dangerous.  Lots of kids wear random items they found. Things like too much makeup, a bandana, a cape, or a mask.	Mismatch. First, find a loose, crummy shirt, that does not suit most anything (an old stained one or one too bright).  , Get raggedy shorts or jeans. Get ready to accessorize. Shoes. Hair. Since the kids like to cling to memories their past lives, carry around an old toy or magazine; carry something that would mean a lot to you in the Gone universe.  , Weapons. Wear something different that stands out.
Do not break into a car unless you own it and have documentation to prove it. Be aware that forced entry will set an alarm if the vehicle is equipped.   This method, and in fact most methods of hot wiring a car, will only work on cars older than the mid-90s. Newer models are equipped with a whole host of locking mechanisms in place to keep you from hot-wiring the car unless you're intimately familiar with the quirks of the model. If you try this on a 2002 Honda Civic, you're likely to end up setting off alarms and locking the starter, meaning no one can drive it. If you have access to the owner's manual, check to make sure the steering column and gear selector can be overridden. Serious damage to the shifting mechanism and steering column can result from this method.; , These are usually held in place with concealed clips or #2 Phillips-type screws. Remove them and pull the access panels free.   Alternatively, on some much older models, you can break the locking pins in the ignition by hammering a flathead screwdriver into the keyhole and turning it over. It's very difficult--if not impossible--to do this by hand, but if you think the model is sufficiently old to allow for it, you can give it a shot.  Once you remove the panels on the steering column, you should see a roil of electrical wires. Don't be intimidated, learn to recognize the right bundle. There will typically be three main bundles of wires:   Wires leading to the column-mounted controls on one side, like lights, cruise control, and other indicators Wires leading to the column controls on the other side, like wipers or seat warmers Wires leading to the the battery, ignition, and starter leading straight up the steering column  , One of these will be the primary power supply for the ignition switch, one will be ignition wires, and the other will be the starter. The other colors will vary depending on the manufacturer. Read the owner's manual or look online to be sure you can identify all possibilities.   Sometimes the ignition wires are brown and the starter wires yellow, but the battery wires are most usually red. Again, the only way to be sure is to read the owner's manual. You're not MacGyver; messing with the wrong wires will get you electrocuted.  Wrap them with electrician's tape if available, and do not allow them to short against metal vehicle components. Connecting these will provide electricity for the ignition components, so the engine is able to run when the starter is turned.  You should see the dash lights and other electrical components come alive at this point. If all you want to do is listen to the radio, you're done. If you want to drive the car, you'll need to spark the starter wire, which can get dangerous., This will be live, so you need to extremely careful and keep close hold of your bare wires. Touch the end of this to the connected battery wires. Don't try to twist it on, just spark it against the battery wires to start the car.  If you get the car to start, rev it a few times so you don't stall out and have to do this process again.   Once the engine starts, you can detach the starter wire and continue on your way. When you want to kill the engine, simply unfasten the battery wires from the ignition wires and the car will die., You've got the car started and you're ready to get your engine pumping and let your car loose, right? Wrong. While your car is running, the steering column is probably locked at this point, meaning that you'll have to break it to be able to steer, unless you want to drive straight off a cliff or something.   On some models, all you'll need to do is pop off the metal keyhole which will release a spring and break the lock. If you already tried to jam your screwdriver in there earlier because you've got a mid-70s to mid-80s vehicle, the lock is probably already broken. Some models respond well to a healthy dose of elbow grease. Crank the wheel hard to either side as if you were trying to twist it free. You could also use a hammer to fix in the wheel and use for leverage. You should hear it break and the wheel will be free, so you'll be able to drive normally.	Enter the car. Remove the plastic cover on the steering column. Find the wiring harness connector. Pull aside the battery, ignition, and starter wire bundle. Strip about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of insulation from the battery wires and twist them together. Connect the ignition on/off wire to the battery wire. Being extremely careful, strip the starter wire about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Rev the engine. Break the steering lock.
It's easiest to learn where the front and back of your car is if you have a friend on hand. They can provide you with a visual cue for you to guesstimate how far the back or front of your car is., Park the car in the driveway or somewhere off the road. You want space for a person to walk around your car without worrying about being hit by another car. Turn the car off.  Ask her to go to the front. Now, have her move until you think she's at the front bumper. Tell her to mark the space with a piece of tape. Ask her to go to the back. Have her move until you think she's at the back bumper. Have her mark it with a piece of tape.  Go look, and see how close you were when you had her move. If you were off, get back in the car. Have her stand at the front and back exactly at the bumper, so you get an idea of the length of your car.  Another way to learn how long your car is to use glassed store fronts when you're trying to parallel park. The next time you try to parallel park, look at your car in the store window. Compare what you see in the window to where you think your car actually ends.  If you're just learning a 3-point turn, pick an area that's free from traffic. Try an empty parking lot or an abandoned road.  Look in both directions to make sure you have enough time to make a turn without a car running into you.In addition, pick a point in the road where drivers can clearly see you from a distance. That means you shouldn't make a three-point turn near a curve or a hill, as it can block you from other drivers' view., Usually, a two-way road is enough room to make a three-point turn. In addition, you shouldn't have enough room to make u-turn; if you do, you should use a u-turn, as it is quicker and therefore, safer., Switch on your right turn signal. Look in your mirrors to make sure no one is speeding up behind you. Also, tap your brakes to alert anyone behind you. Once it's safe to do so, pull over to the side of the road. Stop about half a foot from the curb.  Since you will be going across the road, you need to turn on your left turn signal. Also, check again to make sure no one is coming on the road.You'll need at least 20 seconds to complete your turn, so make sure no one is coming too quickly.  Move your car like you're making a left turn on to a road. However, instead of continuing on like you normally would, stop about half a foot from the side the road. Right now, you should be facing the side of the road. Your car should be perpendicular to how the road is running.  Put on your right turn signal. Put the car in reverse, and check for traffic. Make sure you have the space and time to continue with the maneuver. Turn the steering wheel all the way to the right.Maneuver the car backwards slowly. Keep going until your about half a foot from the other side of the road. Your car should now be angled in the direction you are wanting to go.  Look for traffic again. When it's clear, drive your car onto the correct side of the road, now fully turned around.  That is, sometimes you need to turn a three-point turn into a multi-point turn. If the road is especially narrow, you may need to back up and move forward more than once, as you run out of room to angle your car. Take as many points as you need, as long as the road is clear. If it's not, try to find a better place to turn around.	Grab a friend. Park your car someplace safe. Have your friend get out of the car. Get out of the car. Use glassed store fronts. Pick a quiet area to practice. Make sure the road is clear. Make sure you have enough space to turn around. Pull over to the right side of the road. Switch on your left turn signal. Turn to the left. Reverse the other direction. Put your car in drive. Remember that three-point turns sometimes require more points.

Organize in advance what you will need to take with you to the theater such as a light jacket, your tickets, a pair of opera glasses or reading glasses, if you need them. These are items you may want to consider bringing with you to a performance to ensure your viewing pleasure.  Prepare children if you will be attending a performance with them. Remind them about needing to stay quiet and seated. Consider bringing some small, noiseless toys such as a favorite stuffed animal or a little figurine that can help to entertain if needed.  No one can enjoy a live performance if they constantly thinking about how hungry they are. Plan on having a meal prior to your performance at a nearby restaurant. NYC.com offers a list of restaurants near the theater district with reviews and the option of making reservations. Schedule in a meal before the show., It is recommended to arrive approximately 30 minutes before the start of the show.

Arrive early. Come prepared to purchase souvenirs.
Combine it with something else, perhaps. Your favorite candy bar? The name of your girlfriend from high school? Your hometown? These are all words you could add into a band name or just use as one. Having meaning behind your brand name can be important when it comes to publicity. You want your band name to have a good story, such as Led Zeppelin has. (Keith Moon of The Who heard one of their gigs and stated that they would go over like a lead balloon- in British English, a Lead Zeppelin.) They kept the idea but changed the spelling. Make a list of your favorite people, places, and things. Do this without thinking too hard. You may find a good band name in that list (especially if you combine a few of the words).  These can have staying power. A famous example is the band Veruca Salt, which took its name from the book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.   Mikey Way was working in Barnes and Noble and saw the book by Irvine Welsh entitled "Three Tales of Chemical Romance," then came up with My Chemical Romance. Good Charlotte also got their name from the book "Good Charlotte." Matthew Sanders got the name Avenged Sevenfold from the Book of Genesis in the Bible. There was actually a band called Natalie Portman’s Shaved Head. Not surprisingly, it ended up changing its name. Naming a band after a better known celebrity is rarely a good idea; basing it on a dated reference is more problematic. Use a song lyric. Panic At The Disco were inspired by the song "Panic" by Name Taken, and All Time Low got their name from the song "Head On Collision" by New Found Glory.  Flowers. Food. Sewing machines. You name it. Look around the house. You’ll find a lot of common things with interesting names.   Malcolm and Angus Young from AC/DC found their band name on a sewing machine. AC/DC (Meaning: Alternating Current/Direct Current) was printed on the back. They decided to use that. Food names can also make good band names. Think Black-eyed Peas or Red Hot Chili Peppers.  There are different ways you can pick random names. Sometimes bands will randomly flip through a dictionary. That's what REM, The Pixies, Incubus, The Grateful Dead, Evanescence and Outkast did. Apoptygma Berzerk did as well, using two randomly found words.   Use a band name generator. Some online sites will put together random words to generate lists of potential band names for you. The downside of a name generator is that you’re not tapping into your own creativity. And your band name won’t be something with meaning. Still, random names can generate inspired pairings. A randomly creative name might be more unique. Some of the best band names consist of putting two words together that have nothing to do with each other. Think: Pearl Jam. You can also just brainstorm random words that you think sound cool. And then put them together. Or put them together to create a new word (like Nickelback).  This is always a possibility, especially if your band has a front man. For example, the Dave Matthews Band is simply based on a band member’s name – and it works.   There is risk to this name choice. If your brand changes the frontman, it will be tough to continue with the same name. Van Halen is an example. The other problem with such a name is that some band members might feel left out. If you choose your own name, you might want to add to it to make it more interesting. Or just use your last name.  You could create a new word that is a combination of parts of other words. Perhaps this new word (or phrase) will have some kind of significant meaning to you.   Metallica is an example of a band with a name that is a made-up word. Drummer Lars Ulrich made it up while thinking about a metal magazine. Create a new word by misspelling a common word, like Korn. Some bands combine parts of their hometowns’ names with other pieces of words. However, you might be called out as a fake if you choose a place name from somewhere you’re not really from. A band might name itself after a neighborhood in its hometown. Examples are Soundgarden, Linkin Park, Hawthorne Heights, Alter Bridge, or Cypress Hill (misspelling is optional).	Find a word with meaning to you. Use a pop culture or literary reference. Get inspiration from common products or things. Pick a random name. Use your own name (or your initials). Make up a new word.
Check if your address is handwritten or poorly typed and if it contains any misspellings of common words, such as your street name or your city. You should also note if your name is misspelled or not specified on the package, as this may indicate the sender may be suspicious.You should also note if there is no return address on the package or a strange return address that you do not recognize. A suspicious package may also be marked with certain restrictions like “Personal”, “Confidential” or “Do not x-ray”. You should also note if there is any threatening language on the package, such as “Beware of contents”.; , Examine the outside of the package for any powdery substances on the envelope or wrapping. Lightly hold the package and feel through the wrapping or the envelope for any powdery substances. You may also notice oily stains or discoloration on the outside of the package.Note if the package has a strange or strong odor, as this may indicate there is a suspicious substance in the package. Try to smell the package quickly and only once, as you do not want to inhale or come in contact with any substances in the package.  Hold the package in your hands and check if it is very heavy or has excessive weight to it. You should also check for any ticking noises or sounds coming from the package and any protruding wires or aluminum foil coming out of the package.Be cautious if the package has excessive packaging material like layers of masking tape, string, and/or glue, as this may indicate the sender did not want to make it easy for you to determine what is in the package.  If you believe the package may be suspicious, it is important that you do not shake, open, or empty the contents of the package. You should also avoid carrying the package or showing it to others to examine.If you determine it is suspicious, do not sniff, touch, taste, or look at any of the contents.  Let anyone else known in the residence, home, or area, that you believe you have received a suspicious package. Place the package on a stable surface and leave the area. Make sure anyone else in the area also evacuates and do not allow anyone to enter the area with the suspicious package.If you have a ventilation system, like an air conditioner system or a heating system, turn it off so the contents of the package cannot circulate in the area.  Give your hands a good wash with soap and water to prevent spreading any potentially dangerous substances to your face or skin. Once law enforcement officials arrive, they will be able to give you additional instructions on dealing with exposure to potentially dangerous substances., If you are at work, contact your supervisor or a security officer. Let them know you believe you have received a suspicious package and that they need to call local law enforcement.If you are at home, use your cellphone or a neighbor’s phone to call your local law enforcement and report the suspicious package. Try to make a list of the people who were in the room or area where the suspicious package was recognized and anyone who many have handled the suspicious package. You should provide this list to local law enforcement when they arrive on the scene.	Note the labeling and postage on the package. Look for any powdery substances or oily stains on the outside of the package. Check for excessive weight, ticking sounds, or protruding wires. Do not shake or open the package. Alert others in the area and leave the package on a stable surface. Wash your hands. Call your local law enforcement agency.
To start with your piece you first have to crochet a chain of stitches before you crochet the loops that the pattern calls for.  You will have to practice holding the wire and needle in a way that the wire won't bend unnecessarily until you are comfortable and feels natural.   Although, the principle of crocheting with yarn and wire is similar, wire behaves differently. You will find that even though you may have experience crocheting yarn, the properties of wire will require you to handle it differently.  Wire hardens slightly when it is bent and can also create kinks that will make your pattern sloppy and uneven.   Hold the wire straight between your forefinger and middle finger sliding it instead. Pinch the end with your thumb and the other two fingers pulling just enough to create the tension needed to keep the wire straight from the spool. To maintain the tension needed for good even stitches you must secure the spool allowing it to slowly unwind and reel it in towards you using your forefinger and middle-finger. You are now ready to cast on and begin to crochet.  Leaving at least a 4 inch tail at the end, loop the wire twice around your forefinger and middle finger.Then, with the crochet hook grab one piece of the wire and pull it through the loop towards you. Pull from the tail end until it tightens around your hook. You just made the slipknot.  The wire should be under the crochet hook and twisting counterclockwise coil the wire around it so that it begins to bend into a loop.   Once the wire takes the circular shape twisted around your crochet hook, you can pull it towards you through the loop hole. You have made your first wire chain stitch.  You may have to lay them down and flatten it to keep the shape neat.  With one loop on your hook stick the crochet hook through the chain stitch loop and catch & coil the wire and pull through both loops towards you. You made your first wire slip-stitch.    Keep checking your loops with the wide part of the crochet hook often to maintain the pattern shape.	Plan the right number of stitches for the pattern of the piece you intend to make. Cut out a 18 - 24 inch strand of wire. Do not wind the wire on your pinkie or bend it around your forefinger. Tie a slip knot. Holding the wire with one hand and the hook with the other stick the crochet hook through the slipknot and grab the wire with your hook. Continue making the desired number of chain stitches and checking the diameter of each loop using the wide part of the crochet hook to keep an uniform shape. Turn your work and slip stitch a row. Repeat until you finish the slip stitch row. Keep practicing until you can also crochet more intricate stitches like single crochet, Half double crochet, Double crochet, Treble crochet, etc.
, Look over your stock system. Is it in good shape or maybe needs something simple, like replacing a hanger or tailpipe? Either leave it alone or do minor repairs. If it is stock, what you have is better than anything on the market., You might be able to do the work without jack stands or ramps. The cardboard will keep any crud that comes off the old system from getting on your driveway while protecting the new system from getting scratched up – scratches through the paint can make it rust faster., This may be as simple as removing the bolts at the flanges, then removing the hangar bolts and lowering it to the ground. Some penetrating lubricant on the nuts may help loosen them up. A number of areas are a bit difficult to get to with the old system in place, so don’t be afraid to cut the soon-to-be discarded pipes to make getting at bolt faces easier. Make sure the old exhaust is supported as you unbolt it to keep it from torquing the heat exchangers or anything else it may be attached to., Are they in good condition with no dents, major rust or other serious defects? If they are, then go ahead with the installation. But if your boxes are damaged, then replace them with a model that is compatible with replacement stock exhausts and use that exhaust configuration instead., Make sure they are smooth and flat. Crud can build up on the heater box side, especially if there were exhaust leaks through the old gaskets. Also, hold the replacement system in place to make sure the flanges are at least close to meeting up. A quarter inch offset is fine, but some of the kits being mass produced are coming out with flanges that are not even close. These need to be sent back. For minor defects in the mating surfaces of the flanges, either smooth them out yourself or take them to a machine shop and have them do it. Smooth surfaces are essential to preventing exhaust leaks.,, Don’t worry if they don’t meet exactly. If they come up short, take two garden shovels, placed the handles in the new exhaust system intake pipes and pry outward to make up some of the difference. They may still not align exactly, but should be close enough that you can place a big screwdriver through the exhaust flange, gasket and heat exchanger flange bolt hole and use it to gently leverage everything into place long enough to get the first bolt on that side. Then add the rest of the bolts through the flanges on both sides, hand tightening each., Now tighten the bolts the rest of the way down. The new exhaust should be secure to the heat exchangers. Now, tighten up any bolts for the hangers. Some of these are designed to allow some movement in the system, so don’t over-tighten any of those., Visually inspect the installation and wiggle the new exhaust to make sure it is not loose from the heat exchangers anywhere. With the van in neutral, the parking brake on and the wheels blocked, crank the engine and let run for a few minutes. Before the engine gets too hot, feel around where the flanges meet. If you have any leaks, you should be able to feel the exhaust blowing through them. Bolts may need to be tightened up at the flanges to compress the gaskets right. If that does not work, take the new system off and make sure again that the gaskets and mating surfaces are aligned right and smooth, with no defects. Again, sometimes you might have to use two gaskets to get a good seal with aftermarket exhaust systems., Exhaust systems heat and cool, plus they vibrate. This can loosen bolts and fasteners. It is a good idea to check that everything stays tight. After a week, it is a good idea to go over most areas like this every month or so to make sure nothing has come loose. It also does not hurt to keep an ear on your motor. Given the distinctive sound of the VW air-cooled engine, it’s usually easy to ear if you have even a relatively minor exhaust leak.	Consider what kind of exhaust you have. , Inspect the existing system. Place cardboard under rear of vehicle where you will be working. Remove the old system. Now that the old system is gone, take a good look at your heater boxes. Look at the flange surfaces for the heater boxes and the new exhaust system.While supporting the new exhaust in place, on the end opposite the tail pipe, put the first bolt, with washers, etc, through the exhaust flange, gasket – or two if necessary – and through the heater box flange and hand tighten. On the opposite end of the system, behind the tail pipe, try to get the holes to line up. Tighten everything up. Check your work. Reinspect everything a day later and then a week later.
You can’t know if you’ve got a talent for guitar if you never try to play guitar. Ditto didgeridoo, knitting, badminton, and Tuvan throat singing. Find a talent that seems cool and learn everything you can about it. Find out what it takes and see what you've got. If you never try, you'll never know. You’re not going to find a talent without trying. You can only find your natural abilities, skills, and talents when you test your mettle and actively seek new experiences. Face down obstacles and seek out challenges to see what innate skills and abilities you might be hiding.   Make it your goal to try something new every week. You might not discover something that you're super-talented at, but maybe you pick up a guitar one day and find out it feels comfortable in your hands and decide to learn more. Maybe you discover an ability to connect with animals at the shelter, something you'd never experienced before. Maybe you learn you're an ace at the Star Trek: The Next Generation pinball machine at the laundromat. That's the start of talent.Get outside and scrape your knees. Go on adventures and experience the world in its natural habitat. Try out different sports, outdoor hobbies like fishing, hiking, and climbing to see if you've got an untapped natural ability or an instinct for it.; , What comes naturally to you? What do you do without thinking? What do you love? Look to your obsessions and your interests for the possibility of talent. If you love to spend all day doodling, reading, or dancing, there's no point in wasting time wishing you had a talent for baking. Focus on the talents you do have by focusing on what comes easiest to you.   If you're in school, what homework comes most easily to you? What worries you the least? That might clue you in to natural talents. Pay attention to what other people might have noted about you. It’s common that others might have a keener sense of what you're good at than you will yourself. Ask your family, your friends, and your teachers to help you figure out what you make look easy.  Does the stage frighten you, or maybe public speaking? Writing a story and finishing it? Grab the mic and put pen to paper. Do what scares you. What would be your bucket list talent? What would you love to be naturally good at, without trying? Face down big challenges and find out what it takes to be good at them.   Start learning everything you can about different talents and skills to demystify the process. Shredding an electric guitar like Hendrix might look impossible, but if you don’t know a G chord from a flatpick, you don’t really have any clue how hard it is. James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader and noted Shakespearean actor with a booming, godlike voice, suffered from terrible stuttering as a child. He was terrified of speaking in class and only learned to speak properly by facing his fear. Now, he’s widely recognized as one of the most talented voice actors in the world.  What are other people tired of hearing you talk about? What do you have to drag yourself away from? Use the things you're obsessed with to discover abilities and talents that might be hiding under the surface.   Even if you’re obsessed with something that’s hard to connect to a talent, like watching television or movies, give yourself some credit. Maybe you have a talent for telling stories, or analyzing narratives. Maybe you have a talent for appreciating camera angles. Every film critic gets a start in the exact same way. Channel that obsession into learning about film history and learning how movies are made.  If you're feeling talentless, maybe it's because you've been missing out on your own successes. Try to pay close attention to successes, both little and big, to identify things for which you might have a natural talent. Think creatively about how these little successes might connect to more significant talents and abilities.   Maybe you've just thrown a killer party. Might not sound like a talent, but if you've got the people skills, the planning, and the organization abilities necessary to pull it off, celebrate that as a success. Maybe you have leadership talents and managerial skills that will prove useful down the road.  Shows like “American Idol” and "Britain's Got Talent" have very narrow definitions of what it means to be talented. If you’re not an attractive young person with a manufactured sob story and a loud, showy singing voice, these shows all lead people to believe they’re untalented. It’s not true. Being talented doesn’t mean being famous, being attractive, or being some kind of performer. It means dedication, creative thinking, and attention to detail. It means you have an insatiable curiosity to develop some innate abilities into skills. You've just got to find them.  Personality quizzes are often used in job-finding offices to try to figure out what you might have a natural ability for. It works the same way with talent. Learning more about your natural proclivities for and against certain ideas, attitudes, and behaviors can help you figure out more about your talents. These sorts of tests do not identify talents in and of themselves, but they can lend insights that might provide part of the puzzle.   Myers-Briggs is possibly the most famous of the personality quizzes, separating people into one of sixteen types of personalities based on answers to a variety of questions and research performed by Carl Jung.The Keirsey Temperament Sorter separates people into various temperaments, identified by your responses to a variety of scenarios and questions. It's available online.  One of the best ways to figure out what hidden talents you might have is to talk to the people who know you best. We tend to look over our skills and cover up our abilities, missing out too often on what makes us great. If you're lucky enough to have friends and family who care about you, they won't be so shy about pointing them out.  One way to think about talent is to think about some preternatural ability to do something, to make this thing look easy. Another way to think about it is to think about talent as the ability to overcome some obstacle. Was Blind Willie Johnson a more talented guitar player for having been blinded? Was James Earl Jones a better actor for having stuttered? Was Michael Jordan a better ball player for having been cut from the team?   Don't let perceived shortcomings or challenges keep you from trying new things and developing talent. Look at things that someone else might have identified as challenges in your personality or your ability. If you're a shy person, might it be all the more impressive if you were a great rock 'n roller singer? If you're especially short, might you be a great ball player?  , Some people think Hendrix was the best guitar player of all time, but he couldn’t have played a classic piece on guitar to save his life, because he couldn’t read music. He might have been able to, if he put his mind to it, but a classical musician might well look on Hendrix as a talentless hack. Don’t let other people tell you that being an excellent Razor scooter rider isn’t a “real” talent, or that making a really good grilled cheese doesn’t count.  Ryan Leaf was going to be the next big thing. A great football quarterback, finalist for the Heisman, second-overall pick in the NFL draft. Fast forward a few years, and Leaf is considered one of the biggest busts of all time, having failed to achieve at a high level. Natural talent for playing football doesn't mean anything if you don't commit to building it into a skill.   When you find your talent, think of it like a seed that you're planting. You're off to a good start, but you've still got to water it, mulch it, and weed around the edges to make sure your seed grows into a big plant. It takes work.  As iron sharpens iron, so one talented person sharpens another. If you've got a talent for something, or even if you just hope to develop talent in some field, surround yourself with other talented people and model yourself after their behaviors, practice routines, and attitudes about their talent. Learn everything you can from talented people.    Find a mentor who's willing to show you the ropes and coach you in developing your new skills. Blossoming guitar players need good teachers beyond YouTube. Blossoming singers need other people to play music with.  Developing your talent into a skill and your skill into an ability is going to be hard. The more you learn about a subject, a task, or an ability, the more complicated it becomes. Commit to learning everything you can about your field and challenging yourself to become a master. Turn your talent into something special. Make your talent real.   Playing chess might not get easier for Magnus Carlsen, just because he’s a phenomenal player. Now he knows just how complicated the game can be. The more you learn about a game, a skill, or a field, the more there will be to learn. It never gets easy.  Even if you've got no talent for the guitar, practicing two hours a day guarantees that you'll get a lot better. Someone who practices, whether it be sport, art, or any other field, will always end up more talented than someone who never picks up their instrument, picks up their paintbrush, someone who never practices. Hard work outruns ability every time.	Stop waiting for talents to appear. Try things that are easy. Try things that are hard. Follow your obsessions. Keep track of little successes. Ignore the television. Take a personality quiz. Talk to your friends and family. Look at both your strengths and your weaknesses for talent possibilities. Define talent for yourself. Commit to building your talent into a skill. Find other talented people. Respect the complexity of your talent. Practice.
The ribbon chosen should be at least the width of the watchband that you're replacing. Depending on the strength of the ribbon, it may need to be slightly bigger or folded double to give more strength.; , You will also need to account for some additional length that will let you tie the ribbon in a bow.   Once measured, cut the length. Have spare ribbon in case you make a measurement mistake. , This will prevent the ribbon from fraying at the ends.  It's recommended that you make a small double knot to ensure that the watch stays in place. You may need to make readjustments during the day.	Select a suitable piece of ribbon. Measure the ribbon against each watchband end to end. Thread the ribbon through each of the watchband bars on either side of the watch face.  , Finish off the ends of the ribbon by cutting a V shape. Tie around your wrist to keep it in place. Finished.
It’s very important that you not rub, scrub or scrape too hard or you might scratch the car exterior. However, you should still do some prepping of the car.   Pull as much of the gum off as you can before applying any products to it.Move the car into a shaded area so that the gum doesn’t melt while you’re working on it.; , It might be a good idea to wipe the area of the car where the gum is stuck to remove any obvious dirt.   All you need is a bucket full of hot water and dish soap. You just need a squirt of dish soap in two cups of water. Dip a cloth into the bucket, and wet it. Then, gently wipe away any easily removable residue from the car’s exterior.You want to avoid using anything too abrasive. It’s best to use a soft cloth when rubbing on a car exterior. You will want to repeat this process after you remove the gum too to get rid of any lingering residue. After removing the gum, you may need to apply a new coat of protective wax. If the water is hot enough, it may be possible to remove the gum using only soap and water.  Take a cotton ball, soak it in body solvent, and let it sit on the gum for about a minute to soften it up. Then, take a soft cloth with body solvent on it. Wipe it off.   You may need to repeat the process a second time if it doesn’t all come off.Body solvents are specifically designed to be used on paint, so they are a good choice for cleaning a car exterior without damage. You can also try this with rubbing alcohol.  If you wet the gum with bug remover and tar remover, it should come right off the car. You might need to wax the car after you use this, though, as it can remove some of the wax.   The good thing about bug and tar remover is that it’s designed specifically not to harm a car exterior because people usually use it to get rid of bugs that have flown into the car’s outside or tar that’s ended up on the vehicle. You could also apply the bug and tar remover to the gum by using a soft cloth. Rub the remover into the gum, until it starts to come off.  Goo Gone is one product that is widely used to remove gum from car exteriors. Goof Off also has a product that can be used on car paint.Goo Gone advertises that its product is safe for use on a car exterior if you follow the instructions for hard surfaces.To use either product, apply the product and wait three to five minutes. Pull the gum off. Use a clean cloth to wipe off excess gum.Wear safety goggles and solvent-resistant gloves when working with chemicals.  Believe it or not, there is a product designed to remove gum. It’s often used by industrial cleaners, so look for it in such a store.   Spray the remover on the gum, and then remove the gum from the car. Some people also use WD-40 oil to remove gum, bugs, and other grime from a car exterior., Spraying compressed air on the gum ma harden it enough for you to remove the wad. This method is usually very effective.   You can find these cans in most hardware stores. Usually, people use compressed air to clean other things, such as removing residue caught inside a computer keyboard. However, they work on a car exterior too.  You might be able to peel the gum off the car exterior if you harden it. You can do this with ice cubes.   Take a small towel and wrap the ice cubes in it. Hold it on the gum for about five minutes. Once you remove it, the gum should be hard. Try to gently peel off the hard gum. You may need to repeat the process. You could also put the ice cube in a Ziploc bag. Wrapping it will keep it from dripping too much once it starts to melt.  The oil in the peanut butter can help remove the gum from your car. It’s not designed to clean your car, but some people still use it, and they say it can work.Smear the peanut butter on the gum. Let it sit for three minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp rag. Peanut butter causes the chewing gum to lose its stickiness, and it becomes easier to pick out. You could also try putting body oil on the gum with the same principle in mind. Some people have also tried using eucalyptus oil with some success.	Prepare your car before trying to remove the gum. Clean the spot around the gum. Try body solvent. Spray the gum with bug and tar remover. Purchase a commercial product designed to remove grime. Purchase gum remover. Try a can of compressed air. Use ice to harden the gum. Use peanut butter.
Fortunately, interior design inspiration is abundant. Pick up a few interior decorating magazines at the store and browse through some design blogs online. Bookmark, dog-ear, and save photos that appeal to you, whether they depict entire rooms or simply a single furnishing or piece of artwork.   Another source of inspiration is TV programming that focuses on interior design. The only drawback to this type of inspiration is that you cannot easily save photos drawn from it for later use.; , A great way to begin bridging the daunting gap between finding inspiring photos online and decorating your own home is by creating an inspiration notebook. Print appealing photos from design blogs and clip pictures out of magazines. Use paperclips or paste to secure these pictures into a notebook.  Redecorating your home entirely from scratch is not generally feasible. The first important step when accommodating your existing décor is deciding which pieces to keep. Keeping large, basic pieces like sofas and tables will save you money, and their appearance can be changed dramatically through the use of accessories like throw pillows.   Furniture and décor in neutral colors can be accommodated in nearly any design scheme. Even a drab beige sofa can be livened up with brightly colored pillows. When a major piece like a sofa is brightly colored itself, this tends to constrain your design possibilities more. Use your redecorating ambitions as an excuse to discard or give away any décor that you are tired of or don't like. Keeping too many of your old furnishings will hamper your ability to create a new space anyway.  Avoid buying whole rooms full of décor at once; if you decide you don't like it, you'll have a tedious returns process on your hands. Rather, look to your inspiration notebook for some of your favorite pieces or motifs. Search for similar pieces online or at home décor stores, and begin introducing them into your room. As you work, decide what does and doesn't suit your taste, and which pieces work with your existing elements.   During this process of introducing new décor, you'll need to decide on a clear direction in which to take your style. Is it traditional or modern, subdued or lively, matching or eclectic, casual or formal, sparse or cluttered? When purchasing new pieces, ask yourself not only if you like them by themselves, but also if they'll fit well into your design scheme. Work one room at a time. Note that each room of your home does not have to follow the same exact template; some rooms can be more formal than others or more sparsely decorated. However, you do want to consider some overarching theme that makes your entire home cohesive.  Home decorating is best seen as something dynamic and fluid rather than something static. Even when you've completed your decorating, keep an eye out for new pieces and patterns that can be swapped out for stale ones in your home. As your tastes change, let your design change with them.	Browse design blogs and magazines for inspiration. Create a notebook to store your inspiration ideas. Work your new design ideas around your existing décor. Introduce new pieces into your space gradually. Alter and improve your home décor as needed.
People often say "use it or lose it" about muscles, but the same can be applied towards the senses. The more you use your senses, the better you get! Learn how to describe smells. You might even want to keep an olfactory journal! For extra practice, have someone hold various things to your nose while you're blindfolded and see if you can identify the smells.          Next time you are drinking a cup of coffee take time to really breathe in the smell before you drink it. When you are about to bite into some strong cheese, be sure to smell it before eating it. If you regularly smell things before consuming them, you can help improve your sense of smell over time.; , As well as being more attentive to the smells you encounter in everyday life, you can go further and adopt a training regime for your sense of smell. Begin by simply choosing four smells that you are fond of, such as fresh coffee, banana, soap or shampoo, and blue cheese. Then each day take a minute to go through and smell each one individually to stimulate the receptors inside your nose. Try to repeat this four to six times every day.         There is evidence that visualizing smells can help to improve your sense of smell. Take a minute to imagine your favourite smells.When you are trying to identify a particular smell you may find it useful to smell with a shallow sniff rather than a long deep inhalation., Studies suggest that our sense of smell is sharper after exercise. The causative link is uncertain, but it has been reported that the sense of smell appears to be better after exercise.Exercising enough to work up a sweat at least once a week has been connected to a lower risk of the sense of smell diminishing as you get older.          This could be because exercise improves brain functions or because it contributes to better general health., If your sense of smell is impaired by obstructive disorders such as congestion or hay fever, allergies, sinus infection, or nasal polyps, it will be necessary to treat the underlying issue in order to improve your sense of smell. Talk to your doctor about nasal steroids, which may help clear your nostrils and help you breathe and smell better., Hyposmia (the medical term for an impaired sense of smell) is sometimes linked with a deficiency in the mineral zinc, and a deficiency of vitamin B12 in vegetarians.To boost your sense of smell, try eating zinc-rich foods, such as oysters, lentils, sunflower seeds, pecans and consider taking a multivitamin supplement that contains at least 7 mg of zinc each day.  The nerves that sense smell are directly connected to the emotional part of your brain, leaving your rationality out of the equation. Studies found, for example, that the smell of fast food wrappers, fresh bread or pastry increase the likelihood of road rage; peppermint and cinnamon improve concentration and decrease irritability in drivers; and lemon and coffee promote clear thinking and high concentration levels in general.	Pay more attention to what you already smell. Train your nose. Get plenty of exercise. Talk to your doctor about nasal sprays. Get more zinc and vitamin B12 in your diet. Note how certain smells make you feel.
Kite grip is the most common way to grip poi. If it feels comfortable to you once you learn the grip, you can stick with this grip or experiment with other grips.   Hold the strap of one poi between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. Hold it by the right end of the strap so that the strap is pointing to the left. With your left hand, twist the strap towards you by ninety degrees to form a loop. Put your left middle and ring fingers through the opening in the loop. Let the loop come all the way over the two fingers to right below the first knuckle. Run the leash between your left middle and ring ringers so that when your hand is facing upwards the leash falls down towards the floor. Repeat these steps with to get the other poi on your right hand. , This is a popular alternative grip. If it feels more comfortable than kite grip, use it.   Turn your left hand palm up. With your right hand, hold the loop of one poi open. Put your left hand index and ring fingers through the loop. Let the loop come all the way over the two fingers to right below the first knuckle. Your middle finger should not be in the loop; it should be out and resting on top of the loop. Looking down at your left hand, the loop should come over your index finger, under your middle finger, and over your ring finger. With your left palm facing up, the leash should fall straight down to the floor. , This is the first and easiest of the four basic poi modes. The goal is to get each poi spinning in simultaneous circles on either side of your body.   Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable. Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body. Spin both poi forward simultaneously using your arms, wrists, and hands to create momentum. To help visualize the motion, imagine that you are spinning two levers in a circle on either side of your body. The movement of the circles should be simultaneous, so that the movement of each poi perfectly mirrors the other. Once you’ve mastered same time mode with the poi traveling forwards (clockwise), use the same technique but reverse the motion so the circles are traveling backwards (counterclockwise). , This is the second of the four basic poi modes. The goal is get each poi spinning in successive circles on either side of your body.   Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable. Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body. Spin the right hand poi forward, making a circular motion. When the end of the right hand poi reaches the top arc of the circle, begin spinning the left hand poi in another circle. This will look and feel much different than same time mode. With split time mode, you are creating successive circles, so that when the end of one poi is at 180 degrees, the end of the other poi should be at 0. Once you’ve mastered split time mode with the poi traveling forwards (clockwise), use the same technique but reverse the motion so the circles are traveling backwards (counterclockwise). , This is the third of the four basic poi modes. The goal is have one one poi traveling in a forwards (clockwise) circular motion while the other travels in a backwards (counterclockwise) circular motion, with the ends of both poi passing each other at 0 degrees and 180 degrees.   Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable. Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body. Spin the right poi forwards like you did with same time mode. At the same time, spin the left poi backwards. You should be making two large circles, with the ends of each poi traveling in opposite directions and passing each other at the top and bottom of the circles. Once you’ve mastered the motion, reverse the motion, using the same technique so that the right poi is spinning backwards while the left poi is spinning forwards., This is the fourth of the four basic poi modes. The goal is have one one poi traveling in a forwards (clockwise) circular motion while the other travels in a backwards (counterclockwise) circular motion, with the ends of both poi passing each other at 90 degrees and 270 degrees.   Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable. Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body. Spin the right poi forwards, making a circular motion. When the end of the right hand poi reaches 90 degrees, being spinning the left poi backwards in a circular motion. This will look and feel differently than split time mode. With split time opposites mode, the ends of the poi will be traveling in opposite directions and passing each other at 90 and 270 degrees. Once you’ve mastered the motion, reverse the motion, using the same technique so that the right poi is spinning backwards while the left poi is spinning forwards., Nearly all intermediate and advanced poi moves derive from the four basic modes. As you practice the modes and mix them together you’ll naturally start finding interesting ways to dance with your poi.  More advanced poi moves will be difficult to learn from words alone. Seek out online videos or a local fire dancer to help you learn more difficult moves.  You’ll need kevlar poi for this step. You’ll also need kerosene.   Pour the kerosene into a bowl or other container. One measuring cup of kerosene should be more than enough. Slowly dip the kevlar wicks of your poi into the kerosene, one by one. Let the excess kerosene drip back into the bowl. Once the kevlar is soaked but not dripping, carefully light the ends on fire with a match or lighter. Spinning with your fire poi will feel strange at first since the flame creates additional resistance.	Practice kite grip. Practice three-finger over-and-under grip. Practice same time mode. Practice split time mode. Practice opposites mode. Practice split-time opposites mode. Experiment with switching between the four basic poi moves and connecting them in creative ways. Learn intermediate and advanced poi moves. Light your poi on fire when you are fully comfortable with the moves.
International agreements and national regulations limit airline liability for the contents of lost or stolen luggage significantly. Even insurance policies typically have limits and won't cover expensive items.You also need to avoid packing items in checked baggage that is unique or untraceable. Examples include signed contracts and cash. If at all possible, arrange to carry electronic devices such as laptops or tablets in your carry-on luggage. The same goes for expensive cameras and camera equipment. Most airlines accept no liability for loss of these types of items, and list them explicitly as exclusions. If you're going on a trip that requires you to bring along expensive equipment, you might want to check into having it shipped to your destination. You also want to avoid including jewelry, fragile items, and anything with sentimental value. Essentially, if you cannot afford to replace it or if it is one of a kind, don't pack it in your checked baggage. If you have expensive or irreplaceable souvenirs that you've picked up during your travel, consider having them shipped home rather than carrying them in your luggage. You may have to pay a little more for international shipping, but the items will be insured and handled by professionals.  Before you head to the airport, make a list of the items in your checked bags. You also can take a picture of your open suitcase on your smart phone so you'll have it with you.Make sure you keep your inventory list on your person. For example, you might keep it on your phone. An inventory list would be pointless if you packed it in the checked bag. Review the liability limits and keep them in mind when you're packing. If you have items that you know will push the value of the total contents of your bag over the top, consider packing them in a carry on if possible. If you have a particularly expensive or important item, such as a laptop or a camera, that you regularly take with you when you travel, you might want to take out a separate insurance policy just for that item.  Closing your bag properly and securing the closures with a lock makes your bag less attractive to potential luggage thieves. Theft typically is a crime of convenience, and if your bag doesn't look easy to open most thieves won't bother.On the other hand, having a lock on your bag may signal to would-be thieves that your bag contains something valuable or worth stealing. When purchasing a lock (or luggage that comes with built-in locks) make sure it's approved by the air travel security agencies in the areas where you'll be traveling. If you use an unapproved lock, security agents may break it or the fasteners that close your bag while conducting a routine search. This would make your bag more vulnerable to theft than it was in the first place.  When purchasing new luggage, try to find something loud and colorful. Would-be thieves typically target plain black or navy blue bags that don't have any distinctive features. This makes it harder for you to identify your bag if you happen to catch them in the act.Another reason thieves often prefer nondescript bags is that, if stopped by security, it gives them the ability to pretend the whole thing was a mistake. They'll tell a security agent that they didn't intend to steal the bag, they just thought it was theirs because all these bags look alike. There's something to be said about choosing the gaudiest, loudest piece of luggage you can find. It's less likely to be stolen because nobody would want to be seen with it. In addition, you may be able to get it at a lower price, since stores often discount "ugly" bags that no one wants.  It takes awhile after you land for bags to start rolling through the carousel. If you don't dawdle in the airport, but proceed directly to baggage claim when you get off the plane, you may get their before your bag does.While most airlines provide claim tickets for checked baggage, these tickets are seldom checked and matched with the tag on a particular suitcase unless there's a blatant issue. Additionally, the baggage claim area typically is located very close to the airport exits, so travelers can easily leave once they get off their plane. This relatively insecure system makes it fairly easy for someone to simply walk up and take a bag off the carousel and head out the door before they are discovered. When you get to the baggage area, stand as close as you can to the opening where bags are placed on the carousel. If you have a bright bag that stands out, you should notice it immediately and be able to take it home before it's even exposed to a would-be thief.	Avoid packing valuable items in checked bags. Keep an inventory of the items you packed. Secure your bags with approved locks. Choose luggage that stands out. Get to baggage claim quickly.
Bamboo culms, or stalks, are connected underground by rhizomes that grow quickly and close to the surface of the ground. By cutting through the rhizomes, you can separate and contain bamboo. The easiest method for cutting through rhizomes is to slice them using the tip of a heavy shovel.   If you want to get rid of an entire grove of bamboo, you'll want to work from the outer edges inward. Separate the outer ring of bamboo first so that the bamboo gets contained in one area. Depending on how large a grove you're working with, this may take weeks, months or even years. This technique is also effective if you want to preserve a section of bamboo. Cut through the rhizomes that connect sections of bamboo so that they will no longer spread and continue growing together. Continue with the process of killing one section while allowing the other to live. You'll need to periodically cut back the remaining section to keep it from "running" underground and spreading to other areas.; , Now that the rhizomes are cut, shear back the culms as close to the ground as possible. For thin stalks, you may be able to use a lawnmower or a lopper. For larger ones, you might have to break out a chainsaw. If you keep the area maintained over time, the bamboo won't have the chance to get quite so large again.   You can cut the culms at any time of year, but doing it in the spring when you see new growth is a good time to get rid of bamboo. The bamboo is using its energy stores, and you'll be able to get rid of more of it more quickly than if you attempt to get rid of it while it's dormant.  Use a shovel to dig out the rhizomes and discard them. It's best to dig out the rhizomes the same day you cut down the culms; bamboo grows so quickly that waiting even a day or two will mean having new culms to cut down before you can get to work on the rhizomes.   If the grove is too big to mow and dig all in one day, remember to work from the outer edges inward, gradually containing the grove as you work to get rid of it.  You'll certainly miss some rhizomes the first few times around, so you'll need to use the same method several more times before the bamboo is completely gone. If you're working in the spring, the growth cycle will happen quickly, and you'll be able to get rid of a substantial amount of bamboo in a few days' time. During other times of year you may need to check the area for new growth every few weeks.  If your neighbor's bamboo continually creeps into your yard, you can keep it contained by installing a root barrier in the affected area. Rolls of plastic root barrier are available in home and garden stores. Metal and concrete barriers are also effective.You can dig a trench that will act as a barrier if you'd prefer not to use a non-porous material in your yard. Installing a pond or stream will also effectively block bamboo roots.  However, this doesn't always work as well as removing culms and rhizomes by hand. It might be tricky to find a chemical that works for the particular species of bamboo you're dealing with. Even if you do find one that works, you could end up killing other plants or wrecking your neighbor's treasured bamboo grove in the process.   If you want to try an herbicide, use a glyphosate herbicide or a selective-grass herbicide directly on new bamboo growth each time it appears. A selective-grass herbicide is not as effective as the glyphosate type in controlling bamboo, but it may be used in flower beds or around ornamental shrubs.  Not all bamboo species "run" all over the yard; some actually stay contained when you plant them. Ask an expert at your local nursery to help you choose a species that won't take over your property.  This is a simple way to enjoy bamboo while making sure it doesn't get out of control. Most bamboo species do well in large containers that may be placed on your porch or in your yard.	Separate the bamboo you wish to kill. Mow down the culms. Dig out the rhizomes. Keep mowing and digging until you don't see more shoots. Use a root barrier. Consider using herbicides.Applying an herbicide to the leaves of bamboo shoots may help to prevent new growth from occurring. Buy a clumping bamboo species. Plant bamboo in a container.
Silver plating is much too expensive for a beginning instrument.; , If you have been playing for 2 or 3 years on the same horn and have improved then, yes, you may be ready for a new trumpet, especially if your instrument is a basic or student trumpet. If you haven't been playing for that long, and there is very little need for you to purchase a new trumpet, hold off for a little while.  An intermediate trumpet will usually have more resistance in the upper register to prevent the player from over-blowing and ruining his/her chops. A professional instrument, depending on the model, will have little to no resistance, but will cost you a good bit more.  If your sound is really bright and brassy, then you may want to purchase a cornet, a large bore trumpet, or a Ring Mute. These two offer a darker sound. However, if you manage to produce a darker sound, which is hard to do without practice, you might want to start out on a small bore Yamaha, or a King.  Trumpets are expensive- the most expensive ones can easily run into five digits. Most step-up trumpets, though, are around one or two thousand dollars. That it still a lot of money, so be sure you can afford a new trumpet. If you can't afford the two thousand, but desperately need another trumpet, try looking for a used horn for sale. Many trumpet players, upon buying a new horn, no longer want or need their old one, and will sell it for a large discount with very minor wear.  Learn about what particular types of trumpet are considered better by the trumpet-playing community. Many Kings, for example, are considered next to useless, although they may catch your eye for having large designs of roses etched into the bell. The Bach Stradivarius, meanwhile, looks rather bland, but is considered a very good quality horn for its cost. (A bit over two thousand in most cases.)  , Go to the local music store, and not-so-local ones, and test all the trumpets they have. You don't want to make a bad decision, so give yourself as many options as possible. Test as many trumpets as possible. You should be able to test trumpets before you buy them at your local credible music shop. If you're not allowed to, don't give them your business. You might want to get a reliable worker at the store to help you out. Decide which horn has the least pressure and resistance when you play in the upper register.	Start off with a decent beginner trumpet from a reputable brand, preferably made of brass with a lacquer finish. Decide if you're ready for a new trumpet. Determine what level of trumpet to buy. Play with your sound a bit. Check your budget. Do research. Test trumpets.
Slide bar poster frames can be disassembled from the front or back of the frame, but either way, you need to work carefully to avoid damaging the plexiglass front.; , Pinch the top bar between your fingers and pull it straight out. Repeat with the bottom bar, as well.   These slide bars are usually made from plastic and only held on by pressure. As such, you should be able to pull them off the sides of the frame without the use of additional tools.  Grab one of the side bars with your fingertips and slide it along the edge of the frame until it completely comes off. When finished, repeat this step with the other side bar, too.   You may also be able to pull these two side bars off the frame in the same way you pulled off the top and bottom bars. Since the side bars are usually longer than the top and bottom ones, however, it might be easiest to slide them off instead of pulling them off.  Once the slide bars are gone, only the cardboard backing and plexiglass front should remain. You should be able to simply lift one away from the other to finish taking apart the frame.   Note that if there's a picture inside the frame, you can remove it after separating the backing and plexiglass.	Work from either side. Pull away the top and bottom bars. Slide the side bars off. Separate the backing and the plexiglass.
Also, make sure your bow isn't leaning in either direction, but is perpendicular to the strings.; , Your elbow should be approximately the same height as your shoulder when the bow is placed on the A or D string(this may differ on how you hold your violin and what style of teaching you use, most students that use the Suzuki method of teaching are sometimes told to put a book under their shoulder to use more wrist and less arm, however this can result in not using a full bow on louder notes resulting in poor projection which can make one press too hard on the bow causing it to give a scratchy sound.) Sometimes it is helpful to lean your shoulder against a doorpost so that it cannot move.    PP =Pianissimo. Put on enough pressure to not make a wispy sound but light enough so that the audience (or you) can hear it clearly, and softly. P = Piano. Use a bit more pressure but not so much that it sounds like F. It should show contrast from PP so that they don't sound exactly the same, but not too loud. It should be a little bit less pressure than MF. MP = Mezzopiano. Medium soft, a mix between P&MF. Many violinists make the mistake of thinking that MP is quieter than P, but it is actually louder. The Mezzos (MP&MF) are difficult to analyze, because they are the most unique dynamic and are used to show small contrast. MF = Mezzoforte. Medium loud, give it a light, airy sound that does not hold too long, and then crescendos or diminuendos(decrescendos) in a piano sound. F = Forte. Loud, try to use your full bow if the passage you are playing allows you to. It will give it a full sound. The sound of Forte. FF =Fortissimo Very loud; don't hesitate to play the loudest sound your instrument can produce! And yes, there are FFF(fortonoando)& FFFF(sometimes referred to blastissimo), but you do not see them often. FF is extremely loud. Considered the opposite of PP, use a lot of pressure for this loud dynamic. Also, increase speed of your bow.    Trills- Make sure to have plenty of bow to give it a full sound, and make sure it resonates. Try to trill fairly fast also. Slurs- A slur is more than one note played in the same bow stroke. String crossings are sometimes difficult when you slur, so it's recommended that you let you bow flow to the the next string. Do not jerk your hand/arm; it will hit the other string too early, or you won't leave the other string in time. Staccato - Very quick, short notes. Jerk your hand, not your arm. Think of it as a "bouncing a ball" motion. Spiccato - Spiccato is done near the frog of the bow (on the balancing point), never near the tip as this is very difficult. Allow your bow to leave your string. Spiccato is like many fast lifts, so remember, move your arm a concave curve. You have to use your fingers to propel the bow to move. Always bounce the bow near the string, lest you get a short, scratchy sound. Try to make the sound lush and longer. Spiccato requires lots of practice and listen to how your teacher describes doing it. Play a full bow, but there are times when one may have to play at the frog for a strong sound, or play at the tip for a soft sound. Be very particular with the section of the bow and the speed at which you are playing.	Know that it is essential that you keep your bow straight, about halfway between the bridge and the end of the fingerboard. Bowing should be done with the elbow and the wrist; the shoulder should not move much at all. Mind the pressure you place on your violin strings. Now, articulations.
When you are on a slope, you need to come to a complete stop using either the brake pedal or the handbrake. This holds true whether you’re facing up a slope or down a slope.  Some drivers prefer to use the handbrake, because it frees up their right foot to use on the gas pedal when they intend to start driving again.; , Many manual cars have hill start assist, which will help keep your car from rolling backward when you are stopped on a hill. It will also help when you try to start from a complete stop as well. If you have hill-start assist in your car, it will automatically work so you do not have to press any buttons.Hill-start sensors in the car automatically detect when your vehicle is on an incline. The hill start assist maintains pressure on the brake pedal for a set period of time to help you while you’re moving your foot from the brakes to the gas pedal. Hill-start assist does not increase your traction, so if you are in inclement weather or the road is slippery, you may still start to roll backwards.  When it is time for you to begin moving again, shift into first gear and step on the accelerator pedal.          Continue pressing on the accelerator until the engine spins at about 3000 RPM.  At this point, you’ll feel the front of the car lift slightly since the clutch is taking on the weight of the car., Gradually release the handbrake as you lift the clutch slightly.As the handbrake disengages and releases, the car should begin to move forward.  When you hear the sounds of the engine start to fade, continue applying more and more throttle. Now, you’re able to start driving up the hill again without rolling backwards.  Make sure to release the clutch until it is fully engaged.  If your handbrake doesn't work, use the heel of your right foot to hold down the brake pedal while you use your toes to work the accelerator. You will release the brake pedal instead of the handbrake as you’re releasing the clutch.          If your handbrake doesn’t work, take your car to a mechanic and have it fixed. Relying on the transmission to hold the car causes wear and tear and can have adverse effects on your engine.	Come to a complete stop. Use hill-start assist, if available. Shift into first gear. Lift the clutch to its biting point. Slowly release the handbrake. Slowly release the clutch, listening to the engine. Hold the brake pedal, if no handbrake.
Frost can be a major danger for young olive oil trees. In general, opt to plant in spring after temperatures have been consistently warm and there has been no recent frost. Most people plant trees during April or May, but adjust for your region.The more time trees have to grow before winter, the better. Plant your trees as soon as possible after the last expected frost date of the season.  Purchase potted olive trees online or at a local greenhouse. Seeds on their own are fragile and difficult to cultivate. You should plant trees that are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) high and whose branches start at three feet., Measure the trees pot, including its circumference and height. Dig a hole about that deep and wide. You do not have to get the hole the exact number of inches and measure, but the hole should be roughly the same size so that the tree fits comfortably in the soil., Remove the tree from the container, including all the roots. Cut or untwist any circling roots as best you can, but stay away from the root ball. Cutting into this can damage your plants., Use the previously dug soil and surrounding soil to fill in the rest of the hole. Put an inch of topsoil over the root ball. At this time, things like fertilizer and compost should not be added near your tree. The tree should grow out of the native soil initially., Dip emitters are irrigation systems that keep your olive trees properly hydrated. For the first year, they should be placed right next to each tree trunk. The following year, they should be moved 24 inches away from the trunks. A second emitter should be added, also 24 inches away from the trunk.Installing dip emitter is complicated. While you can purchase them at a hardware store, installation is tricky unless you have extensive gardening experience. It is best to hire professionals to install your emitters. Usually, emitters are hooked up to a water source such as an outside faucet. You then run the tubing across your garden or yard until it gets to the base of your trees. You will then poke holes in the tubing and install a watering device to help irrigate your olive trees., When using dip irrigators, you should water your trees Other mulches can be used instead of coarse straw. Lucerne, soya bean, and pea hay, to name a few, are excellent mulches high in nitrogen and other nutrients to feed the tree.	Plant your trees in the spring. Start with potted trees. Dig a hole about the same size as the tree's planting container. Take the tree out of its container and check the roots. Fill the hole. Install dip emitters near the tree trunk. Water and mulch the area with straw.
In a circle, rotate your shoulders forward, up, and then back. Keep your shoulders in the back position. Relax them so that they are slanted down., When your shoulders are slightly back, you will find that your chest naturally rises. Holding your chest high will create more room for your diaphragm to expand. Do not strain or puff out your chest., When you are breathing in, your core should be relaxed in order to expand to accommodate the air that you are taking into your body. Your core will tighten as you slowly release this air to project your voice.   Test your breath ability by placing your hand on your belly. Take a deep breath in. Focus on breathing into your hand by expanding your belly. Do not raise your shoulders when you breathe.  Your arms should be to each side of your body. Keep them relaxed and not rigid. Your hands should be slightly away from your body. Remember to also relax your hands and your fingers.Wiggle your fingers and wrists when you feel like you are too stiff.	Rotate your shoulders to the back and down. Hold your chest high. Tighten and relax your core. Place your arms by your sides.
Although you can buy special strawberry pots that have multiple openings, it isn’t absolutely necessary; strawberries can grow and produce fruit in any container that has good soil and gets enough sunlight.   Place broken terracotta or ceramics at the base of the container, or large pebbles/small rocks. These will help ensure good drainage.  The strawberry pot should have at least an 18” diameter. Even though strawberries have shallow roots, they do produce runners that need some space to extend.   Strawberries thrive in soil that has a pH between 5.3 and 6.5, so select a potting soil with that ratio. It’s a good idea to keep your soil rich by adding a handful of compost to the container once a month. If growing in a tall and narrow unglazed strawberry jar, add a quarter peat moss before adding the soil, to increase the moisture-retaining ability of the jar. If growing in a hanging basket, line the basket with sphagnum moss and use peaty soil. Again, this is to retain moisture for the plants. Sphagnum moss will also allow for the plant to grow out the sides of the pot, which looks nice.  Then make 5 or 6 mounds of soil about 1” (25.4 mm) tall. Space the mounds at least 6” (152.4 mm) apart so that the runners will have room to roam. The mounds themselves shouldn’t be more than 3” (76.2 mm) wide.  If necessary, cut the pot with scissors if the plant is wedged in too tightly. Carefully shake off the extra soil while separating the delicate roots with your fingers.  Soak the strawberry roots for an hour, so they can absorb enough to keep them hydrated.  Arrange the roots so that they extend down the sides of the mounds.  The stems emerge from the crown, so don’t bury it under the soil.  Continue to gently water until the pot begins to drain. (Add more soil if necessary—the thorough watering will often collapse air pockets and reduce the soil level.)   Use a watering can with a sprinkler attachment to avoid eroding the soil.  The container can now be placed outside (hanging or sitting on the ground), or in a warm and sunny spot inside.  Wait for a few to accumulate or simply eat them as they ripen. How many you'll get per harvest will depend on the amount you've grown and the container's size.	Choose a potting container with drainage holes. Fill the pot two-thirds full with potting mix. Water the soil until the water starts to drain from the bottom of the pot. Gently lift your strawberry plants from their nursery pots. Fill a bucket or other container with water. Remove the plants from the soaking water and set a plant on top of each soil mound. Fill the pot with more soil, bringing the soil to the level of the plant’s crown. Water the plants thoroughly. Done. Harvest when ready.
Make sure that you understand the timing and play the proper note lengths.  Imagine a snails pace. The slower, the more time you have to read, find the notes and finger them for the sound as desired.  Practicing them wrongly will make you build a habit of using the wrong notes as if they're the right ones! The same goes for fingering the melody and chords correctly.   If you have a teacher, let him or her play it for you. Clapping the notes is also a good way to get a feel for the time and rhythm of the song!	Try to calculate the beats per minute and use a metronome to set that pace, but you do not really need one. Alternatively, try playing extra slowly. Make sure that you play the notes right!
As the production of this vehicle was ended in the early 90s, you are looking at a car which is at least two decades old that Jeep dealers no longer stock parts for and haven't in over a decade.   Grand Wagoneers are classics, and are neat to look at, and fun to drive, but they never had the greatest reputation for reliability even back when they were new. They also get terrible gas mileage because they were built in an era when gas prices were measured in cents per gallon rather than dollars. Expect around 11 mpg city 13 highway.; , In contrast, individuals who have a special bond with this particular model will typically be "gentler" with the vehicle, and will not require it to perform vigorously. This makes the restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer a viable choice for these customers.    Talk to Jeep retailers, mechanics, and restorers. Educate them about your desire to purchase a restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer. Chances are high that one of these individuals should be able to point you in the proper direction. In addition, individuals who are exhibiting their vehicles at classic car shows and members of Jeep car clubs may be able to provide you with the name and contact information of someone who is interested in selling their restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer. You may also want to consult online discussion boards for possible leads. A number of websites, including www.wagonmaster.com, contain listings of restored Jeep Grand Wagoneers for sale. , A major area of concern is where the gas tank skid plate attaches to the frame. If you see rust on the skid plate or the frame don't walk, RUN!  ,, areas to check are the rocker panels (under the doors) and directly in front of and behind the rear wheels. If the magnet doesn't stick the truck had rust spots that has had a cheap repair with bondo, the rust WILL be back! The correct way repair rust is to cut out the whole rusted body panel out and weld in a new one.  These vehicles are known for water leaks and if the carpet has stayed wet for any length of time, the floorboards will likely be rusted out. ,, If there is any oil in the air cleaner the engine has blow by and will need an overhaul soon.   Once you have identified a possible option, you should evaluate both its physical appearance and function capabilities. Take any vehicles you are considering for a test drive before committing to a purchase.    If a certain vehicle meets your approval, make an offer to the seller. Be prepared to pay a large sum of money for a completely restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer. Some estimates suggest that these vehicles can sell for as much as 20 to 35 thousand dollars for an all original Grand Wagoneer with very low miles. Good driver quality Grand Wagoneers with over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) usually run from 2 to 8 thousand dollars..	Before buying a restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer, it is important to determine if it is really right for you. Those who are looking for a SUV which can take a beating for several years may want to consider a newer model. Find a possible vehicle. Evaluate possible restored vehicles, some restorations are better than others.  , Check for rust, these vehicles are known for having rust problems which is one reason they have become rare in some parts of the country. Fresh paint on the frame directly under the driver's door is a sign that someone was trying to cover up a rust problem.  , Check the body with a magnet. Take the screws out of the door trim strips that hold the carpet down and pull the carpet back. Most of these vehicles will have been repainted because the factory paint was defective, not a deal breaker but check for the quality of the finish.  , Check under the vehicle for oil leaks, the front and rear engine seals, transmission, and transfer case are problem areas on these vehicles.  , Take the top of of the air cleaner and look for oil. Purchase the vehicle.
Any type will do, but if you're starting as beginner, graph paper is best.  With a pencil, you can erase any mistakes.  Make sure you only draw on the line to make sure it's straight.  This is the bottom side of your box.  This is the top of the box. ,	Get blank sheet of paper. Get a pencil. Draw a rectangle or square using the boxes. Draw one line slanting upwards. Draw two lines on the top. Connect the remaining lines.  , Finished!
Use a can of white spray paint to mark off the areas, and observe them over a week to 10 days to make sure they are accurately marked.   You will need this information when choosing garden flowers so that taller flowers do not cut off the sun from the lower growing plants.; , Make a scale drawing of your garden, marking off the sections and indicating the sun density of each.  Check their space requirements and compare that with your scale drawing to see how many flowers you can fit in a plot.  It can be as simple as choosing 1 or more colors and staying in those color families, or you can plan out a color riot with small patches of every color imaginable scattered around.   One very pretty look is planting a color gradient by choosing 1 color, such as red. Plant the palest pink flowers in front and gradually darken the rows until you have deep red flowers, such as climbing roses, trained on trellises in the very back.  Every gardening catalog includes zone maps and appropriate growing zones for every plant they sell. , Try to have a good mixture of blooming dates to ensure color all season long.  Do you want a cutting garden to fill vases inside your home or maybe some lovely scented flowers to permeate the air? A cutting garden should have long stemmed flowers which will grow tall, so plan for that when plotting the flower garden. Scented flowers are nice beneath a window where their aroma can waft into your home.	Divide your garden area into sections according to the amount of sunlight they receive during the day. Measure your garden area, overall and individual sections. Browse your garden catalogs making notes of which flowers you are particularly attracted to and their light requirements. Choose a garden color theme. Learn the planting zone you live in and buy flowers rated for that zone. Group flowers according to their watering needs as much as possible.  , Consider blooming times when planning your garden. Consider flower use.
You can find them at any auto parts store such as NAPA, AutoZone, Checker, Kragen, etc., or big-box stores like WalMart, Costco, Target, and others.   The pencil types look like little metal tubes, and a ruler-like gauge pops out the top showing the air pressure. Dial gauges give you a very clear readout of your tire's pressure. Digital gauges give you a LCD readout that requires no interpretation.	Pick up a tire pressure gage.
Preferably a M.O.L.L.E pack or another good outdoor backpack that isn't brightly-colored. It needs to be earth tones.; , You should also pack some large triangle bandages and gauze pads. Add a bottle of Tylenol/Aspirin, some anti-diarrhea tablets, some sort of re-hydrating powder (Gatorade or the like), toothbrushes and toothpaste.  Have in your tool kit: wire cutters, 50 yards (45.7 m) of 550 parachute cord, a machete, wire, a small hammer, a collapsible shovel, screwdrivers, a fixed blade knife, ammunition, a sharpening stone, flint+steel, etc.  3 pairs of underwear, 7 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of pants (not blue jeans), army field jacket, combat boots, 3 web belts and 5 olive drab T-shirts, watch.

Provide enough water for everybody in the "party". Consider other optional items.
The circuit breaker is a metal box often located in your basement, hallway, or storage room.  Make sure the floor and your hands are dry before touching the circuit breaker panel. This will help you avoid electric shock.; ,  Do not touch or attempt to fix the circuit breaker yourself if you see bare wires or signs of burning upon opening the circuit breaker panel. Instead, skip to step #7 and contact a professional electrician for further assistance., If this resolves the problem and the breaker stays on, the circuit breaker is in good working condition.  Proceed with the following steps if the circuit breaker trips and returns to the “Off” position.  Most breakers are labeled accordingly, and will tell you which circuit is being controlled by the breaker. For example, a breaker labeled “kitchen” controls the circuits and electricity for all major appliances in your kitchen., This helps identify whether the problem is due to an overloaded circuit, which is when a circuit has more amps flowing through it than it can support. For example, if the circuit is for your living room, unplug all lamps, television components, computers, and any other appliances plugged into living room outlets.,, If the circuit breaker is in good working condition, you will hear a loud, definite “click.” If the switch trips immediately, emits a burning smell, or flops back and forth easily without clicking, it’s possible the circuit breaker is faulty.If the circuit breaker works for a few minutes or hours, then trips again later on, the circuit may be overloaded. If this happens, move electrical components from the faulty circuit to another circuit to distribute electricity more effectively.  A professional electrician will take the necessary precautions to fix the circuit breaker and any wiring problems in your home.	Open your circuit breaker panel. Identify whether any breaker switches have tripped and are in the “Off” position. Switch the breaker back to the “On” position. Identify the circuit for the breaker you suspect is bad. Unplug all electrical appliances connected to that particular circuit.Return to the circuit breaker panel. Flip the circuit breaker you suspect is going bad. Contact a professional electrician for help with repairing the faulty circuit breaker.

Dante has a white Jingshu.
Scrap canvas is a clever way of working on uneven fabric using a "temporary grid" formed by the scrap canvas. This can be a great way to add an embroidered design to something made of heavier fabric, such as a canvas backpack. This is done by selecting single weave canvas and basting it onto the uneven weave fabric.   Work the design following your pattern over both the scrap canvas and the uneven fabric. When you have finished embroidering the pattern onto the fabric, remove the basting from the scrap canvas. Carefully trim the scrap canvas away. Do not cut any cross stitches. Move from one corner first and carefully draw out the strands of scrap canvas in a single direction. Once all of these strands have been removed, move to the opposite corner and pull out all of the strands that run in the other direction. This requires delicate finger movements and small scissors, so if you don't feel as if you can do it without cutting the thread, either ask someone else more nimble to finish it off for you, or use a different method outlined here.; , You can purchase even-weave fabric from spools at craft stores and these can be purchased in any lengths desired. While still even-weave, these provide a different creative approach to your embroidery project by offering a very limited canvas space that can be applied to a very wide array of existing items, such as pillow cases, sheets, hairbands, towel edges, face washers, bibs, clothing, curtains, aprons, etc.  This might include shirts or jackets with an Evenweave pocket or sleeve edges already sewn in place but awaiting embroidering. Bibs are often done in this style when sold in craft stores.  Gingham is great for adding cross-stitch designs because it has squares in place as the natural formation of the fabric. Work the stitches using a chart, following the squares of the gingham as guidance. Naturally, smaller gingham squares are far easier as the size of the stitches will be determined by the size of the checks.	Consider using scrap canvas. Try decorative bands. Look for pre-manufactured items with Evenweave cloth already sewn in place awaiting stitching. Use gingham.
They can be installed to allow your bike to breathe better. It blocks dirt particles from reaching the motorcycle’s engine, improving its airflow and boosting its performance.  They are proven to improve the torque and horsepower of the motorcycle. It allows the bike to breathe more air out of the engine.

A regular old carper cleaner should do a good job here, or you can spring for heavy-duty if the smell is particularly bad. Then go through the mats and give them a good vacuum.   Even if you can't clean the mats at least vacuum them. This alone may help the smell. You're likely to remove small particles that have been thoroughly soaked with or cloaked by smoke, if not remove some of the smell itself.      ; , It goes without saying, but it needs to be said. After cleaning the ashtray out, spray some ordinary air freshener into it out rub around with an absorbent kitchen paper. This will leave a thin layer of the air freshener in the ashtray. The layer is not enough for the ashtray to be flammable but it is enough to have retain a pleasant scent.  Of course, if you're trying to hide the fact that you've been cleaning the car, or that the car needed cleaning in the first place, then hanging a loud car freshener is likely to attract some suspicion. But if you're just concerned with removing noxious odors from your vehicle, then hanging an air freshener or vent can make a big difference.  Unlock the doors, turn the engine on, and put your car's heat and air into recirculate while you clean the rest of the car. As you continue to clean the car and remove some of the smoky odors, the new, fresh air will recirculate throughout the entire cabin and improve the quality of air in your car.   If you really think your car needs it, consider replacing the cabin's air filter. Consider changing your car's air filters every 12,000–15,000 miles (19,000–24,000 km), or at least once a year. If you can't remember the last time you changed them or had them replaced, do yourself a favor and go for it. It should make a difference.  Fabric and upholstery cleaner, such as Scotchgard fabric and upholstery cleaner, does a pretty good job of neutralizing offending odors. Spray on seats, floor mats and even seat belts — pretty much anywhere there's exposed fabric. Following manufacturer's directions, scrub the cleaner into the fabric with a soft-bristled brush big enough to do the job.   You may want to consider getting an antibacterial one, as these can work better with smoke smells. Either way, this shouldn't be your last resort.       This may be less convenient, but removing your seats from the car before you clean them will have a drastic effect on removing the odor. There is a lot of carpet under seats that is difficult to reach but that still absorbs smoke smells. Removing the seats and then cleaning them will allow you to get at the hard-to-reach areas where the smoke odors may be hiding. This makes a huge difference., It may sound odd, but it really works. Pet odor eliminators, especially those used to remove urine stains and (most importantly) smells, can work wonders. Try out a product like Nature's Miracle for a miraculous finish.  Dryer sheets also work to keep a car smelling fresh. Just place several sheets or a small, opened box of dryer sheets someplace in the car, like under the car's four seats. When exposed to heat from the sun, the dryer sheets will release a fresh scent. A box of dryer sheets will freshen your car for a long time and could be less expensive than buying numerous car fresheners.   Dryer sheets will absorb unpleasant odors after a while. Not only this, but their ability to release pleasant odors will be somewhat diminished after time. Be sure to replace them every so often.  Use Lysol, for example, or very low concentration bleach water, for best results. Find the air intake (typically under the hood right close to the windshield) and, with the fan on in the car, spray with a water bottle. This will clean out some odor that's stagnated inside the ducts.  Apply the shampoo directly to the carpets and/or seats. Work the shampoo into the fabric with a brush or cloth (brush works best). Then vacuum up the remaining shampoo with an extractor, which you may be able to rent from an auto detailer or local supply store.  Baking soda is a natural deodorant that has so many uses it's almost criminal. Especially for cars with fabric interiors, this option works great. For heavy-duty smells, you'll need about a whole one-pound packet of sodium bicarbonate. Here's what you do:   Sprinkle the baking soda over as many porous surfaces as possible. These include the mats, seats, roof (try using a duster to fling the baking soda onto the carpeted roof), and wherever else the smell may have permeated.       Work the baking soda into whatever surface it's on. You can use a cloth, a brush, or even your hands to work the baking soda into the fabric.       Wait for at least 30 minutes, or up to a day. The longer you wait, the longer the baking soda's deodorizing properties get to work on your smelly ride.       After the allotted waiting time, vacuum up any remaining baking soda. Be sure to take at least two whole passes to remove any baking soda, along with particulates that may be causing the car to smell.  To make the mixture, combine 1/4 cup of vinegar (white not cider) with 2 cups of water. Pour into your sprayer and shake. Mist the windows and the cloth interior with the vinegar-water mixture before wiping any any excess. As it's applied, mixture may be redolent of vinegar, but the vinegar smell wears off quickly once it's dried.  If you don't like the smell of coffee, you may be out of luck on this one, although the tactic really does work. Place six paper plates strategically throughout the car; onto each plate, spoon one cup of roasted coffee, evenly spread out across the entire plate. Keeping the windows down about an eighth of an inch, allow the coffee smell to permeate the car on a warm, sunny day. After a day, remove the coffee beans and enjoy the smell of your latte... er, car!  , Although not a surefire way of removing bad smoke odors from your car, this method is reputed to work because newspaper is an odor absorbent. Crumple up a good number of old newspaper sheets and place them strategically throughout your cabin. Wait 48 hours for the newspaper to absorb all the smoke smells, and then remove the newspaper and recycle.   As much most of the methods detailed in this article, this method can work in combination with other methods. Use this method to increase your chances of removing odors while placing coffee beans in your car, for example, or when coating it with baking soda.  You can find activated charcoal at pet supply stores, health food stores, or even bigger department stores. Place a cup or so of activated charcoal, which comes in powder form, in a bowl, and then place that bowl in your car. Wait for a day or two, after which time the charcoal should have worked its magic and absorbed a lot of the smells of smoke from your car.   Some animal products have activated charcoal in them, at far less cost. Kitty litter, for example, may contain it. In the end — it might be cheaper — and just as effective to place a bowl of kitty litter in your car rather than buy a huge supply of activated charcoal and only use it once.Activated charcoal is a quite strong natural odor eliminator. If you've tried using baking soda and it's not eliminated the smell of smoke completely, try this method. It should neutralize the odor very well.  A cup or so will do the job. Ammonia is very harsh, so be sure not to bunk up in the car while the ammonia is work on eliminating the car's odors. After removing, open the windows and air out the car for an hour or two before using the car. Repeat this every night for a week or two if the odor isn't eliminated after a single use.  Instead of masking the odor, the ozone generator will completely remove it. The ozone actually oxidizes and denatures the residual organic compounds causing the odor.  Getting your car detailed by a professional will cost a little bit more money, but you won't have to worry about removing the smell yourself, and you rest assured that the car detailer is drawing on a wealth of experience and resources in order to get your car back to its cleanest, natural state.	Clean your mats with a carpet cleaner and vacuum them. Clean out the car's ashtray. Hang a car freshener or a vent clip in the cabin of the car. Put the car's heater and air into recirculate for 30 minutes. Go at it with fabric and upholstery cleaner. Go at your seats and carpeted area with a pet odor eliminator. Make use of dryer sheets. If the odor is still particularly pervasive, consider spraying a highly diluted cleaner through the heater ducts. Give your car's fabric a timely shampoo. Make use of baking soda. Wipe the interior of the car, including the glass, with vinegar and water. Try placing roasted coffee beans throughout the car for a day. Use crumpled up newspaper. Place activated charcoal in your car's interior to act as local filters. Try leaving a small amount of ammonia or vinegar in the car overnight. After the car has been cleaned, remove any residual odor with an ozone shock treatment using an ozone generator. Spend a little bit of money to have a professional worry about it.
If you have older pieces of furniture, such as furniture you got at a local thrift store, try painting it. A dull wooden chair can be painted a bright, pastel color to brighten up your apartment. The black legs on a dully colored couch can also be painted in bright colors.If you really want to get creative, try adding designs to furniture. You can apply a stencil to a chair or stool, for example.  If you can find affordable glass furniture, this can really brighten up a dully colored room. A glass coffee table, end table, or kitchen table can really add some light to your space. In addition to this, you'll be able to see the floor though the glass. This can make your space look less cluttered., In rental kitchens, your counters may be darker colored. This can make your whole kitchen look dull. Place decorate plates or trays on countertops. You can also try an attractive cutting board made of light colored wood., Be careful when arranging a rental space. Where you put your furniture can make a huge impact on lighting. Try to keep chairs, sofas, and other items of furniture away from windows.Experiment a little as you set out furniture. Tweak your set up quite a few times until you get the right look.	Paint old furniture in brighter shades. Go for glass furniture. Cover ugly countertops. Position furniture in a way that doesn't block out light.
In applicable situations, the first thing you should do for fires involving flammable liquids is to turn the fuel supply off.For instance, if a static discharge ignites gasoline around a fuel pump, the first thing you should do is hit the emergency shutoff valve located nearby at all pumping stations. This act severs the small fire from the very large fuel sources around it.   In many instances where the flammable liquid is the only fuel source, the fire may extinguish itself as soon as you cut the fuel supply.  You can also use a fire blanket on small Class B fires. If a fire blanket is readily available, this can be the easiest, least damaging method to extinguish it.   To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire. Ensure the fire is not too large for the blanket to smother it. Vegetable oil igniting in a frying pan, for instance, is a small enough fire for a fire blanket.  As with electrical fires, water-based (Class A) fire extinguishers should not be used on liquid or oil fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and dry chemical fire extinguishers will have a Class B rating.Check the label on the extinguisher and ensure that it says Class B before using it on a flammable liquid fire.   To use the extinguisher, pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle, point the horn at the base of the fire, and hold down the handle.As you see the flames shrinking, approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911. The only exception to this rule when the liquid fire stems from vegetable oil or animal fats in commercial-size deep fryers and other restaurant equipment. The large size and extreme heat and fuel source of these devices get their own classification for fire extinguishers—Class K extinguishers.Restaurants with this type of equipment are legally required to keep a Class K extinguisher present.Do NOT throw water on liquid or oil fires. Water does not mix with the oil. When they are together, the oil stays on top of the water. The water will then boil and become steam 'very quickly.’ This quick boil is dangerous. Since the water is on the bottom of the oil, it sprays hot, burning oil in every direction as it boils off and evaporates. This then spreads the fire very quickly.  Even if the fire is out, you should still call 911.Smoldering objects can reignite, and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely.	Shut off the fuel supply. Use a fire blanket to smother the fire. Use a Class B fire extinguisher. Call 911.

To improve the quality of your image, you can project it on a white screen. The easiest way to do this is to take blank white paper and tape it up at the end of the viewer (furthest from the hole). One sheet of paper is sufficient., In order for your viewer to capture the an image of the sun, you have to aim it. Avoid looking at the sun to aim the viewer. Instead, point the viewer in the general direction of the sun and then move it around slowly until you see the sun on your screen., Once you have the sun on your screen, it is safe to look at. You do not need any safety glasses or other special equipment. The image is much less intense than actually looking at the sun.	Tape up your screen. Aim the pinhole at the sun. View the sun.
Use a measuring tape to do this. Then mark these parameters on the floor using painter’s tape. You could also use yardsticks or other found objects to mark the parameters on the floor., If you do not have one large piece, then combine two or three medium sized pieces that complement each other. Place the large piece(s) slightly off-center, i.e., 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) off-center., Starting from the center and moving outward, place the smaller pieces of art around the larger, centered piece(s). Space the pieces at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, but not more than 7 inches (17.8 cm).Make sure to space out large pieces. Try pairing pieces together based on color, for example.  Lay out your pieces of art in at least three different arrangements. Take a picture of each arrangement. Then go back to compare and contrast the arrangements and pick your favorite one.	Measure the wall space you want to fill. Anchor the composition with one big piece. Fill in the space around the centered pieces. Experiment with different arrangements.
Different people have different personalities; some people read a lot and apply a little while some people read a little and apply all of it. Effectiveness lies in the balance. Balance says 'how much I can read and apply it immediately without losing something I read', so try to find a balance remember. Again effectiveness lies in the balance.; ,   If there are exercises along the way, such as journaling or reflection, try to do them on the day when you read the chapter that talks about them, when the instructions and purpose are fresh in your mind.  Try to find information and quotes from the book that can help you in your life. These quotes can serve as motivation as you proceed. Do not simply read; try to find the inner meanings of the information and understand its purpose.  Get a notepad before you start and write anything you find interesting into your notepad or get a highlighter and highlight all the main facts or information you find interesting in the book.  To make the implementation process organized, make a list consisting of things from the book to implement. For example suppose you learned about the concept of making people important genuinely, then you are more likely to succeed if you apply it right away without giving much time between getting the information and implementation of it.  Self help books contain advice, and are therefore written for a general audience. The authors do not know you personally, or your situation. As a simple example, many excellent gardening books are written in Vermont, but the information and advice in them may be completely inappropriate for California's climate and soils. Here are some things to ask yourself as you read:   Does the author have personal experience with this subject? Does the author have scientific or professional experience with this subject, or has he/she consulted the literature? Is the advice and experience recommended in the book relevant to your situation? Does the advice make sense, and does it make sense in your own life? How is the author motivated? Are they selling anything besides books? If the book gives financial advice, does the author use it him/herself, and does he/she stand to gain from others' following the advice? Is the book well regarded in the community? Why or why not? How do other works in the same subject area compare? Do they take similar approaches?  , Most successful people are those who implement it as soon as they learn something. This may sound like a cliché but the quicker you apply a concept after learning it the better you would be able to the grasp of it. For example if you learn about dance move and if you tried it right away without much delay, more quickly and easily you will learn it easily as compared to when you try to practice it after a delay. #  , A car without an engine will not work. Similarly, an idea without hard work will not work. When you read self help books and develop a new idea, work hard to make that idea reality, lest it remain an idea.  Some people do not focus, even when it is something that could change a life. Thus, read in a peaceful environment, as with any other book, and give the information your full attention. Read at a time and in an environment that encourages you to stay awake. Do not neglect important information.  Get a meeting place for your group and each time you meet up, read a chapter of the book and discuss the information. Give a notepad and pencil, and take turns sharing your thoughts.  What worked? What still needs work? Did you stick with the latest part of the plan? A little accountability can really help you get going.  If something which you learn you find good, share it with your friends and relatives and people who would be interested. This is not only a good thing to do but would also help you to grasp the concept better.  Small steps add up to big results. Remember the tortoise and the hare? The tortoise won the race because the hare became exhausted quickly. For the tortoise to win the race, there are a couple of things he needs to do.   Stick his neck out and get going.  Keep at it. Identify and follow the correct path.  So you started the program, and you see yourself getting stuck, or veering off course. Ask yourself why. Do you need to work harder? Do you need to work on smaller, more manageable parts? Is there information you're still missing? Do you hate what you're doing? If so, is it because you're trying to accomplish something difficult (such as quitting smoking), or because what you're trying to do isn't right for you? Your group can help you sort out these parts, also.	Know yourself to find a balance. Read just enough that you can implement: Information in self help books cannot be digested like a novel, so you'll get more out of them by focusing on some information a day and trying to digest that information before you go onto the next part. Pay attention to details. Be a student. Make a list. Read critically. Speed of implementation. Act. Be focused. Work in a group. Check back with your group as you all implement the advice. Share. Do a little at a time. Reevaluate, and correct.
Make sure to get sand all areas, including the edge, bottom and detailing.   Choose a liquid "de-glosser" if you are looking to limit the amount of physical work it takes to finish this project. It is a solvent that dulls glossy finishes.; ,   Some people use Trisodium Phosphate detergent, diluted in water, to clean the surface area. If you choose this method, rinse with water and let dry. Carefully dispose of the liquid according to local chemical disposal laws.  Ensure it will cover your melamine. Return it for another brand if it does not cover.  This is an important material in which to invest, as it will ensure a good cover over the melamine. Let it dry according to paint can directions.    If you want a finish that is similar to the melamine paint, choose an eggshell or pear finish. If you doubt the quality of your paint, use a paint conditioner to improve its performance. Let the object dry and set for a few days before using it in high-traffic areas.	Use 150 sandpaper to rough up all areas that you intend to paint. Wipe all areas clean with a brush or broom, and then wipe again with tack cloth. Use the bottom edge of your object to test your primer. Paint with a good quality bonding primer. Paint 1 to 2 coats of high-quality paint.
Having your equipment at the ready will ensure your pipe-sweating job goes as smoothly and quickly as possible. To properly sweat a copper pipe, you'll need:   Copper connectors Copper pipe Insulated gloves (optional; recommended) Lead-free plumbing solder Pipe cutter Pipe plug (optional; to prevent water trickles) Plumbing flux paste Propane torch Sandpaper or emery cloth Wire brush; , Construction materials vary considerably depending on purpose, and using the wrong gauge pipe or fitting can lead to a plumbing fiasco. If you are unsure which to use, check city code to determine your piping needs more exactly, but the following descriptions should help you evaluate whether your pipe is suitable for your job:   Copper pipe has three different classes -Type M, is thin walledType L, is medium walled, and is usually ideal for home useType K, is thick walled Copper pipe fittings come in three basic types -Category 1, for making bends or turns in your pipeCategory 2, for joining or branching pipeCategory 3, which includes couplings and adapters for your pipe., You'll need your pipe to be at the desired length for your plumbing project before you do anything. To accomplish this goal you should use a pipe cutter, which can be rented or purchased from most home improvement retailers. You may want to consider a pipe cutter that has guides, as these will help you accomplish a clean, straight cut that is free of rough edges.Tighten your pipe cutter, which should be shaped similar to a C-clamp, so that the pipe is firmly held by the cutter. Turn your cutter so that it scores the pipe as it rotates. Tighten your cutter again, and then turn it several more times until your pipe is severed. Depending on the thickness of your pipe and quality of your cutter, you may need to tighten the cutter a third time., If you don't have a pipe cutter available, there are a variety of tools you can use in place of it, though using a pipe cutter will often yield the best results. In a pinch, you can also use:   A hacksaw An abrasive wheel A portable or stationary band saw, You can smooth burred, sharp, or rough edges with fine grain sandpaper, an emery cloth, or even steel wool.After your pipe is smooth, you should clear any loose metal shavings left over from your pipe cutting with a clean rag.   When working with jagged or burred pipe, you may want to wear work gloves to protect against cuts and slivers.  You'll want to see if the copper piping and connectors fit together before going to the trouble of by assembling everything or applying flux. Insert the tube end into the fitting cup, and then visually examine it with your other parts to be sure these line up and fit properly.If you plan to work on a functioning copper pipe, be sure to turn off the water main or cut off valve.  You can achieve this by tipping the pipe, though in some cases this might not be possible. If you cannot tip-drain your pipe, use a dry, clean cloth or some paper towel to absorb all liquid near where you will be sweating the pipe.  This is necessary to promote the best possible joining between your component parts. Take your wire brush, and clean the pipe until it shines brightly. Give the joint ends the same treatment, until all the ends you will be sweating have a bright sheen.   After cleaning the pipe, wipe away any grit with a clean rag. Cleaning the pipe removes oxidation buildup from the metal, which can cause a weak bond. If you are connecting to a valve or other fixture, be sure it is open so you don't melt or warp any internal seals.  Although flux for potable fixtures is specifically intended to be non-toxic to your drinking water, flux that has yet to be heat treated can be harmful if it gets in your eyes or any open cuts. You should wear gloves when applying flux to your pipe., You shouldn't attempt to solder pipes that have residual water, as even a small amount of water can make your efforts futile. If you notice a trickle of water in your line, push a pipe plug into the line to stop the flow of water. In the event that you don't have a plug on hand, an old trick used a wad of soft, white bread in the place of a plug to briefly halt the water.   This technique does work, but has a minute chance of clogging aerators or valves when the line is turned on and the bread flushed., Copper pipe will not bond with the solder you will later apply to adhere your pipes together unless it is chemically treated with flux. Remember not to apply flux with your bare hands, as contact with your eyes, mouth, or open cuts could expose you to unsafe chemicals.Brush your plumbing flux paste on the outside of your pipe to prepare it for soldering.Flux creates a clean surface for the solder, which will bond your copper components together. Only a small amount of flux needs to be applied. Wipe away excess flux with a clean cloth.  You'll need to use your torch for this purpose. Hold your torch about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the fitting and pass it evenly over the part for about 10 to 20 seconds to warm the part and the flux. As the flux melts, it will first get shiny, then the copper should darken, and finally the flux should begin to sizzle and smoke slightly. This indicates that the pipe is ready for soldering.If you are inexperienced with working with a torch, especially to heat metal, you should wear insulated gloves to protect from accidental burns. Be careful to avoid burning your forearm, or any other part of your body, on the heated pipe, which will be hot to the touch. Focused or extreme heat is not necessary to melt your flux; the paste will melt at a relatively low temperature., Again, taking care not to burn yourself on a heated part, you should insert the tube end into the fitting cup firmly until you feel the tube come to rest against the base of the cup. Twist your pipe slightly to spread the flux evenly inside the joint., Now that your pieces are joined, you'll want to heat these again to prepare for the application of solder. Pass your torch evenly over the copper of the fitting. Unevenly heated copper could cause uneven melting of your solder and compromise your watertight seal.  You do not want to overheat your pipe and you should avoid applying your torch directly to your flux or solder as well. You can test to see if your pipe is ready for the solder by holding the solder to the pipe. If the solder runs, your pipe is at the right temperature.If your fitting glows or turns blue, you have applied too much heat and will have to wait for it to cool before trying again., Remove the heat and apply lead-free plumbing solder to the parts of your fitting where one part of the copper fits into another. Maneuver your solder so that it runs into the fit, continuing to apply the solder until it completely seals all gaps in the fitting the entire way around the pipe.If the joint forms a t-junction, begin at the base, move up to the top, and then down the other side. If the joint is vertical, move the solder around the joint, covering it evenly. If the copper is blackened or the solder beads, appears discolored, or drips out, your pipe may be too hot.  Never use acid core solder for sweating copper pipe., If you are new at sweating a pipe and work slowly, you may have to reheat part of a t-joint or elbow if your copper pipe has lost too much heat from its first torching. To protect any joints you have already soldered, place a thoroughly damp cloth on the parts you have already soldered, then carefully apply your torch to the part yet to be done.  This can be done simply by brushing a little more flux paste while the copper remains warm. Then you can wipe your newly sweated joint clean with a cloth.   Do not try to cool the pipe rapidly with water or you may damage the joint.Do not tighten the fixture you are soldering or move the joint until it has fully cooled.  After your copper has fully cooled and you've restored the flow of water to the line, leaks or drips mean you'll have to repeat the process again. Unfortunately, you will not be able to fix the problem by simply adding more solder to the joint, and will have to reheat the pipe, pull the joint apart, clean off previously applied materials, and start from the beginning.	Gather your tools and materials. Evaluate your pipe and fittings. Cut your copper pipe. Make use of secondary cutting measures. Smooth any rough edges and clean loose shavings. Test the fit of your components. Drain water from the pipe and dry it. Make your pipe shine. Protect yourself with gloves. Prevent trickles with a pipe plug. Apply flux to the joint you will sweat. Heat your fitting. Assemble the connecting pieces. Reheat the entire fitting. Test your fitting to verify proper soldering temperature. Begin to solder. Reheat complex joints. Clean the soldered joint. Check for leaks in your pipe.
To ensure that the salt glitter dries and the color sets, it helps to bake it in the oven. Set your oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully so it’s hot enough when you’re ready to dry the glitter.If you’re making the salt glitter with children, be sure to supervise their use of the oven.  Decide how much glitter you would like to make, and pour the same amount of salt into a clean bowl or tupperware container. Keep in mind that you’ll need a separate bowl for each color of glitter that you want to make.You can use any type of salt, but regular table salt works well. Make sure that the bowl or container you use is large enough for the amount of salt that you place in it. There should be enough room in the container to mix or shake the salt and coloring together.  Once you’ve added the salt to the bowl or container, squeeze several drops of food coloring over the salt to achieve the desired shade. Use a spoon to carefully mix the salt and coloring together so they’re fully combined.The amount of food coloring that you’ll need depends on how much salt you’re coloring and what shade you want the glitter to be. Larger amounts of salt require more coloring, as do darker colors. Be creative with the food coloring. You can mix two or more shades in a single batch of salt to create other shades. For example, if you don’t have green coloring, you can use equals amounts of blue and yellow to create a green shade. If your bowl or container has a lid, you can place the lid on it and shake the salt and coloring to combine them.  Once you’ve achieved the desired color for the glitter, carefully pour it out onto a cookie sheet or into a baking dish. Try to spread the glitter out in a single layer so it will dry more effectively.If you’re making multiple shades of glitter, it’s best to place them on separate cookie sheets. Otherwise, it can be extremely difficult to keep the glitter shades from mixing together when you remove them from the sheet.  After you’ve spread the glitter onto the cookie sheet, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the salt to bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the food coloring dries completely., Once the salt has finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the glitter cool completely, which should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes. When it’s cool, it’s ready for use.Once the salt glitter is cool, you can place it in jars or other storage containers.	Preheat the oven. Place some salt in a bowl or tupperware container. Add several drops of food coloring to the salt and mix. Spread the salt out onto a cookie sheet. Bake the salt for several minutes. Allow the salt glitter to cool.
It is also called calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide powder. This will give the body to your clay.; , You can choose either paraffin wax or beeswax. Paraffin wax emits toxic fumes when it is heated, so choosing beeswax will reduce the risk of bad reactions.  Find coconut oil or linseed oil from a natural food store. These 2 oils contain 8 percent stearic acid, which will help the mixture to stay smooth.  You will need to devote these to making clay, because the use of lime in the recipe will ensure they cannot be used for cooking again.  Put on a long-sleeved shirt and gloves. Also, use a dust mask and safety goggles to avoid problems from lime fumes.  Place them near the stove.  Place a large pot on your stove and fill it halfway with water. Bring the water to a boil.  Turn the burner down to medium heat.	Purchase hydrated lime from a home supply store or hardware store. Collect your wax to use as a binding agent. Buy baby oil and petroleum jelly from a local drugstore. Find some old heavy pots or saucepans and a wooden spoon. Wear safety gear. Line several baking trays with aluminum foil. Create a double boiler. Place a smaller pot inside the water to heat the ingredients.
To clean your Crane humidifier you will need water and four tablespoons of white vinegar. You will also need a soft, clean cloth if you choose to dry the humidifier base by hand instead of letting it air dry., It is important that you do not attempt to clean your Crane humidifier while it is plugged in. Doing so could result in injury to you or damage to the machine. Before cleaning the humidifier make sure you turn it off and unplug it from the power source.  You will need to remove the water tank from the base of the humidifier. You will be cleaning each part separately. Separate these parts of the humidifier as you prepare to clean it., If your humidifier has accessories, like diffusers, you will need to remove these parts. They will need to be cleaned separately from the humidifier tank and base.  Remove the water tank from the humidifier base and unscrew the cap. Add water until the tank is filled to or just below the maximum fill line., Measure out two tablespoons of white vinegar. Gently add the vinegar to the humidifier tank. For larger humidifiers, like the Crane smartDrop, you can add up to three tablespoons of white vinegar., After you add the vinegar and water to the tank, replace the cap and screw it on tightly. Then hold the tank with two hands and shake vigorously. You will want to shake the tank for at least 30 seconds., After you have vigorously shaken the vinegar solution in the tank, unscrew the cap. Pour the vinegar solution down the drain of a nearby sink or bathtub. Rinse the tank with water until the vinegar smell dissipates. Allow it to dry until next use.  If your humidifier has accessories like a diffuser, you will need to soak them in a solution of two tablespoons of white vinegar and one gallon of water for about 10 minutes. Then rinse and air dry the accessories.   Scrub away any build-up on these accessories with a dampened soft cloth or cotton swab.  After you have removed the humidifier tank from its base, fill the base with water. You will need to fill the base up to the maximum fill line., Once you have filled the humidifier base with water, you will need to add white vinegar to the base. Measure out two tablespoons of white vinegar and add them to the water in the base. Allow the vinegar and water to sit in the humidifier base for 30 minutes.  Pour the water and vinegar out of the base and down a nearby sink or bathtub drain. Be sure you empty all of the vinegar solution from the base.  Sometimes sludge can build up in the humidifier base. If this is the case, dip a soft cloth or cotton swab in the vinegar solution and use it to scrub out any hard-to-reach areas.  Rinse the base with cool water until the vinegar smell dissipates. Allow the base to air dry before you use it again. Alternatively, you can wipe the base dry with a clean, soft cloth.	Gather your supplies. Unplug the humidifier. Separate the water tank from the base. Remove any additional accessories. Fill the tank with water. Add white vinegar to the tank. Vigorously shake the tank. Empty, rinse, and dry the tank. Clean the accessories. Fill the base with water. Add white vinegar. Empty the base. Clean the nooks and crannies. Rinse and dry the base.
Your breathing needs to be relaxed to hit high notes. Otherwise, that tension goes right into your voice. Take a normal breath in, then exhale. Keep your breath slow and even.   Relax your shoulders, neck and chest as you continue to breathe in and out. This helps release tension from those areas.; , Put the heels of your hands on either side of your face, right below your cheekbones. Push them gently into your cheeks, then move them slowly down into your jaws. Let your mouth hang open a little bit. Repeat this several times., Slowly roll your neck from side to side. Once your neck feels stretched out, roll your shoulders gently and slowly, backward and forward. Then let your arms hang loosely at your sides.Try to keep your arms loose as you practice. Avoid the urge to ball up your fists or strain your arm muscles when trying to hit high notes.  It also helps hydrate the vocal chords, allowing you to reach the higher registers. Add honey to your water to decrease and/or prevent their throat from swelling.Don't drink ice water, caffeine or milk before warming up your voice. These can have a negative effect on your singing voice.  Press your lips together loosely. Release air through your mouth in a steady stream, so that your lips vibrate and make a raspberry sound. Move on to doing this with “h” sounds, maintaining a steady voice as you move the air past your lips.  Once you’ve got that, try it on “b” sounds. Then continue doing “b” sounds, but go up and down the scales., It helps to imagine you’re sucking down a spaghetti noodle! When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. Keep your “woo” steady and repeat this 2-3 more times.   After that, start going up and down the scales as you “woo.”, Starting in a low pitch, sing a “me” sound as you go up the scale. Reverse and go down the scale as you sing an “ee” sound. Keep going, up and down, gently increasing your range each time.   Once you’re feeling pretty loose, switch to an “oo” sound and repeat.During warm up, don't push your voice to go higher than what’s comfortable for you. This can actually decrease your range over time., As a singer, you’ve probably heard this advice countless times. It’s important, though! It helps you hit and maintain high notes, and helps to relax your muscles.When you inhale, your stomach should rise first, followed by your chest. If you have trouble with this, try putting your hand on your abdomen as you breathe. It’ll remind you to focus on breathing from that area.  This can be a continuation of the “oo” and “ee” sounds you used in warm-up. Once you get your voice up into the high register that you want, open up those vowel sounds to sound more like “oh” and “uh.”As you practice this over time, you’ll notice that the higher notes are getting easier and easier to reach.  Each voice has certain vowels that work best when singing high notes. Others are harder to hit. You should experiment to determine which vowels work and sound best for you. Once you have an idea of which vowel works best, modify (gradually) towards that vowel as you ascend the scale.   For example, you might have a hard time hitting a long "e" (like in "meet"), but you can easily hit a short "i." You could modify the long "e" in "meet" by singing "mitt" and subtly adjusting the "i" into the long "e" as you get higher., Consonants, like a hard “g,” can help you get better at cord closure. After practicing vowels for a while, put a hard “g” in front of them. This helps you maintain a steady sound by keeping your vocal cords vibrating steadily.Also work on consonants like “m” and “n” in front of vowels. Cord closure is when your vocal cords come together to create a sound. If they aren’t “closed” all the way, it's difficult to maintain steady air flow., When rehearsing, never hesitate to sing the word "yawn" for one of those notes in your upper range. When you sing that word, it positions your mouth and throat in exactly the right place to hit high notes. This is a handy trick to help you get used to the proper mouth positioning; don't do this during a performance, though!  , Steady airflow allows you to hit and maintain your high notes. As you work on your range, keep your breath flowing in and out steadily. Strive to make smooth, connected sounds.Think about the whole phrase that includes the high note, then support your voice continuously from the beginning. This connects the high note to the notes before it. Forcing out air on certain notes can strain your throat and voice.  Working on high notes is hard on your vocal cords. To keep those muscles operating well, cool them down after you work them out. To do this, hum gently while making an “m” sound. Move up and down the scales as you make the “m” sound.Focus on how the sound feels coming out of your lips. It will vibrate and tickle a little bit!	Take slow, relaxed breaths to release tension. Massage your face and jaw muscles to release jaw tension. Do some neck and shoulder rolls to loosen up the muscles. Drink a glass of warm water to relax throat muscles. Trill with your lips to warm them up. Stretch out your vocal chords with “sirens.” Round your mouth into an “o” position and inhale. Do two octave scales to warm up for higher notes. Breathe from your abdomen for a stronger sound. Start in the middle of your range and sing higher and higher. Experiment with your vowel sounds. Start putting a consonant in front of vowels. Sing the word "yawn" on the high notes to get your mouth in position. Keep your sounds smooth and connected. Cool down after each session to prevent injury.
The two main varieties are Imperial and Murcott. Imperials have thin, waxy leaves and soft, dark green fruit. The fruit hangs mostly inside the tree, hidden from the sun, draped down off the branches in big patches. Murcotts can be identified by an abundance of thorns, dense, hard fruit in large patches, and high exposure of fruits to sunlight.; , Mark the spot which you begin, and circle around the tree, moving clockwise if you are right-handed, and counter-clockwise if you are left-handed. Murcott fruits burn easily and grow together in thick patches of doubles, triples, and quadruples; leave no doubles or triples and space each fruit a fist apart minimum. remove external fruits on the outside six inches for the bottom sixty centimeters, and the outer twelve inches above that. Keep the larger and unmarked fruits. Imperials have more smalls, which must be removed, and the internal fruit is least valuable, so all outside fruit must be left on and spaced properly. Any sunburned fruits can also be removed. Moving once around the tree is sufficient.  Throw the ladder inside the tree, hooking the ladder over branches if necessary to reach the inside and top of the tree. Remove all fruit off the top twelve inches of a Murcott. Simply space the Imperials and remove the smalls.  Climb inside the tree, up the branches, reaching all the remaining fruits hiding or otherwise out of reach.  Go around the tree once more to check your work. Look for any remaining spacing, sizing, or quality issues and correct them. Examine the tree from different distances, looking at the bottom external branches, inside and under the branches, and outside the top.	Determine the tree variety; each must be thinned differently. Thin the bottom seven feet of the tree by walking around and it on foot. Use a picking ladder to thin the top of the trees. Thin the inside of tree. Check the tree. Next tree!
Seedlings should not be used since they do not transplant well. Remember to obtain two separate sets of seeds for cross pollination.; , This will help pull them out of their dormant state. Specific directions for the particular variety of paw-paw you have purchased will come with the seeds.  Plant the seeds 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) deep into the soil. Water thoroughly and cover the pot with a clear plastic bag. (Poke holes in the top for ventilation!)  , Water daily for a month, until the seeds sprout.  They may not survive in full sunlight, so keep this in consideration.  Using a paintbrush or something soft, rub a flower of one paw-paw tree to collect pollen. Then proceed to rub a flower of another tree. *Note: You cannot take pollen from one tree and use it on the same tree! Each individual flower will only accept pollen from a flower from a genetically distinct individual tree.  It will take three years before you can start harvesting your fruits. When they turn a brownish yellow, they are ready to be picked.	Obtain paw-paw seeds. Refrigerate the seeds. Fill 4-inch pots with compost or seed starter soil. Place in a sunny window or outside spot. Find a good spot to plant your sprouted pawpaws. Pollinate Paw Paws when they start to bloom. Care for the paw-paw.
Texting during a show is fine, just don't make calls and make an issue for other people.  Taking pictures with your cellphone is distracting; not to mention it blocks the view for the people behind you. Those who spend the entire show recording the gig on their cameras or phone are not living in the moment. Though you might want to capture an amazing shot, you'll most likely miss out on something better by being distracted with your camera or phone.	Wait for an intermission before making phone calls. Use your cellphone/camera sparingly.
, Include the shape of the garden bed plus landmarks like trees, bushes, fences, and walls.    Vary the color of the flowers and foliage. Plan to put the same kind of plant in several places so the colors will repeat. This creates more visual appeal. Place plants according to height. The tallest plants should go in the back or center of the garden and the shortest in the front or around the edges. Plant perennials with varied blooming schedules so your garden will display colorful flowers throughout the year. Consider the light requirements of the plants. You may be able to arrange your plants so the tallest receive full sun while the shortest plants are shaded. Generally, however, you will have to limit your choices according to how much sun the garden gets.  Show each plant in the cluster.   Clusters consisting of odd numbers of plants arranged in triangular patterns are the most visually appealing.    Small plants need 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) between them Medium-sized plants need 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) between them. Tall plants need 18 to 36 inches (45 to 90 cm) between them.	Measure the site you've chosen for your garden.  , Draw the garden site to scale on graph paper. Choose your perennial plants and decide where to put them. Specify the locations where clusters of the same plant will be planted. Leave enough space between plants to accommodate growth.
Start by making a simple chain. You can make the chain as long or as short as you want it to be. Just keep in mind that this will serve as the backdrop for your motifs, so make sure to make it large enough to sew all of them onto.For example, you could make a small backdrop by chaining 40, or make a large backdrop by chaining 150. It’s up to you and what you need to complete your design.  To begin your first row, single crochet into the tenth chain from the hook. This will make a small chain loop., Next, chain six stitches, skip three chains and then single crochet into the base chain. This will create another chain loop. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row., When you get to the end of your row, make a chain of nine for your turning chain. This will help to provide slack to work the next row and it will also serve as your first chain loop., Start your new row with a single crochet stitch into the next loop in your row. Then, chain six stitches. Then, skip three and single crochet to connect the stitches. Repeat this sequence to the end of the row. Follow the last chain of six with a single crochet stitch. Chain nine and turn your work again and then repeat the second row until your backdrop is the length you want it to be.  When you have finished several motifs and your background is complete, thread a needle with the same color thread as your yarn and then begin sewing your motifs onto the background. You can place them however you like.  You may want to start by pinning them on to see how you would like to arrange them, and then sew them in place when you are happy with the arrangement.	Make a chain that is as long as you want your backdrop to be. Single crochet into the tenth chain from the hook. Chain six, skip three, and single crochet. Finish the first row with a chain of nine, and turn. Work a single crochet into the next loop, chain six, and skip three. Sew your motifs onto your background.
Look for a hollowed shell that is big enough to house a succulent plant and some dirt. Succulent plants don’t require as much water as other indoor houseplants and can thrive in a smaller habitat like the inside of a seashell.Look for larger clamshells or other seashells that are of a suitable size. Scour beaches and try to find a hallowed shell.  There are also online stores that sell hallowed seashells.You can also find man-made synthetic seashells online.  You can use soil that you’ve found in the yard or fertilizer. Succulents thrive in loose soil that has good drainage. When choosing a soil choose things like coarse sand or perlite with potting soil to create good drainage.Make sure to fill your shell outside or over a sink so that you don’t make a mess.  You can also purchase succulent specific soils at most home and gardening stores.  Use your finger, or a chopstick to create a hole in the soil. Place your succulent into the holes that you make. Place more holes for more succulents until you have a full arrangement within your planter. Once your plants are in the holes, you can put more soil to fill the remainder of the holes and hold your plants in place.When placing your holes, make sure to do so strategically so that your arrangement is aesthetically pleasing to you.  While this step is optional, decorating your planter with paint or small gems is a good way to enhance its look and make it more unique. One method of painting your shell is to use watercolor paint. Mix colors together to create a tie dye seashell planter.Another method of painting is to use a metallic spray paint and spray the shells to give them a shiny, metallic look.Lastly, you can hot glue small gems or stones onto the surface of the shell to give it a more glamorous feeling., Because these planters are more delicate and are likely to get destroyed if placed outside, it’s probably a good idea to keep them inside your house. Find a place, like a window that leads to outside, where the succulents can get enough sunlight.  Allow the soil to dry out before watering your seashell planters., Find the small holes that are usually found in many shells and thread a fishing line through them in order to hang them. If there are no holes in your shells, you can drill small pilot holes using an electric drill.Hang the planters in areas that won’t obstruct people’s walking paths.  Good locations to hang your miniature planters include the porch or a shed.	Find a suitable seashell. Fill your shell ¾ of the way with soil. Plant your succulent into the soil. Decorate your seashell planter. Place your miniature seashell planters on a shelf or windowsill. Hang your seashell planters with fishing line.
If all of the walls in the room are the same, neutral color (e.g. white or off-white), you could choose a bolder color to paint this wall.For example, cooler colors, such as blue and green, will provide a calming feel.For a more energizing feel, choose warmer colors.; , If you don’t want to paint the wall, you could choose a bold wallpaper to make the wall more interesting. For example, you might find an interesting argyle pattern or one with a vintage pattern that will give you something to look at besides a plain wall., Color blocking means choosing two or three completely different colors, and then putting them together to create something that looks interesting.For a wall, this can mean painting the wall with different colors, or hanging squares (or whatever shape you would like) of each color. It can even mean simply choosing posters that are made up of one primary color., You can do this by having a picture that you like blown up to a very large, and having it printed as a poster that you can hang on the wall, or having it made into a wall decal you can stick onto your wall.This will make the wall very interesting to look at.   Alternatively, if you don’t already have a picture in mind, you can visit home decor stores, which commonly sell pre-made wall murals. Typically, these are applied as decals, which make it easy to stick to the wall.  This is done by painting the bottom part of the wall in one color, and painting the top part of the wall in a different tone of the same color. Typically the wall is divided in half, but you can do it however you like.If your wall has wainscoting or bead boarding, which is the decorative panelling that is sometimes present on the bottom portion of a wall, you can use this as a guide to help you decide where to divide the tones.You can also have wainscoting installed to help break up the wall, if you don’t have it already.  Maybe you rent, and aren’t allowed to paint or nail into the wall, or maybe you want to be able to change your decorations easily. Either way, Washi tape offers a way to decorate your wall in whatever way you want.Washi tape is essentially masking tape with different designs on it. It comes in many, many different colors and designs. You could try taping large stripes on the wall, or creating a design of your own in the center of the wall.	Make it an accent wall. Use an interesting wallpaper. Utilize color blocking. Place a mural. Create a two-tone wall. Use Washi tape to decorate the wall.
In many states you are in your full right to shoot the person, but this, for most people, is a bit drastic. You should decide ahead of time (even before you own a firearm for personal defense) what your personal morals will allow you to do in this and other situations. Read some information on tactical mindsets if you need help deciding.  You need to give fair warning before shooting. If you have identified the intruder, and they have already tried to harm you, you may not need to provide additional warning.   Keep in mind there may be more than one adversary in the house; additionally, being shot is not synonymous with dying, so keep yourself behind cover as much as possible.  Chances are you are unsure of who your adversary is or do not know his intentions. (Realize an intruder may mask their intentions — and someone who broke into your house is probably not there to borrow sugar.) Present yourself, by surprise if possible, and order the target with short, firm phrases. Once you have gotten your targets attention with "STOP!" "Hands in the air!" try directing the intruder by saying "Face away from me!" and "Get on your knees!"   Having him face away from you and keeping him on his knees prevents him from retaliating against you, and keeps him from moving anywhere quickly without a good deal of movement. If he has a firearm in his hand, be sure to tell him to drop it! If he does not comply immediately, he is only contemplating the best way to shoot you with it. Re-emphasize the point with "...else I will shoot you!", then take appropriate action. If he decides to slowly set it down, tell him to "STOP!" and "DROP IT!" There have been many police shootings which involved a person slowly setting down a gun, then changing their mind and shooting the police instead. It will take at least 1/8th of a second from the time they start to bring up their firearm until your brain can react. This is plenty of time for them to fire before you know what is going on.  Do the right thing and eliminate the threat. Hesitating will not save your life. You'll only have the luxury of defending your actions if you're physically there to testify. A breach of your property rights must be met with swift action.   You may want to consider also carrying either pepper spray or a taser for these situations. It will be much easier to defend your decision to spray or taser an intruder who is simply belligerent than it would be to defend shooting a belligerent intruder.  Since you have already called the police, or have a cell phone on you, the police should not be too far behind.   If for some reason you do not have a cell phone on you, you did not already call the police, and a phone is not within visual range of the intruder, you can have him move while on his knees, be sure he doesn't turn to face you.  Place yourself in a location of cover and be sure he doesn't have any buddies that may come around a corner. You have announced your presence to the whole house, so another adversary in the house will know exactly where you are, but you can't risk leaving the man you have left alone or out of sight.  Again, this includes any small area where a miss on one man may be a hit on the other. Multiple targets add a great deal of complexity to a situation, but the truth is that most criminals do not work alone.   Telling multiple adversaries to "STOP!" is a bad idea. By the time you are able to engage one for not complying, the other could have attacked you. Try to decide ahead of time in your mind what you will do if you encounter multiple adversaries.	If you spot your target, you have a couple options. Identify yourself. Do not jump to conclusions. If the person decides to disregard your commands, or makes a sudden move, act decisively. Wait for the police to come. Keep a close eye on the intruder on the ground, but be observant. Allow multiple adversaries to enter a fatal funnel of sorts.
, For drawers, only the outer portion on show needs painting. Allow all to dry; this is now the undercoat layer.  Don't press too hard or you'll sand through to the wood. Wipe the dust off with a soft, clean rag.   If you do sand too deeply, repaint the undercoat on that spot before painting the next layer.  This becomes the top coat. Allow to dry.   Paint with long brush strokes and light pressure. Only use the tip of the paintbrush bristles.  Again, do not press too hard or you'll need to reapply the paint if you reach the undercoat or wood.  Use the same long, gentle strokes from the tip of the paintbrush to get a perfect finish. Let dry.  The refinish will be glossy, shiny and durable.	Prepare the dresser as above.  , Paint the dresser frame and the drawers. Sand the undercoat layer lightly with 220 grit sandpaper. Paint the next layer. Sand lightly with 320 grit sandpaper. Paint the final coat. Reassemble the dresser.
Any glass bottle will do for your glass art. This includes, but isn't limited to, soda bottles, beer bottles, wine bottles, condiment bottles, perfume bottles, and so on. Before your chosen bottle is ready to melt, you need to make sure it is clean and dry. This includes any labels or even fingerprints that may be on it!   Labels that are difficult to remove can be soaked in hot, soapy water. A good soak for a few hours or overnight should make the labels easier to peel off.You'll also have to remove any glue that remains from the label. After a soak in hot, soapy water, you can usually scrape the glue off without much ado. A tool like a putty knife, wallpaper scraper, or an unwanted credit card can help. If your bottles have labels that appear painted, like Corona or Belvedere bottles, you can melt your bottle with these still in place. However, after melting, those labels will be permanently melted to your bottle.; , Kilns can become dirty over time, collecting dust and bits of debris from other projects. This dirtiness can have a negative impact on your kiln's heating elements and can severely shorten the working life of your kiln. To prevent an expensive and unnecessary cost to yourself, before you use your kiln you should thoroughly clean it according to the manual's instructions.While you're cleaning you'll have a perfect chance to give your kiln a quick safety inspection. Tighten any screws that seem loose, remove any flammable material from around your kiln, and verify that all kiln equipment is in good working order.  To guarantee your kiln is running as desired, you should consider giving your kiln a test run. You should always use the testing materials and procedure recommended by your manual, but generally, you can test your kiln with a 04 self-supporting Witness Cone. Place one of these on each shelf about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the kiln wall. Then you should:   Set your kiln to run the appropriate test setting, which will be a medium speed 04 ConeFire program if you are using an 04 cone. Allow the program to run for the complete time indicated. After the program has run and your kiln sufficiently cooled, take a look at your cones or testing material. If using a Witness Cone, you should notice a 20° bend or greater in the cone, with no cones hanging lower than the shelf. If you used other testing materials, check your manual to learn how to understand the results of your test. If after running the ConeFire program none of your cones have bent, this may be an indication that your heating element or a relay may have decayed. In this case, you may need to call a professional, like a kiln technician, to get your kiln back in working order., If you don't protect the surfaces your melted glass is going to come in contact with, your glass will fuse to those surfaces. An application of kiln wash or glass separator on your shelf and mold will prevent the glass from sticking to either of these.   An alternative you might use in place of a kiln wash is special kiln resistant paper, like thin-fire or fiber paper. These will also prevent your glass from melting to your kiln or molds., Molding and slumping are the two main techniques used in glass melting. Generally, molding is where you melt your glass in a kiln and allow it to fill a mold, giving the glass a new shape. Slumping is where you allow the glass to collapse inward on itself to create a unique, freeform shape that might make a suitable table centerpiece or paperweight, among other things.   You can also choose a hybrid of these two techniques. Glass slump molds are available at some art/ceramics stores and online. Using these, you can slump your glass into the approximate shape of a mold. This is great for making spoon holders, shallow bowls, and vases., A firing profile divides the heating and cooling process of your kiln into segments. Each segment requires that you change the in-kiln temperature at a certain rate, holding the temperature at certain benchmarks. The firing profile you use will influence the finished product of your glass art and will depend on the kind of glass you use.   Different kinds of glass are made by different chemical processes. Some kinds of glass will react better to one firing profile better than another, so you may have to experiment before you find the best profile for your glass melting.Many firing profiles are available free online, though some may have come with the manual of your kiln. In some cases, the firing profile recommended by your kiln manufacturer might not produce good results. In this case, you'll have to tweak your profile., Now that your bottles and kiln are clean, your kiln inspected and tested, and your surfaces covered to prevent glass from fusing, you're almost ready to melt your glass. But first, you should position your bottle stably in a central position in your kiln.   If you are using a mold, it should surround your bottle or be positioned in a way that your bottle fills the mold as it melts. The best positioning will depend entirely on the kind of kiln you are using., The first segment of your heating is intended to warm the bottle and should not exceed a rate of 500°F (260°C). You may even want to choose a lower rate for slower heating. This will add time to the melting process, but will protect your mold, if you are using one, from cracking because of thermal shock.As your kiln achieves the temperature indicated in each segment of your firing profile, you should hold that temperature for however long indicated in the profile. This is usually a short period of time, around 10 - 12 minutes in many cases. You should always wear the appropriate safety gear recommended by your kiln manual when operating your kiln. In many cases this will include heat resistant gloves and safety googles.  After your kiln has reached 1100°F (560°C), it should be softening the glass. The thinner sections of your bottle, like the middle parts, should begin collapsing. You'll want to keep the temperature throughout the bottle consistent at this stage for best results. A lower ramp rate of about 250°F (121°C) is recommended for this purpose.   The hold time, at this point, will be a little longer than preceding hold times. This longer hold time gives the temperature a chance to equalize., At this point in your firing profile, your kiln will be reaching temperatures that should be causing the bottle to slump in earnest. From 1300°F (704°C) you should ramp at 300°F (148°C) per hour until you reach temperatures of about 1430°F (776°C).   Once your kiln is at the peak temperature in your firing profile, you should allow for a hold time of about 10 minutes. Slight variations in hold time and temperature will influence the how much your bottle melts., Annealing is where you allow your glass to rest at a temperature below its freezing point, which is a little below 1000°F (537°C) for many kinds of glass. Hold this temperature for about one hour per ¼ inch (.64 cm) of thickness to relieve stress on your glass art, which will make it less prone to cracking.Once the inside of your kiln has reached room temperature, you can open it and remove your glass. Be careful when doing so, as the glass may still be hot to the touch. Opening your kiln before it has naturally cooled to room temperature may cause thermal shock. This could cause your glass to crack or shatter., Glass that is crushed up into small pieces is referred to as frit. If your kiln isn't level and you are having a difficult time keeping your bottle positioned as you desire, you can sprinkle some pieces of frit to either side of the bottle to prevent it from rolling.   Once the bottle begins to slump, it will lose its roundness and rolling will no longer be an issue. Until then, your frit should keep your bottle in place., When your glass bottle gets too hot, it can fold inward to the lower areas of your mold and create dangerous sharp edges. Decrease your peak temperature by 10° increments until you get the results you desire.   You can also blunt sharp edges by decreasing your hold time. Shorten the time by 5 minutes or less in your future firings. If the sharp edges remain, continue to decrease the hold time in this fashion. In some cases, you may have the best results by lowering your temperature and shortening your hold time. You'll have to experiment to find what works best for the glass and kiln you are using., Melting glass is a very precise process. Even the difference of a few degrees or minutes can completely change the outcome of your glass art project. You should pay special attention to temperature, hold times, ramp rates, and the kind of glass you are melting., There are many small factors that can have a significant affect your glass melting. The time you hold your temperature benchmarks, the rate of increase/decrease in temperature, the number of bottles you're trying to melt in a single firing -- all of these factors play a part in how your glass melts.But with a little time and practice, you'll soon be creating beautiful glass art melting bottles.	Collect and clean your old glass bottles. Clean your kiln. Test your kiln. Prepare your mold and shelf, if necessary. Choose between molding or slumping. Determine your firing profile. Insert your glass into the kiln. Heat your kiln. Lower your ramp rate but continue heating. Melt the bottle as desired. Allow your melted glass to anneal. Balance rolling bottles with frit. Prevent sharp, jagged edges in your melted bottle. Take notes on your melting procedure. Perfect your glass melting technique.
Raise up both of your arms so they are going straight out from your shoulders. Then, bend one arm in towards your body, as if you are preparing to sneeze into your sleeve.Keep the other arm straight.; , Next tuck your forehead down towards the arm that is bent and touch your forehead to your elbow area as if you are sneezing into your sleeve or dabbing sweat off of your brow.Keep the other arm straight.         Straighten out your arm after you dab your forehead on it.  After you bring your head in towards your elbow, you can do a quick head bang motion (or two) before you straighten out your arm and switch sides.Just quickly jolt your head forward towards your elbow.          Head banging is generally considered safe, but keep in mind that is can cause injuries if you do it too hard.You can always skip the head bang motion if you have concerns.  You can repeat the dab multiple times on one side or switch sides. If you switch sides, then repeat the same dab movement on the other side with your other arm. For example, if you started by dabbing on your left side, then switch over to your right side.          Keep switching back and forth along with the music.  You can do the dab movement with your upper body and move your lower body however you like. You can hop around, walk around, or wiggle your hips.          You can also do other moves in between dabs, such as waving your fists in the air or moving your arms from side to side in front of you.Add your own flair and just try to have fun!	Lift your arms out to your sides. Tuck your head down. Bang your head into your elbow. Switch sides. Move around.
This can be on your couch or sitting down, make sure it is comfortable though and you have minimum disturbances.; , You might want to get healthy snacks, as you won't be doing a whole lot of exercise. Also, you might want to grab a snack that is not real messy, because if it is messy you have to clean up after it.  This is important if the sound is to high then you could hurt your ears or disturb somebody. But if it too low (for any reasons) then you could not hear it and this will severely affect how well you enjoy the show. If you have to have a low volume, then try turning on the subtitles or try sitting closer to the TV(not to close, as this could disturb your eyes).  This may vary if you are using NETFLIX or watching it off a DVD. But make sure you know where it is(what channel, location of DVD etc) or you won't be watching that show.  Having to get up, will make you miss pieces of the show. , A lot of people don't do this, but you can get a better user experience and that might make you come back for more. ,	Find a comfy spot where you can see your TV. Grab any snacks you'd like to eat while watching this hilarious, but stupid show. Turn on TV and adjust the sound levels. Turn on the channel that has Spongebob on it. Look at the TV with your snacks and remote near you. Eat while watching.  , Watch the whole show, including the review for the next episode. Tell all of your friends about the show that came on and try to make them laugh.  , This could prepare you for some Spongebob cosplay or fanfics, so making sure you watched the show properly is important.

Moss roses are well-known for their combination of beauty and durability. They suit most climates well, and amply reward their caretakers with amazing blooms. However, they do have a few quirks, so double-check to make sure your garden can support them.   Moss roses are succulents, storing water in large, fleshy leaves. This means that they will be fine if you forget to water them.They can grow in poor soil or even rock gardens.However, they might drown in a very rainy climate. Moss roses are low-lying, rarely topping six inches in height. They are good for borders and pots, but do not command large-scale attention on their own.Moss roses can absorb the carbon dioxide from car exhaust especially efficiently. This means that they are sometimes used to line driveways, or parking lots.Though some varieties of their seeds are edible to humans, moss roses are toxic to pets. Do not plant them where a dog or cat can snack on them.; , Now that you know you’re ready for moss roses, it’s time to figure out where to put them. Since moss roses love sun, make sure they will get full sunlight for at least part of the day. If you are planning to use them in a flower display, plan to put them in front, as portulaca plants are low-lying.   To know how many moss rose plants you need for a border, measure the length in yards or meters, then divide by three--that’s the number of roses you need to fill the border with plenty of space between the young plants. Don’t worry; moss roses grow fast, so you won’t have gaps for long.You don’t have to plant moss roses outside. They are pretty in pots, too, as long as they get plenty of sunlight., If you are a more confident gardener, you may already be planning to work with seeds. If you would prefer to begin your garden with a little bit of a head start, seedlings may work for you. There are pros and cons to each, so think about it and decide which suits you better.Seeds are cheaper, and you can start growing them (indoors or outdoors) whenever you’re ready. However, it can be difficult to wait two weeks for them to germinate, and then an additional month until they're sturdy enough to move. Seedlings are convenient and already healthy, but because a greenhouse has done the work of germination for you, they are often expensive.  You can buy moss rose seedlings at any local greenhouse, since they are popular summer plants, though they may be tricky to find in grocery stores. Seeds can also be found in greenhouses or garden supply stores, or well-reviewed online shops.  If you're using seeds and experiencing a long winter, you should start growing inside. This will keep the seedlings warm and protected until you’re ready to plant them outdoors. Your specific seed variety will probably have instructions, but in general, moss roses grow in similar ways.   Place seeds uncovered on shallow dry soil (a few inches deep is fine) and keep at room temperature.You can sprinkle them with a little water every few days, but they don’t need much. The seeds should germinate within two weeks, but wait an additional month before you move them., Moss roses are used to balmy summer climates. As hardy as they are with little water, a cold snap can easily kill them.Keep seedlings inside until you’re certain the ground won’t freeze. Treat them as you would if they were outside--make sure they get full sun and a sprinkle of water every now and then.  Once the frost is gone for good, it’s time to plant your seeds or seedlings outside. Make sure to space them out (12 inches, or .3 meters, is great) and cover them with minimal soil. They should be thriving in no time.   If you live in a warm area, you can plant seeds directly--just scatter them on the ground and cover with a little seeding soil.If you’re transplanting home-grown or commercial seedlings into the warmed ground, dig a small hole the size of the container the seedlings are in, then lift up the plant by its base and place it into the hole., Plan to baby your moss roses for their first few days outside. For about a week, water them on a daily basis, since the roots have not yet expanded to fill the full area needed to get water to the whole plant.After this first week, you can water them less frequently.  You should try to mimic desert rain habits by watering the plants thoroughly, and letting them dry out before watering them again. Watering them about once a week will usually work well. Make sure they don’t experience too much runoff from other plants that need more water.  Not only would it be a tragedy to lose the flowers, but they could poison the animals you know. You probably already planted the seeds where they couldn’t be reached by your own pets--make sure to prevent other pets in the neighborhood from running amok through your garden, too., This is one of the few tasks you will have to do for your portulaca on a frequent basis once your plant is settled. Manually removing blossoms that have gone to seed ensures that your plants replace dead flowers. To deadhead, take a firm hold on a dried-up bloom, and them pull steadily. It will come off, revealing the bud of a new flower beneath it.Save a few of the heads if you want to reuse the seeds next year.  Moss roses are nearly as versatile as many weeds, but they can still be choked out if you don’t remove invasive plants. Weed weekly at the very least, for the amount of water your garden gets, and its fertility, are both factors in how many weeds your garden will attract.  Most moss rose varieties are annuals, which means that they don’t live past the autumn. You can replant them next year, even using the seeds you collected when deadheading them. Just crush the old flowers to reveal the seeds, then place them in an envelope and keep it in a cool, dry place until next year.	Find out if moss roses are right for you. Plan out your planting. Decide if you want seeds or seedlings. Get your flowers. Grow seeds indoors. Wait until after the last frost to plant outside. Plant outside. Make sure that the roots are set. Water your moss roses. Keep away from pets. Deadhead your plants. Weed your plants. Repeat the process next year.
Before you begin cleaning, sort through the coins to determine which coins need the most work. Split your coins into three categories: showing good detail, showing some detail, and showing no detail.Start working on the coins that need the least amount of work. Dirt can probably be removed by simply soaking them in distilled water. You may want to have the coins that need a lot of work cleaned by a professional.; , It will take time to clean your ancient coins. Over-cleaning the coin can damage it and diminish the value of the coin. Also, some coins will have harder or more difficult deposits that will require more work. You may have to try multiple methods to get the coins clean. Start with the safest and least abrasive methods before you move on to something else., Place your coins in distilled water. The distilled water will absorb the materials that are on your coin and loosen the dirt. Do not use tap water because it may contain ions and mineral that will inhibit the cleaning process. Try scrubbing the coin with a toothbrush after it has been soaking for a few days. Change the water every few days as well.This is a slow process and may take many months until your coin is clean.  If soaking in water alone has not helped, try to using some liquid soap to clean the coins.after you have applied soap and water to the coin, use a toothbrush to scrub the coin. If you do not have a toothbrush, you can use another stiff brush. However, never use a metal brush because the bristles will scratch your coin., Washing your coins with olive oil is the safest way to clean your coins as you cannot leave the coins in olive oil for too long. It has been used for years and is very reliable. Put olive oil in a closed container, and then place your coins in the container. Change the oil once or twice a month. If you want to speed up the process, gently scrub the coin with a toothbrush.Wait at least a week before you scrub the brush with a toothbrush. Scrub the coin with dish soap under running water. Place it back in the olive oil if it is still dirty.This is the slowest way to clean a coin. It may take months before you begin to see results.	Sort your coins. Be patient. Soak in water. Use soap and water. Soak in olive oil.
Secure the ponytail with a hair tie, preferably one that matches your hair color. Make sure that the hair going into the ponytail is smooth.This style works best on longer hair.  You want to have a top section and a bottom section. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to divide the ponytail, if needed., Bring the bun maker all the way down to the base of the ponytail. Clip the hair in the bun maker out of the way for now.Use a large bun maker that matches your hair color. Bun makers look like doughnuts, except that they are made out of a spongy, netted material  , Split the bottom half of the ponytail into three sections. Cross the left and right sections over the middle one until you reach the end of your hair. Secure the braid with a clear hair elastic. This part of the style is now complete.  If you have thin hair, gently tug on the outer loops forming the braid to fluff it up and give it some volume.  Unclip the upper half of the ponytail. Use your hands to smooth the hair around the bun maker so that it is no longer visible. Slide a clear hair elastic over the bun, pinching the hair underneath it.If you can't cover the bun maker completely with your hair, switch to a smaller size.  Your hair will be coming out from under the bun maker after the previous step. Gather all that hair, and pull it towards the back of your head. Split this hair into three sections., When you are done, you should have three mini braids coming out of the back of your bun. Secure each braid with a clear hair elastic.It might be a good idea to clip the other sections out of the way while you work on the braids.  Take the right mini braid. Pull it upward and wrap it counterclockwise around the top part of the bun. Make sure that the center of the bun is still visible. Tuck the end of the braid down against the bun, then secure everything with bobby pins.Use bobby pins that match your hair color.  Bring the middle mini braid upward, and wrap it counterclockwise around the bun, just below top braid. Tuck the end down, as before, and secure everything with bobby pins., Take the final mini braid. Wrap it counterclockwise around the base of the bun. Try to cover the gap between the middle braid and your head. Tuck the tail under the bun, then secure everything with bobby pins., You are now ready to attend important ceremonies and award those who helped you save the galaxy!	Brush your hair and pull it into a high ponytail. Split the ponytail in half horizontally. Pull the top half of the ponytail through a bun maker. Braid the bottom half of the ponytail. Spread your hair over the bun maker and secure it with an elastic. Split the excess hair into three sections. Braid each section separately. Wrap right braid around the top of the bun and secure it with pins. Wrap the middle braid around the bun. Wrap the final braid around the base of the bun. Set the style with hairspray.
Are you noticing stains or puddles under your car, but aren’t sure what they are? This method can provide valuable information about any leaks your car might have.; , This will allow time for any leaks that may be present to drip onto your material.  Note the location of any spots in relation to the car's tires. Knowing this can narrow down possible leaks.  The fluids in your car are all different. They also have different colors and textures.   If you notice light brown or black stains that are of medium consistency you are leaking oil. A few drops is normal, but anything larger should be investigated. Reddish, light brown, or black stains that are near the center of the car is usually transmission fluid. If the color is similar to the transmission fluid, but is located in the front of the car, it is your power steering fluid. Finding a pale brownish stain that is very slippery would indicate a brake fluid leak. A spot of brightly colored fluid is antifreeze. Coolant comes in a variety of colors including green, red and yellow.	Place cardboard, newspaper, or aluminum foil under your car. Allow the vehicle to sit parked overnight. Examine whatever material you put down. Inspect the color and consistency of the spots.

Mimosa pudica or sensitive plants prefer warm, sunny, indoor locations (like in a window) with temperatures between 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C).   The sensitive plant can survive outdoors in the summer (in hardiness zones 9 to 11) but it has a tendency to spread and become weedy.  The sensitive plant should be watered regularly to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Try to use loamy soil for improved drainage, as this can prevent root rot.   During growing season, fertilize the sensitive plant approximately every two weeks with a diluted high-potassium fertilizer.  The sensitive plant is not particularly prone to disease, but it may become infested with some common pests, such as red spider mites, mealy bugs and thrips. These can be removed by spraying the plant with a direct stream of water.   Avoid using insecticidal soaps, as these can turn the leaves of the plant black.	Maintain the correct temperature. Water and fertilize the plant. Prevent disease.
It will tell you if you have the option to pay the ticket online, or if you must appear in court.   Note the county in which you received the citation. A California Highway Patrol ticket is payable only to that county's court. Look out for correspondence from the county court by mail. Most counties will send you information about paying or contesting a traffic ticket. You will also be told if traffic school is an option.; , You must wait a few days for your citation number to be entered into the system, so wait at least 2 business days after you got the ticket, and at least 2 business days before it's due.   Be sure to pay by the due date. Most counties in California will not accept payment online if a traffic ticket is past due.  You will see a list of 58 counties. Click on the one where you were ticketed.   Each county has a different website, and a different way of handling online payments. A few counties, like Kings, for example, do not allow you to pay your traffic ticket online. However, most of these counties provide a number that you can call and pay your citation with a credit card.  In general, there will be a button that says "Pay a traffic ticket," or "Paying your traffic fine," or similar words.   Most have links to pay a ticket, request a court date and possibly request traffic school.  Enter your name, address, and driver's license number. Enter your citation number as listed on your ticket.  Most payments must be made by either credit card or electronic funds transfer.

Even cheap digital multimeters often have a capacitance setting "–|(–." These are good enough for basic troubleshooting, but are not typically accurate enough to rely on precise measurements. They do give accurate results for most film capacitors, since these behave more like the ideal capacitors your multimeter's calculations assume.If accuracy and precision are important, consider an LCR meter. These tools can cost several thousand US dollars, but have several reliable ways to test capacitance.   This guide focuses on multimeters. LCR meters should come with a detailed instruction manual specific to your device. ESR meters (equivalent series resistance meters) can conduct tests on capacitors while they are in a circuit, but do not measure capacitance directly.; , Turn off the power to the circuit. Confirm that the power is off by setting your meter to test for voltage. Place the leads on opposite sides of the circuit's power source. If the power was successfully shut off, the voltage should read zero.  A capacitor can hold charge for several minutes after the power is disconnected, or even longer in rare cases. Connect a resistor across the capacitor terminals so the charge can drain safely. Make sure the resistor is up to the task:For small capacitors, use (at least) a 2,000Ω resistor rated for 5 watts. Large capacitors found in appliance power supplies, camera flash circuits, and large motors can hold a dangerous or lethal amount of charge. Experienced supervision is recommended. Use a 20,000Ω, 5 watt resistor attached via 12 gauge wire rated for 600 volts.  Testing while the capacitor is part of a circuit can give very inaccurate results, and potentially damage other components. Remove the capacitor carefully, desoldering the connection if necessary.  Most digital multimeters use a symbol similar to –|(– to signify capacitance. Move the dial to that symbol. If several symbols share that spot on the dial, you may need to press a button to cycle between them until the capacitance symbol appears on the screen.If your tool has several capacitor settings, choose the range that fits your best guess for the capacitor's correct value. (You can read the capacitor's label to get a rough idea). If there is only one capacitor setting, your multimeter can automatically detect the range.  If your multimeter has a REL button, press it while the test leads are separated. This will zero out the capacitance of the test leads themselves, to avoid interfering with the measurement.This is only necessary if measuring small capacitors. On some models, this mode disables auto-ranging., Note that electrolytic capacitors (most commonly shaped like cans) are polarized, so identify the positive and negative terminals before you connect the multimeter's leads. This may not matter much for your test, but you'll certainly need to know this before using the capacitor in a circuit.Look for any of the following:A + or - next to a terminal. If one pin is longer than the other, the long pin is the positive terminal. A colored stripe next to a terminal is an unreliable marker, since different types of capacitor use different standards., The multimeter will send out a current to charge the capacitor, measure the voltage, then use the voltage to calculate the capacitance. This process can take several seconds, and the buttons and display screen may be slow to respond until it's finished.An "OL" or "overload" reading means the capacitance is too high for the multimeter to measure. Set the multimeter to a higher range if possible. This result can also mean the capacitor has shorted. An auto-ranging multimeter will test the lowest range first, then increase if it hits an overload. You may see "OL" appear on the screen multiple times before you see the final result.	Choose your tool. Shut off the power. Discharge the capacitor carefully. Disconnect the capacitor. Set the multimeter to measure capacitance. Activate REL mode if present. Connect the leads to the capacitor's terminals. Wait for the result.
These contacts should be amongst art collectors, artists and art media in the town where your gallery will open, and beyond. This can take years (5 to 15) to cultivate through art school, art jobs and socializing in a gallery or museum setting.; , In the modern marketplace, many gallerists believe you must love what you do in order to be successful. Art sales are inconsistent, with some months providing almost no income and others providing a lot.  For example, contemporary, abstract, western, sculptors, prints, furniture or a mixture of different types. The gallery's art should be varied but have a driving theme behind your artistic decisions that attracts people to be repeat customers.   You can choose to be a non-profit gallery and gather donations to run a charity. You can choose to form an artists' collective gallery, if you are an artist yourself. You can also choose to run a commercial art gallery that caters to low, middle or high price points. This should be decided before you start to look for artists or look for funding.  A business plan sets up the foundation of creating a successful, profitable business in 1 to 5 years, and it should include detailed steps on the artist plan, marketing plan and funding needed.  Your business plan, financial statements and commitment from artists will serve as ways to convince banks or business partners that you have a profitable plan. If you take on business partners, try to choose ones that are likewise linked to the art world and can send collectors your way.  Look for your artists by getting advice from other dealers or museum curators, or you can put out an open call for submissions. Negotiate your percentage in writing, understanding that generally the newer the artist is to the art world, the higher a percentage of the sale you will be able to receive.  Often this means that gallery space is expensive, so be ready to pay a high rent to stay where out-of-town visitors and collectors can easily find you. A well-situated space will also prove beneficial for marketing gallery show openings.  Gallery employees should have an art education, contacts in the art world and have sales, business or marketing experience. The ideal employee has an art history or art administration degree and is prepared to multi-task, especially at the beginning.  This is essential so that you can be protected in case of theft or other damage. Artists will often require proof of insurance before agreeing to keep their work in your gallery.  Many gallerists, especially in big cities, run their gallery along with other jobs until their gallery becomes profitable. Appoint a trusted, knowledgeable employee to oversee the gallery when you cannot be there, and work hard to move comfortably into working there full-time.  Today's galleries must have a website, social media accounts, blogs and an email list in order to be successful and get new clientele. Invest money in having an attractive website that lists your artists, some art, your location and contact information.  Use your contacts in the art world to plan, market and execute shows that are attended by your clientele. Market using email blasts, art magazine ads, newspaper features, social media and printed invitations.  You may be able to do this with software, if you are a small gallery, or you may need to hire a freelance or part-time accountant.  Booths and ad space help to establish good relationships in the art world and they expose you to new clientele. Advertising in art magazines, although expensive, may allow you to ask for monthly or annual features on your gallery shows.  Keep a list of frequent collectors who are given the first chance to buy new art or who can ask for special commissions. Also, market prints or less expensive art to visitors or younger collectors.  You never know who is or is not a collector when they walk through your door. Make sure you are not snooty, and you give a good impression to all potential clients.	Develop contacts in the art world. Be completely committed to art and your desire to start an art gallery. Decide what type of art you want to sell and who your clientele will be. Put together a detailed business plan. Look for funding, if it is not already provided. Get commitments from artists. Obtain a gallery space in a popular, or easy to find, location. Hire trusted employees. Get good insurance and a security system for your gallery. Do not quit your job immediately. Create an online presence. Host regular art gallery shows, with well-promoted openings. Create a bookkeeping system to track sales, new acquisitions and artist percentages. Consider advertising in few local and nation-wide art magazines and buying booths at fine art fairs. Be prepared to cater to 2 or more kinds of clientele. Be approachable.
Valve oil helps clean and lubricate the trumpet, which will help you play your trumpet more efficiently, and can be purchased at most music stores or at various online retailers.There are two types of oils that are recommended to use for brass instruments: synthetic-based oils and petroleum-based oils. Deciding between the two is often a matter of personal preference and determining which works better with your instrument.   Petroleum-based oil works best with brand new trumpets. Petroleum oil is lighter and won’t be as effective on worn-in trumpets. You may have to reapply this oil more often if you use it on an older instrument.Synthetic oils are typically more expensive, but they are better able to reduce friction in tighter valves. In addition, these oils do not evaporate as quickly, so you may not need to oil your valves as regularly with this type of lubricant.Try various types and brands of valve oil to see which you prefer. Each person’s experience will be different, and the oil will react differently to each person’s saliva!Be sure not to mix the synthetic oils and petroleum-based oils together.; , Some valve oils have added silicone or grease. These should be avoided. These oils can promote moisture build-up, which can cause corrosion on the trumpet’s pistons, casings, and slides.If an oil label states “shake well before use,” this could indicate that it is a silicone-based oil. Be sure to read the labels before buying a valve oil.  Using WD-40, mineral oil, olive oil, or other oils found in your home are not recommended for oiling trumpet valves. Although it may be tempting to use these since they are typically easily accessible, it is wise to wait until you can buy proper valve oil. These home-remedies can severely damage a brass instrument., To begin, you may wish to place the trumpet on a flat surface to oil the valves, or you can hold the trumpet with one hand with your fingers wrapped around the valve casing. Whether you place it on a flat surface or hold it, be sure that the trumpet is secure so that you do not drop it and cause damage to the instrument. It is recommended that you oil the valves in a quiet place where there is not a lot of activity so the instrument won’t be accidentally knocked over., Unscrew the valve cap counter-clockwise, and place it to the side where you can easily access it later. With the cap successfully removed, slide the valve upward. Be sure the valve is up far enough so that you can see it, but do not completely remove the it from the instrument. Placing valves back into the instrument can be tricky if they are fully removed. , While you have the valve partially out of the casing, place a generous amount of oil at the bottom of the valve on the shaft. Do not worry about adding too much oil to the instrument. Although some do not like to over oil their trumpet, there has been no evidence to suggest that it will damage the instrument.Just be sure that the oil does not get in the holes and inside the trumpet.The valves may seem sticky after oiling if debris collects on the oil. To fix this, gently remove the valve and wipe it with a clean cloth. Be sure to re-oil the valve before inserting it back in the trumpet., After adding the oil to the valve, gently slide the valve up and down within its casing several times. This motion will help ensure that the valve and the valve casing are both adequately coated with oil. With sufficient and even lubrication, the valve action on the trumpet will be faster and smoother, making it easier and more enjoyable to play the instrument.  Slide the valve down into the casing. Twist the valve clockwise until you hear the valve guide click back into place. After hearing the click, press the valve a few times to be sure that it works properly, is moving with easy, and that it is securely in place., With the valve securely back into place, return the valve cap and twist it clockwise so that it fits snuggly. The valve cap should be placed on the thread straight on. Make sure the cap is not at an angle while fastening it back into place. An angled cap can damage the threading and make it impossible to properly secure the cap during future oiling sessions.  Blow into the trumpet to ensure that the air is correctly blowing through the instrument. If the valves are not placed back into their casings properly, the instrument will be impossible to play. If the air is not flowing through the trumpet, then the valves have most likely been secured incorrectly. Check the valves one at a time to see that they have been properly placed back into their respective slots.  You do not need to oil the valves each time you play, but it is important to oil them 2-3 times each week or whenever the valves are not moving as efficiently as possible. This will help keep your instrument clean, improve the instrument's longevity, and help prevent corrosion. Not to mention, it will help make playing your instrument easier and more enjoyable!	Choose a valve oil. Avoid silicone-based oils. Do not use home-based oils. Position your trumpet. Oil the valves one at a time. Add drops of oil. Coat the valve with oil. Place the valve into its correct position. Replace the valve cap. Check the air flow. Oil the valves frequently.
The best time to deadhead or prune mums you are growing outside is during the late spring up to mid summer. This is right before blooming season, so the flowers have time to branch off from the cut stems. Deadheading during the warm season also makes it less likely that the vulnerable cut areas will be exposed to cold temperatures.If you are growing your mums in a greenhouse or indoors, you can deadhead them as soon as you see dead growths since the mums won’t be exposed to cold weather.; , When it’s time to deadhead your mums, inspect the plant to find the flowers or branches that are spent. Most mum blooms are orange or yellow in color when healthy, and brown when dead or dying. They also are likely drier than the other healthy flowers of the plant, often with a papery and brittle texture to their petals., If your mum plant only has a few dead blooms, you can simply pull off the browned flowers with your fingers. To do this, grip the stem of the mum right under the dead flower, then simply pinch and snap off the dead bloom.If you are growing your mum indoors or in a greenhouse, this method is probably best for you since you can continuously deadhead throughout the year and don’t have to worry about exposing your mum to cold temperatures.  If many of the blooms of your mum plant are dead, but the stalks appear to be alive and are growing buds, use a pair of garden shears to clip multiple flowers off at a time. Angle the shears right under the dead blooms and clip, taking off the blooms from a whole section of the plant. Repeat until you have taken off all the dead blooms., If most or all of the blooms and stalks on your mum plant are dead, you’ll need to use a pair of gardening shears to deadhead your plant. As soon as you see new green growth from your mum plant emerging from the ground, take a sharp pair of gardening shears and clip all of the dead sections of plant as close to the ground as you can. This will eliminate not only the dead flowers, but also the dead stems of the mum plant so that it can start anew.You may feel nervous about cutting off so much of the plant. However, if your mum is a perennial plant that went through a winter season, it’s necessary not only to cut off the flower but also the dead stems. Make sure that if you are doing a major deadheading that you do it during spring or early summer. This will give the new growths of the plant time to grow fully before blooming season in the fall.  Once your mums flower in the fall, you may be tempted to deadhead any dead flowers you see among the healthy blossoms. Resist this temptation if you are growing outdoor plants in a region that has a cold winter season, as clipping back flowers right before cold weather will leave your plant vulnerable.	Deadhead mums in late spring to mid summer. Find blooms that are wilted or dead. Pull off dead blooms with your fingers. Clip off bunches of dead flowers with shears. Shear at the bottom of the stem for major deadheading. Don’t prune outdoor mums after they flower.
These are basic, inexpensive frames made of wood for mounting a canvas. For a little more money you can purchase an aluminum frame that will last longer, as repeated washing will warp a wooden canvas.Many art stores now sell pre-made silk screens as well, so you could purchase a standard screen if you don't want to make a custom one. Ensure that your frame is big enough for your design. If you don't know your design yet, or want a versatile frame for multiple designs, aim for 12x18" at the minimum.; , You want a nice, fine mesh that allows the ink to pass onto the shirt, paper, or design. Mesh-count measures how loose or tight the mesh is, where higher numbers indicate a tighter mesh. The tighter the mesh, the more intricate your details can be. Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch.   For the classic "athletic" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count. For a "do-it-all" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count. For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250. In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts. So if you're doing white paper, aim from 230-250., Make sure you pull the screen tight before you start stapling. You want it to be as taut as possible without ripping. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple around the wood every 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm.).   You will likely need an electric staple gun to securely adhere the mesh.You can also use framing nails.	Purchase a canvas stretcher frame at a craft or art supplies store. Purchase your mesh. Staple the mesh into the frame.
You'll be needing an actual camera for this if possible. If you don't have a proper camera, a phone or an iPod will work just as well, but you will get a better picture quality from an actual camera. It doesn't have to be a big, expensive one. Just a simple digital camera will do.; , It's better to fit the background to your character (can you really imagine Sherlock Holmes taking selfies in a bathroom mirror?). If in doubt, use your back garden or a large, outdoor area as you will usually get better light outside as well as more choice of backgrounds for your shots. Good place ideas for shots include brick walls, woods, lakes, or even simple park benches.  If you own a tripod, then that would be perfect, but if not, anything from a pile of books to a window ledge will do.  You don't want to have a beautiful photo of you in costume, but the top of your head is missing. If the camera is too low or high, adjust it accordingly. Also, be sure to check whether any large props will fit within the frame of the camera - that epic scythe you made will just look like a big black stick if the blade is cropped off the top of the shot.  Something that will fit the character, for example if you are cosplaying as Naruto, perhaps make a peace sign with your fingers and pull a huge grin. If you are cosplaying as Hermione Granger, perhaps bring a book with you and pretend to read. Try to be as creative with poses as possible; many of the same poses are used time and time again but a unique idea will make your cosplay stand out even if the costume isn't 100% accurate.  About 10 seconds should do it, so you can get into position. If you have a large prop to adjust or it is hard to move in your costume then you may need more time.  Remember, you don't necessarily have to be staring straight into the camera.  Some cameras have features that let you take lots of shots in quick succession automatically. You could try setting this on your camera too, for more interesting shots.  Never use the delete button on a camera. Digital cameras don't have a recycle bin; once you delete a photo, it will be gone for good. It is safer to get rid of the ones you don't want on a computer so if you delete one by accident, you can retrieve it from the recycle bin.  Now, don't worry if you don't have Photoshop. You don't need it for minor edits. Simply left click the photo you want to edit, click 'open with' and select 'Windows Live Photo Gallery'. Once this is open, click 'Fix' in the toolbar and then edit to your hearts content. You can change the brightness, colouration and even straighten the angle of the photo. You can also fix red-eye caused by staring into the flash of the camera.	Get a camera. Choose somewhere to take the photo. Set up a stand to place your camera on. Look through the lens of your camera to see where the edges of the shot are. Choose what pose you want to do for your photo. Set the timer on your camera. Pose for the photo. Once the camera has taken the shot, you can go and look at it. Upload the pictures to your computer and delete the ones you don't care for. Time to edit!, Congratulations, you now have a wonderful cosplay photo!
You can discard the backing, but save the glass panel. You will be using it to trace the plastic canvas/mesh later.   You can use a plain frame, or an ornate one.  You can use spray paint or acrylic paint. Be sure to get the back and sides of the frame as well. Depending on how dark your frame is, or how light the paint is, you may need two coats of paint. Let the first layer dry before adding the second one., You can leave your frame plain as it is, or you can decorate it further to make it more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Glue some plastic gems or rhinestones along the frame Draw some designs on the frame using black, gold, or silver permanent marker Paint some bold designs on the frame, such as stripes, stars, or hearts Draw designs on the frame using glitter glue  , Plastic canvas looks like a plastic mesh or screen. It is stiff, and used to wave designs onto with yarn. Choose a color that matches your frame, or goes well with it.  Be sure cut along the lines, or it may fall through your frame.  Draw a line of glue all along the inside edges of the frame, where the glass panel used to rest. Quickly press the plastic canvas into the glue.   You can use hot glue or an industrial-strength (such as E6000) for this. Don't use regular school glue; it won't be strong enough.  Choose a color that matches your frame, then cut it down so that it matches your frame's width.  Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a knot. Place some glue on the back of your frame, near the top, then press the knot into the glue.   If your frame has a metal bracket for hanging, you can thread the ribbon through this bracket. You can also hang the frame from the wall using just the bracket. If you don't want to hang your earring holder, get a frame stand instead, and set the frame down onto it instead.  You can now stick earrings into the mesh. This works well with hook and post earrings. When attaching post earrings, you will need to take the back off the earring first, push the earring through the mesh, then put the back on again.	Find a wooden frame and take out the backing and glass panel. Paint the frame and let it dry. Consider decorating the frame further, especially if it is a plain frame. Use a marker to trace the glass panel onto a sheet of plastic canvas. Cut the plastic canvas/mesh out. Glue the mesh to the back of your frame.Flip your frame over so that the back is facing you. Cut a piece of ribbon. Make a loop from the ribbon, then glue it to the back of your frame. Wait for the glue to dry, then hang your earring holder.
Sit down and take a handful of deep breaths. Focus in on how the air flows through your body and how you exhale. Do you naturally inhale with your mouth? Do you automatically exhale through your nose? As you head toward a nose-centered breathing technique this will help you to identify your strengths and weaknesses., The goal is to maintain a continual, uninterrupted air supply while playing the didgeridoo. You will pull air in with your nose while simultaneously pushing air out through your mouth into the didj mouthpiece. You will also continue to drone throughout this process.With circular breathing you consider the air that you breath in and the air in your mouth as two different entities. They should both feel as if they are never empty and consistently in motion. Establishing a rhythm is important here.One of the keys is to resist blowing the air out of your mouth. That will empty your lungs and stop the drone. Instead, slowly push the air out of your mouth mimicking the same motion as you would when spitting out water., Before you are ready to hit the didj, you need to practice. Get a straw and a glass of water. Place the straw in the water and put your lips the tip of the straw. Inhale through your nose while blowing bubbles in the water. Try to keep the bubbles constant as they represent the constancy of your drone. Repeat this multiple times a day until it becomes easy.Another way to practice is to drink and hold water in your mouth until your cheeks puff out. Then, slowly spit the water out of your mouth. Inhale through your nose as you do this. Your tongue should keep you from gagging or swallowing the water. It is easy to practice this one in the shower., Without the didj, simulate your breathing movements. Breath in until your cheeks are full. Keep inhaling through your nose as you push the air out of your mouth. Be controlled in these movements., Apply your circular breathing techniques when playing the didgeridoo. Keep up the inhale/push out rhythm while maintaining your drone. Avoid incorporating any extra sounds until you have a good handle on the breathing. If your breath is holding steady, the didj will sound steady and full of air as well.You should not expect to master circular breathing right away. It is generally one of the more frustrating parts of learning to play the didgeridoo. Keep working on your breathing but recognize that you can still play the didj without holding long notes., Inhale in a controlled manner until your lungs feel full. Hold this air in for one second before exhaling slowing until your lungs feel totally drained. Pause for a second and repeat. Do this exercise for 10-15 minutes every day and you will see results.You can also improve your lung capacity by avoiding smoking and regularly exercising.	Pay attention to your current breathing patterns. Understand the mechanics of circular breathing. Practice circular breathing with water. Practice circular breathing with inflated cheeks. Find your breathing rhythm with the didj. Enhance your lung capacity.
You should be working with a standard piece of printer paper -- no need to cut it into a square. It's a good idea to start with a boring piece of regular ol' paper, make a wallet successfully, and then make another one with better paper or paper you've designed.          Once you've done that, unfold the paper so you can move on to the exciting next step.  This will create four flaps on each side. Just to make sure that's clear, it's one one-inch cut along each crease. These flaps will be used to keep the pockets together.  Fold them toward the paper, toward you. Leave the paper facing you the tall way.  They should be about 1/8" apart. In other words, you know the bottom two boxes of the page? Draw two lines right by the crease, really close to each other.  It should look like a stop sign that you're viewing from the side (the narrow diamond is the top and the two lines are the post). This will be where you can slide credit cards, business cards or cash into.          Just to be clear, your two lines go along the entirety of the bottom quarter and the diamond goes along the entirety of the second-to-last quarter.  The paper should no longer lay flat on the bottom -- that's a good thing; it means you're doing it right.  Make sure the diamond cutout is on the inside and the two flaps that you never folded in are sticking out. You should see a flap, a pocket, a flap, and a pocket, just like that, on the sides. You do, yeah?          On top of the wallet should be an opening, just like a normal wallet. If it's on the bottom, flip it over. Ha.  That's what they're there for, remember? Fold those bad boys into the pockets they're next to. Tape the flaps into the pockets to make them sturdy, if you'd like.  Use your new wallet!	Fold the paper into eighths. Make six one-inch cuts along the creases. Fold over the second and fourth flaps on each side. Draw two lines along the bottom quarter of the page, in the center. Above the lines, draw a narrow diamond in the next quarter. Cut out the design and tape the bottom quarter back together. Refold the paper into eighths. Fold the flaps into the pockets. Finished!
Find a baseball cap at the thrift store, one that fits your head well and is deep enough to sit securely.   At the dollar store, find a ring of styrofoam where the supplies for flower arranging are located.  At the hardware or discount store, get a roll of ordinary, grey duct tape.; ,,  Make them mirror images of one another, since they will go on each side of the hat.   Try different heights and angles for the horns.  Cut a 12" piece of #10 common, household wire and double it. Hold the two raw ends and push the wire through from the middle of the horn, and having it come out at the base. Repeat with the second horn. On all four raw wire ends, circle and flatten them and enclose each in duct tape.  Tape over the flattened wires encased in duct tape on either side of each horn. Criss-cross tape and flatten and mold with your fingers to make it lie flat. Use 6" Pieces of tape and spiral it around the horns, pressing and molding with your hands.  Angle and criss-cross the pieces to stabilize the horns and incorporate them onto the hat, contouring, overlapping and molding the tape to the hat and around the base of the horns.  Use a lot of pressure to flatten and contour the tape to the hat. , Lay the ball in place and cover it with another 1" piece of tape. Mimic metallic straps by using contrasting colored duct tape crossed over the front of the like a metallic band.    ,  The possibilities are endless.	Begin by assembling supplies for the helmet. Cut the brim off the hat with scissors.  , Cut two five inch pieces from the styrofoam circle and taper and round out the ends of the horns with a serrated steak knife. Test how the horns will look by holding them up to the sides of the hat using the seams in the hat as guides to get them symmetrically aligned. Run wire through each horn to attach it to the baseball hat. Tape the horns onto the hat using 3" pieces of duct tape you have torn in advance and lined up along the table's edge for easy access. Wrap the entire hat, horns and all, with 12" pieces of duct tape. Trim the hat with fur by hot gluing a strip cut from an old hat around the entire opening of the helmet.    , For rivets, use scrunched up 1" pieces of tape. Look up Viking head dress or Viking helmet for ideas on how to finish and embellish the helmet.
If you've never played before, consider your level of dedication and whether you plan on sticking it out for the long run. If you're just curious about the saxophone, then renting one from a reputable music store is cheaper and will ensure that it is in good working condition.However, long-term rental fees can become incredibly expensive, and the condition of a rented saxophone will be worse than buying a new one.The price of a new saxophone can range from $300 to over $3,000.If you are just starting off with the saxophone, buy a beginner sax that's less expensive before investing in a high-quality sax.; , An alto or tenor sax are the best options for someone who is new to the saxophone. Alto saxophones are usually the starting point for most beginners because they require less air than the tenor, and have a smaller key scale which makes them easier to handle for young adults or children.Tenor saxophones are the most closely associated with jazz music. The majority of classic music is written for the alto sax., A damaged saxophone won't produce a good sound and may cost you a lot of money in repairs. Make sure that you choose a reputable music store or saxophone shop in your area when you are looking to buy or rent. Avoid off-brand saxophones because you may have a hard time finding someone who can repair it in the future.   Some reputable brands include Keilwerth, Yamaha, Selmer, and Guardala.If you are still unsure about the brand, reach out to the music store and inquire about brands in your budget. If you are purchasing a sax online, make sure there is a return policy or warranty.  Other accessories that you'll need are a hard saxophone case, neck strap, extra reeds, cork grease, and music stand.The neck strap supports your horn and keeps it close to your body as you play. Reeds are necessary and can break easily, so it's a good idea to pick up extras. Cork grease is used to help move your mouthpiece on your sax, which will affect its pitch.Finally, the music stand enables you to sit sheet music upright, which is critical when playing a song.   Music stores will often offer a beginner saxophone with all the accessories included. Ask the salesperson if they offer these types of packages.	Decide if you want to buy or rent your sax. Determine what kind of saxophone you want. Purchase or rent a well-known brand from a reputable music store. Buy the accessories you'll need to play.
This recipe is very popular in Latin America and makes useful clay. Many recipes call for 10% formaldehyde or formalin but this has been replaced with white vinegar in this recipe for a safer, non-toxic version., First mix 1 cup cornstarch with ½ cup water in a Teflon-coated pot over low heat until it is completely dissolved. Once the cornstarch has dissolved, add and mix in the 1 cup glue.  Add 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of glycerin, 1.5 tablespoons cold cream with lanolin and 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) white vinegar to the pot. Continue cooking on low heat while stirring constantly until a dough forms and begins to come away from the sides of the pot.   Be very careful not to overcook or else the dough will harden. Glycerin is a common baking ingredient that you should be able to find in the baking section of the supermarket. Find cold cream with lanolin in the cosmetics section of the store.  Allow the dough to cool with a damp cloth used as covering. Once you can handle the dough knead it into a smooth clay consistency. It is ready to be molded however you wish.   Allow your creation to dry for at least three days in the air. Oil paints and acrylics can be used to paint your creation once you have allowed it to dry.  Store in plastic wrap and keep in a cool, dark place.	Use this method for a traditional-style recipe from Latin America. Mix the cornstarch, water and glue into a Teflon-coated pot. Add the glycerin, cold cream and vinegar to the pot and mix. Knead the dough with lotion on your hands. Store in plastic wrap.
Also look at magazines, pamphlets, the packaging of products from the supermarket etc.; , With this method, even if the title and artwork were smaller, you would still align it to the left (the spine side).  This style is harder to do and you will have to use a ruler and pencil. With the pencil, make the initial lettering of the title, and if you are satisfied, go over it with a round tip, black marker pen.  To balance it, place the artwork to the left. The artwork can also be placed in the center.  You will need an inspiration for your artwork, choose a picture to draw that relates to the title. Search the dictionary, the internet, the yellow pages etc for something to draw under the title.  From the photo, the words "cover design" can be replaced with the author's name, the book publisher, the book edition, etc. This simple book cover design required, in materials, just a ruler and a marker pen.  With the title printed on white paper, you will have a lot of contrast as a bonus. Print the artwork from the internet, use a photo, or cut out artwork from the newspaper, magazine, yellow pages etc. Printing your artwork with black ink on white paper will also have great contrast. Choose and print the artwork first, later adjust the size of the lettering of the title, so that it will be in harmony with the picture. Black is always a good choice for the color of the lettering. Make a simpler artwork such as an anchor instead of the ship. Technically make the lettering precise. Artistically, make your cover pleasing to look at. Use a multi-colored scheme for the title. Instead of artwork, use a photo or a picture from the internet, of the actual book cover. In this photo, the title was not cut perfectly and by framing it the uneven cutting would not be visible. Frame the title also with a marker pen and a straight edge.  Protect your book cover by covering it with clear, mailing tape such as in the previous photo. The contents of your textbook are more important than the cover, study hard!	Look at books on the internet, at the bookstore or at the library for some ideas on how to design a book cover. The simplest method is to align the title and the artwork to the left edge of the book. A common style of alignment is where the title and artwork is centered. For an interesting placement of the title, place it on the right side. Simplify the design from the examples and design a simple book cover. Use a round tip, black marker pen to draw. Try other ideas, if you do not want to letter the title or draw the picture:   Print the title and use a font such as Times New Roman. Finally, in the design process, take your time and enjoy the process.
When harvesting corn for seed purposes, the corn is usually ready to harvest four to six weeks after you would harvest it to eat.  The husks should be brown, dry, and papery before you harvest the corn. The stalk does not have to be fully brown yet, however.       Note that any corn harvested for seed must first be pollinated.  As with corn harvested for eating or for popcorn, the process for removing the ears off the stalk is quite simple. Hold the stalk with one hand while twisting the ear off with your other hand. You should be able to remove the ear easily by bending it down and twisting it side to side.   Shears or other garden tools should not be needed.  Pull the husks back to expose the kernels underneath. Store the corn in a cool, dry location until the kernels are completely dry.Place the corn in mesh bags and hang them in a dry, cool area for a month or two. Check the corn periodically through this stage starting at the third week. After you check the first time, check the corn once or twice a week until it is ready.       You can check the corn by twisting off a few kernels. Place the kernels in a small plastic container or bag and seal it. Put the container in the refrigerator and watch it for a day or two, noting whether or not any condensation forms. If condensation forms, the corn is not yet dry enough. If none forms, the kernels are dry and ready for shelling.  When the corn has dried sufficiently, grab the ear in both hands and twist them firmly yet carefully. The kernels should drop off without much effort.  Any silk or chaff that remains should be filtered out before it drops into the container.       Clean shelled kernels by rinsing them. Place the on top of a screen with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) gaps, placed on top of a screen with 1/4 inch (0.625 cm).Dry completely after cleaning the corn.  Place the dried kernels in an airtight container. Seal and store in a dry, dark, and cool location until you plan to plant them.  When stored under the right conditions, corn seed can stay usable for five to ten years.	Harvest a month after the eating stage. Twist or snap the corn off the stalk. Dry as needed. Twist the kernels off. Save the seed in dry containers.
The following are general equivalents between compact fluorescent light bulbs and incandescent light bulbs.   5W CFL = 25W Incandescent. 9-11W CFL = 40W Incandescent 13W CFL = 60W Incandescent 19-20W CFL = 75W Incandescent 23-27W CFL = 100W Incandescent 32W CFL = 135W Incandescent 42W CFL = 150W Incandescent	Without going into too much detail - wattage equivalents are based on similar lumen output which is the brightness of your light bulb.
Do not attempt to rock out while zooming down the Autobahn at top speeds. Intense jamming can be very distracting and endanger the lives of others if done incorrectly.   Remove all uncovered liquids from the rocking out area. Hot coffee on your lap is not a good look on anyone. Only rock out when stuck in a traffic jam, on the open road, or at a stop light. Driving should be your first priority, rocking out your second. True, this makes for less than ideal rocking out conditions, but sometimes it just has to do.  If a song comes on the radio and you find yourself squealing, let your inner rocker come alive.   If you're in a residential area, roll up your windows. Babies are trying to sleep! If you run into the cops, you could be charged with disturbing the peace.  If you're on the open road, roll 'em down and feel that breeze in your hair. Feel it? That's the freedom to rock out. Be grateful. Not everybody lives a life of such rocking privilege.  Just because you're in a car does not mean your skills should be compromised.   Your steering wheel is your drum and your seatbelt is your guitar strap. The road is your home. Go ahead! Punch, headbang, shimmy, and grit your teeth.  Do these things with your eyes open. At all times. Keep your eyes on the road. Rocking out in a car requires the art of multitasking. Always put safe driving first.	Put safety first. Pump up the volume. Utilize your surroundings.
If you have all wheel or four-wheel drive, you should make sure it is activated before you try to drive your car out of the snow. Ultimately, the more tires that can spin, the more traction your car will have and the easier it will be to move out of the snow., Instead of just switching your car into drive, make sure to put it into the lowest gear. Putting it in the lowest gear will provide your tires with more power and make sure they spin slower. This will lower the risk that your tires dig a deeper hole into the snow., Turn the steering wheel so your front wheels are as straight as possible. By straightening your wheels, you’ll make it a lot easier to get your car out of the snow. However, make sure to adjust for any obstacles – like fire hydrants or signs – that might be in front of you., Slowly back your car up. If you move a few inches, you’re making progress. Then, drive the card forward. Once again, even a few inches is progress. Continue to do this until you’re in a rocking motion. With a little luck, you’ll make more-and-more progress forward and will be able to get out of the snow.   If rocking the car out doesn't work after about 5 minutes, stop doing it. It could damage your transmission., Because your wheels may be spinning too fast or at an unequal pace, you should press the brakes slightly as you try to rock the car out. This will make it so all your wheels are working to move you out of the snow.   Don’t ride the brakes for too long. If you do this, they could overheat., Take your index finger and slightly push the pin in the center of the tire's air valve to the side. Release air until you can push the wall of the tire in just a little bit. This shouldn't take more than 20 to 30 seconds.   If your tires are completely inflated or even overinflated, this will help your tires to get better traction. If your tires are already low, don’t let any air out. If you don’t have any way to re-inflate the tires, don’t let too much air out., If your tires spin and you’re not making backward or forward progress, you should stop the car immediately. This is because tires will slowly be digging themselves deeper into the snow.	Turn your all-wheel drive on, if you have it. Put your car in the lowest gear. Straighten your wheels. Rock the car out. Ride your brakes. Release a little air from your tires, if you can't get out by rocking the car. Avoid spinning your tires.
While you should choose a color you'll want to wear, you should also keep texture in mind. Make sure the yarn is comfortable and easy to work. Buy several skeins of yarn that all have the same dye lot or you might notice subtle color variations between the skeins.   Remember that the thicker the yarn, the warmer the leg warmers will be. You can certainly use thinner yarn, just be aware that they won't be as cozy as the ones made with bulkier yarn.; , This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen. The yarn package should give a suggested hook size for use with that specific yarn.   The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose.  These are usually about 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches (10.2 cm) and feature the same stitches you'll be using in the pattern itself. If you're holding the yarn too tightly, you may need to increase your hook size. Likewise, if your stitches are too loose, a smaller hook may be needed.  Note where you'd like them to fit on your leg, then measure that length. You'll essentially be crocheting one large rectangle before joining it together. The longest part of that rectangle should match the length you'd like for your leg warmers.  Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook., You can do more or fewer stitches in order to end up with a length of chain as long as you'd like your leg warmers to be. For an adult leg warmer, you'll probably create a chain about 11–15 inches (27.9–38.1 cm) long. Write down the number of chain stitches so you can make the next leg warmer the same length.   To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain., Do this for 10 stitches. You can then place a stitch marker, if you want a visual cue alerting you to single crochet.   To make a single crochet stitch, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches.    Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row.    To half-double crochet, yarn over your hook once and skip the first 2 stitches on your row. Insert your hook into the center of the third stitch. Yarn over one and then pull all 3 stitches through the chain. You'll have 3 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull the 3 stitches on your hook., Remember that chain 1 doesn't count as a stitch when in single crochet.,,,, Continue working across into the back loops, repeating till you get to your desired length.  You'll know it's time to stop when the leg warmer is wide enough to fit around your leg. After the last stitch of the row, cut the yarn, leaving an 11–15 inch (27.9–38.1 cm) end. Bring the hook straight up and pull the cut end of the yarn completely through the stitch., You should be using a whip stitch to join them, going through each stitch from the front to the back and repeating all the way down the leg warmer.,	Select your yarn. Pick your crochet hook. Create a small practice swatch to check your tension. Determine how long you want your leg warmers to be. Make a slipknot. Chain 100 single crochet stitches. Single crochet going into the second row. Chain 1 stitch, then turn. Do half-double crochet stitches across until you reach your last 10 stitches, then single crochet those last ten. Chain 1, then turn. Single crochet into the back loops only of the first 10 single crochet stitches.  , Do half-double crochet into the back loops only till you reach the last ten single crochet stitches.  , Change to single crochet stitches into the back loops only for the last 10 stitches.  , Chain 1, then turn. Stop crocheting and fasten off. Use the darning or yarn needle to sew both sides of the single crocheted edges together using the yard tail. Make another identical leg warmer using the above steps and then you're finished.

Using sheepskin or cotton washing mitts, wash the car with a car wash soap formulated for antique cars. Rinse the car and dry with a soft cloth. Apply wax according to product directions., You will need to change the oil in a classic car about every 2,000 miles.

You'll need this container to be large enough so that when it is filled with water your terra cotta pot will be completely submerged. Soaking the pot in water will make it less brittle, and allow you to shape the breaks in it with greater precision.   Depending on your pot, your soak time will vary. Thicker pots may need to be soaked for a few hours. Thinner pots will likely only need a 30 minutes to an hour soak., Remove your pot from the water filled container. Much like perforated paper is easier to tear cleanly, you'll be drilling holes to guide where your pot will break. Use your craft or power drill and a drill bit to drill holes ½-inch apart along your planned break-line.You may want to use a piece of chalk to outline where you plan on breaking your pot. This way, you can follow the outline when drilling. For terra cotta that's especially thick or sturdy, you may want to drill your holes with only ¼-inch separating each hole. You can create breaks in your terra cotta pot in any shape you desire. For example, you might make a V-shaped break from the mouth of your pot down to the bottom, or you might try to make a diamond shape.  Before breaking your pot, put on safety glasses to protect your eyes. Hit your terra cotta pot to the inside of your break-line with your hammer. Use firm, medium force strikes. Your pot should break along the break-line. Try to break your pot so that you have at least one large potsherd.Try to create few smaller pieces of potsherd along with the large one. Smaller pieces, stacked ascending on sloping soil, will give the appearance of tiny stairways, with each small potsherd forming a single step. If your pot broke so that there is only one big piece, take your drill and drill holes to create a break-line to remove the upper left or right corner from your largest potsherd. Hit the potsherd with your hammer so that it breaks the corner piece off. It is not necessary to remove a corner piece from your largest potsherd. However, doing so will allow you to stack small potsherds on soil sloping up to the corner gap. This will create a "stairway" up through the gap that leads to the central, unbroken part of the pot.	Fill a bucket or container with water. Drill guide holes in the outline of your break. Break the pot with your hammer.
This means you should be nearly complete with the application and be able to provide the supplementary materials to the letter writer for reference. This may include:   Copy of your transcript Writing sample or portfolio of work Statement of purpose or cover letter Curriculum Vitae or resume Name of the institution Degree or fellowship program applying for Name of the contact at the institution receiving the letter Address and dates for sending the letter Any necessary letter forms, prompts, or the URL to complete and upload the letter  , Tell the most desirable candidates on your list that you hope to use them as a reference, in person if possible. Inform them of the general guidelines, due dates, and provide them with the necessary resources at this time.  Ask directly whether or not they're willing to write you a positive letter of recommendation. If not, or they're unsure of whether or not they'll have time to complete it, move to other candidates on your list.  Professors and academic advisors are generally happy to provide recommendations and consider doing so part of their professional responsibilities. However, because of the sheer volume of requests they receive, you should be sure to request the letter of recommendation well in advance of any admissions application or other deadlines.   A good rule of thumb is making first contact a semester ahead of time to gauge their willingness to write a letter, and then making sure they have all materials at least a month or two before the deadline.  Thank your references for providing letters with a note or phone call. Also, it's a good idea to keep them updated on your progress. They have a stake in your success, so let them know if you've been offered a spot at the university or program. This will also keep the door open if you need more letters somewhere down the road.	Collect all the information about both the institution and the application to provide to your letter writers. Make contact. Gauge their willingness. Be timely. Follow up and keep in touch.

Once your stalks are at least 12 inches tall and the stems are ½ an inch thick, they are ready to harvest! There are a few different ways you can choose to do so.   Grab the stalk firmly down at the base nearest to the ground, and pull quickly. The stalk should be removed fully and cleanly. If you live in a warm climate and would like the stalks to grow back next year, cut the stalks about an inch from the ground. Be sure to use a sharp knife as the plant can sometimes be hard to cut, but be aware that it may dull your blade. Once your stalks are harvested, cut the leaves from the stem using a knife. Both portions of the plant can be used for different purposes, so be sure to save both!  , Peel away the outer layers of the stem to expose the soft white insides, or the heart, which is the most flavorful part of the stalk. You can mince or puree the soft heart inside, and use them in many ways for flavoring food.Rice, salad, and sauces are a popular option for this herb, and you can also add the pureed stalk to smoothies. In its rawest form, the lemongrass will help ease muscle pain, and aid in digestion.Store the stems by freezing them in a plastic bag, which will help keep them fresh for a few months.  The leaves are most flavorful when raw, however, they can still pack a punch when dried.   Fresh lemongrass can be steeped in tea, used to create soaps, salves, or other lemony scrubs! If you’d like to dry your lemongrass, start by bundling them up with string, and hanging them upside down in a dark place. Dried lemongrass leaves can be added to soups, sauces, or any other dish. Dried lemongrass leaves also help keep away insects, so put them along the ground outside your house to keep out any unwanted visitors!Store any unused dried lemongrass leaves in an airtight jar or container, they will stay fresh for up to a year.	Pull the stalks from the ground. Use the stems. Use the leaves.
Look for a sparsely populated area on the wall for your framed vase.; , You could mount a picture frame directly on the wall and then float the vase in the middle or you could purchase a framed picture, remove the glass and mount the vase in the middle.  What kind of expression are you hoping to make with your artwork and what kind of flowers and color will compliment your style.  Not only should you take size into account, you should also consider actual shape. For the most part, a rectangular vase or a vase with a flat back works well in terms of mounting.  Pick up frame, vase, flowers and paint. You will also need a picture hanging kit for the frame.  Make sure the spray mount is compatible for mounting glass objects.	Identify an area that you plan to add your masterpiece. Determine how you will assemble your framed piece. Search for flowers or contents to fill your vase. Consider what kind of vase will work best. Visit the craft store and purchase supplies. Hit the hardware store to purchase heavy duty spray mount adhesive.
Lift one knee, then the other. Increase the speed to elevate your heart rate, and lift your knees higher to increase the stretch.          Keep your landing soft to avoid knee injuries. Continue until your breathing is effected. This will increase your oxygen intake as you inhale more deeply and frequently. Increasing your blood flow by getting your heart rate up will prepare your muscles for both stretching and dancing.; , Extend both arms out to the side. Slowly move both arms in a forward circular motion. Start by making small circles, then increase the distance of your swing as you go so you are extending your arms further toward the ceiling and the floor.         Swing your arms forward for 20-30 seconds, then slowly bring the circles to a stop and rest your arms at your sides. Repeat this exercise swinging your arms backward.  From a standing position, plant your feet shoulder width apart and relax your arms at your sides. Rotate your upper body to the left. This should include your head, neck, shoulders and spine. Keep your hips facing squarely forward and don't allow them to move. Swing your arms sideways across your body as you twist above your torso. Twist back past center and on the right side.         Relax your shoulders. Your arms should be free to swing back and forth. Twist left and right for 20-30 seconds  , Swing your torso to the left and and right. Relax your arms and allow them to sway like the trunk of an elephant.         Continue for 20-30 seconds. Avoid bending too far or having your knees cross over the extension of your toes.  Dynamic stretching could include lunging through downward facing dog to prepare for the movements required for dancing.This is more controlled than ballistic stretching, but moves through the range of motion and prepares the body for the requirements involved in the dance.Lunge forward by stepping one leg in front of you with the knee bent. Do not let your bent knee extend beyond your toe. Place your hands on the floor on either side of your bent knee with palms flat. Extend your bent leg back to meet your straight leg, but keep your feet should width apart. You should now be in a plank position. From this position, lift your hips and pull them back toward your toward your feet with your heels pressing toward the floor, putting you in a pike position.          Hold the pike position for 15-20 seconds. For an extended stretch, lift and extend one leg behind you. Point and flex your toe, then replace your foot and repeat this motion with the other leg. Another option is pressing one heel into the ground while slightly bending the opposite knee, then switching to pressing the opposite heel to the ground. This will give an additional stretch to your calves. Slowly roll your spine back to standing, and repeat this entire process by stepping forward into a lunge with the opposite foot. Repeat this entire process 6-8 times.	Jog in place. Swing your arms in circles. Move on to an active, standing spinal twist. Add knee bends.From a standing position, bend at the hips, reaching your hands toward the ground and gently bounce at the knees. Include dynamic stretching.
Put on some OutKast, some lil john, Kanye West, or anybody else who makes your feet want to move on their own. Also try dub step, if you want to challenge yourself!   Feel the beat. You want to be engulfed in the music, so turn it up high enough that you feel every whomp of the kick drum and every thump of the bass.; , You want your clothes to be loose and comfortable when you're practicing. When you hit the clubs, you may be wearing tighter and less comfortable clothing, but it's good to practice with as much comfort as possible.   Wear shoes that do not grip the floor too hard. You want to be able to slip and spin easily, and if your soles catch on the ground on a fast move, you could fall down, or even twist an ankle.  You don't want to look stiff when you're dancing hip hop. Look relaxed, with your body comfortable instead of standing up too tall or looking like your head and neck are too stiff. Once your body is relaxed, you're free to move however you want to the beat. If you're too nervous about it, you won't be able to fully let go.  This is a safe bet for when you're starting to dance to hip hop music. This neutral position will make it easy for you to try any dance move you want to try. Your knees should be slightly bent, which will make it easier for you to dance and will keep you from looking too stiff or formal.  Don't cross your arms over your chest or fidget with your hands. Just keep your arms and hands nice and loose at your sides, staying relaxed as you start to move to the music.  When you're dancing hip hop, it's important to get your hips into it. You'll need to move those hips to the right, to the left, to the front, or to the back along with the flow of the music. This can be one of the first things you do as you're getting ready to bust out some killer moves.  You don't have to follow how other people dance, but know the moves. There's no set way to dance to hip hop music. Your best bet is to relax, move your hips, and to find whatever dance moves feel right to you. You can steal elements of popular dances or make up your own, and mix and match between different moves as much as you like. See the next section to get inspired to do a variety of dance moves.   Remember, it doesn't matter if you look like you know what you're doing. If you act confident and like you do know what's what, then people will have faith in your hip hop dancing skills.  Learning the whole "My Dougie" dance can be helpful in a pinch, if the song comes on, but knowing the main moves in the dance, which require you to move your arms and shoulders from left to right, can also add a nice touch to your dance moves, because you can incorporate a move from this dance into your hip hop moves at any time. You don't have to do the whole dance -- you can just do it for a few seconds before you transition into another move.  This is another fun dance move that makes it look as if one of your legs doesn't work properly -- hence, the term "stanky." Though these moves are part of a dance, you can just do the stanky leg any time. All you've got to do is stick one foot out and lean in the opposite direction, moving the foot that's out in a way that makes it look "stuck" or stanky. After a few seconds, you can move to the other side and repeat the move with the other leg.  Body popping is another classic hip-hop move where you isolate one part of your body at a time, making it "pop". You can pop your arms, your shoulders, your chest, or any other part of your body while you're on the dance floor. This is a great move that you can use from time to time without putting too much emphasis on it.  The Helicopter is a classic break dance move where you squat down on the ground with your hands on the floor and move one leg all the way around your body. To pull this off, you'll have to lift your hands and jump just at the right time, so your feet don't run in to your hands and other leg. This is a great move to do on the dance floor, especially if you're dancing in a circle.  This dance move looks just like it sounds. First, you pop one part of your body. Then, you lock it all into place. After that, you get low and drop it, with your feet wide. You can do this any time in the middle of any dance move.  You can learn to do the basic T-step, master the Running Man, or even bring these moves together. The shuffle is a classic move that requires you to have good coordination and nimble feet. If you know how to do it, you'll look like a pro on the dance floor in no time.  This dance move requires you to bend your knees, move your arms up and down, and cross them behind you. Elements of this dance can be perfect for any hip hop beat.  Michael Jackson would be proud if he saw you out on the dance floor, busting out his classic move in the middle of a song. All you have to do is master the footwork, making it look like you're moving forward when you're really moving backward. This classic dance move can be done in the middle of any song, even if you only do it for a few seconds.  Don't be afraid to do this. Although many people are nervous to pull it off, through the years it has become a very universally used hip hop move. If Big Freedia can do it, so can you -- all you've got to do is get comfortable, lean forward, and shake what you've got up and down. Shake from the hips, not the legs. If you really aren't comfortable, it's alright. Hip hop isn't just about twerking.  Hip hop music is made for grinding. Don't be afraid to grab a partner, sync hips, and grind facing each other and away from each other. If you're not comfortable getting so cozy, you can still keep your distance and have a great time dancing to the music.  MTV, YouTube, and the internet are all loaded with great music and videos from people of all skill levels. Whether the talent on those videos are world-class poppers or suburban housewives doesn’t matter—–what matters is you watch their moves. Copy what you can, be inspired by what you can’t.   Watch a friend rehearse his or her routine, then practice his or her basic routine. Learn the same stunts and practice the whole routine over again adding the stunts. Then add your own style.  If you’ve gone far enough on your own, and think you have it, get some lessons. Many dance or even yoga studios offer hip hop dance classes.   Find an inspirational dancer in your neighborhood and ask if he or she gives lessons. If you don't have the money to take hip hop classes you can learn how to do hip hop through YouTube. This is a cheap way to take hip hop dance without paying for classes.       Check at your local gym. Hip hop dancing is a great way to stay in shape, and it’s fun, too.  Some people are born to dance. Some have to work at it. It doesn’t matter what group you’re in, what matters is that you work it, and you put yourself into it all the way.   Practice on your own. Dance alone in a room where nobody one can see you, and you won’t worry about what others are thinking—just getting your body comfortable with the beat. Just let your body flow to your own rhythm!

; , This is the most commonly used technique. It is also the simplest. The illustration indicates its form.  This is an effective weave on large surfaces, and in bands or patterns of the same or a contrasting colour on plain rattan baskets.  Two weavers are started behind two succeeding spokes, and crossed between them, so that what was the under weaver becomes the upper weaver each time.  Here, three weavers are placed behind three consecutive spokes, starting with the back one, over two and under one spoke, each on its way to the back of the third spoke being laid over the other two weavers. In turning up the sides of large baskets where separate spokes or additional spokes have been inserted, or as a strong top for scrap baskets, this weave is invaluable.	Start by understanding some basic terms:    Weaver - these are the basket strands that weave through the spokes; they are lighter, thinner and more flexible than the spokes, to enable them to be woven in and out;  Spoke - these are the strands that stand upright and form the side supports of the basket; they are much stiffer than the weavers and are strong. Be familiar with under-and-over-weaving. Note that double weaving is the same form but two weavers are used at once. Note that pairing may be used with an odd or even number of spokes. Identify the triple twist.
Choose one that your child or you would like to have on the window. Print it out. Of course, if you have a picture already, you can use that instead, provided it's on plain white paper.  Only use crayons, as pencils, pens or markers will not work to create the stained glass window effect., Put your now colored picture on top of the newspaper, making sure that the backside is facing up., Pour a little cooking oil into a bowl. Dip one end of the sponge into the oil. Gently brush the back of the picture with the oil; it will start to seep through the paper, turning it transparent. You should be able to see the picture on the other side.  Don't miss out any bits of the image or paper––if you do, it will stop the light coming through the missed parts.  Once it has dried, you can stick it on your window to let the light shine through.	Look up a nice picture on the internet. Color in the nice picture using any wax crayons. Lay newspaper on your work table. Get a sponge. Leave the picture to dry for about 2 to 3 days.
Use your Torx driver to remove these.   After you lift up the inner panel, the door latch mechanism should be exposed. You are going to need to separate the electrical connections from the switch, so use a screwdriver to pry them off. Be gentle to avoid damaging these components.; ,, With a flat screwdriver, pry off one end while you simultaneously lift the handle.    Two pivot points should be free at this point. Slide the handle forward, then lift the handle away from the dishwasher.    All you'll need to do is slide both of the two inner pivot points mentioned earlier. Fortunately, both of these points have been tapered, which makes the reattachment process a breeze.  At this point, you can simply turn the latch in place so that it's facing down and then snap it at one of its sides with the use of the tapered pivot. This should allow the other side to slide in without any trouble. Make sure to note that this latch will remain in its locked position until you eventually re-install it in the dishwasher.  You can easily find these by lifting up the door. There is plenty inside the dishwasher to push against the wires, so make sure they're not touching anything.  Put it in place and set the handle through the slot on the door.   Put all eleven screws back on, then open the door to make sure that handle is working as it should. Turning on the dishwasher is the final test because a disconnected latch will actually prevent the dishwasher from starting at all. As long as both of your tests work out, you've successfully fixed your dishwasher's door latch.	Look around the edge of the inner door panel to find eleven screws. Use a screwdriver to latch the small cam of the handle by pressing on it.  , Take the handle off. Lift one side of the handle and push it toward the other end as you pry it away from the door latch gently. Transfer the dishwasher handle to the new latch without any problems. Take hold of the handle and pull it up until you can see that it has locked into place completely. Use the wire harnesses to stabilize the dishwasher's electrical wires. Perform a final check of the latch before you start putting the screws back on the inner panel.
Cashmere is a wool, but it's not just any wool. Cashmere is obtained from a goat of the same name, but only the soft, ultra-fine undercoat is used for textile manufacturing purposes. Because of the extreme environments these goats live in, their undercoat is especially valued for being a great insulator, its durability, and longevity. Cashmere is incredibly soft and lightweight.Good, expensive cashmere hairs will be between 3 to 4 centimeters long each.Cashmere fibers are so thin and lightweight that they weigh 10 times less than other kinds of wool.; , Large department stores and famous retailers have laboratories where they test all of the wool items they receive for authenticity and quality.Because of this, you can know that even before you perform your own test, someone in quality control has also already tested the fabric to be sure of its authenticity. Multiple checks, however, are a good thing, on the off-chance an inspector missed something.   While it might seem tempting to buy locally while traveling in a foreign country where cashmere goods are produced to help support local people, there are also large profits to be made off of tricking an unknowledgeable consumer into buying inferior goods.If you're particularly dead-set in purchasing a particular blanket you've found at a small store or from a local merchant, you can check the quality of the cashmere by administering a few physical tests and evaluating the fabric.  Although it's possible that you might find a good deal online, you will want to, if at all possible, go into a store and actually interact with the product in-person. Several of the best tests to determine the quality of the fibers used can only be done by-hand. If you found a bargain online and are dead-set on making that purchase, try to find a local retailer carrying the exact same item; many department stores and home goods stores will carry similar if not identical stock in their stores.  When you look at the fabric under the light, does it appear shiny like satin? Good cashmere should not. You also don't want to see excessive amounts of light coming through the holes in the weave: a good blanket will be tightly knit, and the light-weighted quality will be an inherent property of the material itself., Pilling is a process that happens overtime due to abrasion. The fibers unravel, resulting in the balled up ends "pilling" on the surface of the fabric. Although fabrics made of short, man-made fibers like acrylic, nylon, and polyester are the worst culprits, wool can also pill. Pilling will not only ruin the soft, natural texture of your blanket and its thickness, but, especially on knitted materials, it can also look unsightly.   Longer fibers will pill less and are thus considered higher quality. Give the surface of the blanket a gentle rub with your hand; watch to see if any fibers start to roll up or shed off of the blanket. Avoid a product that indicates it will shed or pill a lot in the future.  Mohair, alpaca, angora, and camel are all other fine, luxury wools, but cashmere is still known to be the softest.If you can, find another of these wool products in the store, or perhaps bring something from home made from made of a soft wool, and compare the textures with your fingers. If the cashmere blanket is not softer, then that should bring into question the quality of the fibers.  A properly made blanket should not fall apart instantly: rather, it should feature a tight enough weave that it will spring back and retain its shape.See what happens when you tug on the blanket: does it start to lose its shape? If it's properly constructed, it should return more or less to its original appearance.  This is not a test that you can administer easily in your average store: trying to do so before you have purchased the item may get you into legal trouble, and doing it after you buy the item could invalidate your ability to return it. However, in situations where you might be trying to purchase an item as a tourist in a small village, you could ask to administer a burn test to a single fiber taken from the blanket you want to purchase by using a cigarette lighter.   Watch to see how fast it lights on fire: oil-based products (typically used in man-made synthetic fibers) are particularly susceptible to fire. If the strand produces a strong, plasticity odor while or after having been burnt, this is a strong indicator that at least a percentage of the fibers are synthetic. After blowing out the fire on the end of the strand, look at the end to see if it has distorted into a ball shape, with a hard plastic feel. There will be no ash, and you will be unable to make the fiber crumble between your fingers. This is another indicator of synthetic fibers. If the fiber has a natural burnt smell after burning it, check it against the smell of a bit of burnt cotton fiber to be sure that they are not identical: wool and cotton produce distinct smells when burnt.	Familiarize yourself with the qualities of cashmere. Buy it from a reputable store. Evaluate it in-person. Hold the blanket up to the light. Check for pilling. Compare the texture with other wool. Check its elasticity. Burn it.
All you really need to make a Chinese paper lantern is colorful paper and some tools. Red is a traditional color, but any color will do:   Construction paper (8.5" x 11" or bigger) Scissors Pencil Ruler Stapler, tape, or glue; , This will be the accent color of your lantern, with the full-size piece used as your main color. Cut use a ruler and scissors to make the sheet an inch shorter on the length and the width.          Save these strips for later -- they can make good handles.  Fold the big, uncut construction paper in half horizontally, so that the two long edges meet. Use the hard edge of your ruler or your fingernail to make a nice even crease at the fold.  If the construction paper was a hotdog bun, you'd be cutting from the bottom up. For perfect Chinese paper lanterns, use the ruler to ensure every cut goes equally high. While there is no perfect height to get to, usually longer cuts (3-5") look best.  You don't want too much overlap. This smaller sheet becomes the form and shape of your lantern, so you want it to be large and well rounded. Staple or tape it together once you have your shape.          If in doubt, overlap the papers about a finger's width.  You're doing the same thing you did with the smaller sheet, but, this time, you use the pre-made cylinder as a guide. Take the long edge of the lantern sheet and tape it around the entire top edge of the smaller sheet.          Because it is longer, the bottom edge should overhang. Work slowly, getting the edges of the two papers lined up perfectly for the best lantern.  You should already see your lantern forming before you've even taped it. Again, go slowly for the best, most precise results.  Simply curl one of the strips from earlier in half and tape it to two places along the top of the lantern.  You'll be able to see where the paper overlaps and glues or staples together. But you can create a nice accent and avoid the issue by using two strips of paper and some glue. Matching the interior color of the lantern with these trim pieces (like in the video) is extra slick looking.	Grab two different colors of large construction paper, and a third color for the handle. Cut a 1" strip from both the long and short side of one piece of paper. Fold the larger piece of paper in half, hot dog style. Working perpendicular to the crease, cut multiple slits along the entire folded paper. Curl the smaller paper into a cylinder, touching the two shorter edges together. Tape one edge of the larger, cut paper to the top of the cylinder, wrapping it all the way around. Scrunch up the bottom of the lantern, so the cut slits point outwards, and tape the bottom edge. Tape or staple a handle to the top of the lantern. Optional -- hide the tape lines by gluing two strips of paper around the top and bottom edges of the lantern.
This will give you a good overview of the process so that you can anticipate what step comes next and what parts you will need next. Remember that while this article gives a good overview of the process of installing a garage door, there may be important steps that are specific to your manufacturer. Always assume that their instructions supersede those provided here.; , Your garage door should come with all the necessary parts included. Be sure you have all the parts listed in the instructions and that you understand where each piece provided should go once installed. Its always a good idea to organize your parts into piles, so you can see exactly what you have (and if anything is missing).   While there is some variation depending on the manufacturer, a garage door should come with panel sections, hinges that connect each section together, rollers that allow the sections to move up and down, track for the rollers to move in, brackets to connect the track to the frame of the garage, and a tension spring to help offset the weight of the door. If any parts are missing do not begin installation. Proceeding without all of the necessary parts could lead to trouble installing your garage door, damage to the door, or even injury due to a poorly installed door.  This includes a hammer, nails, power drill with a screwdriver tip, and screws. You will also need a ladder to reach the parts of the door that are overhead. In fact, it's not a bad idea to have two ladders handy, so that you and your helper can both be on one at the same time.   Have all your tools and manufacturer-provided garage door pieces at arm's length to make installation easier.  If hinges aren't already attached to the top of the first panel, attach them. Slide a roller into the left and right hinges on the panel. Also attach the manufacturer-supplied weather stripping to the first panel's bottom edge.   This is also a good time to pre-drill holes for the hinges on the rest of the sections, as it will be easier to get the sections lined up exactly when on the ground. Once you have the hinges attached to the bottom of each section, lay the panel on the ground next to its adjacent panel. Line up the sections exactly, then pre drill the holes where the two sections will be connected. This will save you the time and frustration of trying to attach the hinges while the sections are up in the opening.  Center the panel with the weather-stripping end on the ground. Make sure you have chosen a garage door that is wide enough to cover the opening but does not extend too far past that opening. Garage doors come in standard sizes, with most basic roll-up single garage doors measuring about 7 feet (2.1 m) tall and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. If your opening differs from this, you may have to order a specialty door.   If you don't have someone to help you for this part, temporarily pin the panel in place by driving nails at an angle partially into each jamb. This will allow the panel to stay put while you continue the installation process. Remember not to nail through the actual door panel, just use the nail to wedge it in place.  Each of these distinct parts should be kept separate for now, as they will be attached in separate steps, but the vertical sections should be connected to each other, if necessary.   The vertical section should be approximately as long as the door opening is tall.  Start with one side and then move to the other. Make sure each track is level and that your panel is still centered in the opening. Screw the track to the door frame with the brackets provided, but don't tighten them all the way. You may need to make several slight adjustments to their position as you add the next panels.  Unlike the first panel, the second panel should not have the outside hinges attached before the panel is put in place.   Install the outside hinges and rollers on the second panel (and subsequent panels) by angling each unattached roller into the track, then sliding the roller with hinge attached into place on the panel and securing it with screws. These holes can be pre-drilled but cannot be attached beforehand or you would not be able to get the roller in the track. Be sure to do this for both sides of the doorway. Don't forget to also pre drill the holes for the hinges connecting the second and the third panels before you install the second panel! It's much easier to do this on the ground than when its up in the door opening.  These screws can be tightened all the way once the panels are lined up exactly.  Be absolutely certain that the lag screws go into sound framing but do not completely tighten any of them yet because you still might need to adjust the tracks.   Remember to keep checking that the track is level and that the panels are lined up correctly. Any misalignment early on can cause problems for the function of the door.  Be sure that the brackets below each panel are attached to the wall. Once again, you still want to have the ability to adjust the brackets but they should be secured enough to hold the panels in place.  Secure the top plates of the vertical track to the wall on each side of the doorway. The lag screws must be driven into sound framing since the garage door will exert a great amount of force every time it goes up or down.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions when connecting the tracks together. It may prove helpful to rest the horizontal track on top of a ladder at this point. Verify that the horizontal track is level. Cut the rear track hanger to the appropriate length needed to support the track and screw the track hanger into sound framing, such as ceiling joist or blocking. Repeat this process with the other piece of horizontal track, making sure that the distance between track is the same as below.  Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you intend to use an opener, wait on installing the torque tube. The torque tube and/or spring provides lift assistance for the door and is helpful when you are opening and closing the door manually.   Make sure that if you install a garage door spring, you also install a safety cable to protect from accidents if it breaks. Garage door springs are very strong and could fly across your garage if they come loose, causing damage or possibly injury. If you have a garage door opener to install see: How to Install a Garage Door Opener   , Remember to remove any temporary nails, such as the ones you drove into the jamb at an angle across the first panel. Also make sure all obstacles, particularly ladders, are out of the way so you don't hit them when you try the door for the first time.  Tighten the screws starting at the bottom of the door and working your way up. As you go, check the operation of the door by making sure it moves freely in the track. The door should move easily up and down the track once the screws are all tightened.  Make sure the tracks are aligned and make adjustments to the position of the track as necessary. Be sure to check that all of the rollers are sitting well in the tracks and that they are moving freely. Also check that the door will stay in the up position without holding it up. If you have a problem with this, you may need to adjust the slope of your horizontal track or the garage door spring.	Read all of the manufacturer's instructions. Make an inventory of your parts. Gather all the tools and additional materials you will need for the installation. Prepare the first panel of the door for installation. Place the first panel in the doorway. Assemble the vertical, horizontal, and curved parts of the track per the manufacturer's instructions. Install the vertical track by sliding the rollers on the first panel onto the end of the track and then lowering it into place. Set the second panel on top of the first panel with the help of an assistant. Attach the first panel's hinges to the bottom of the second panel. Secure the track further up the wall, so that it is attached (but still adjustable) to the bottom of the panel just installed. Repeat the steps above when installing the additional panels of your garage door. Check that the door is level and make sure the vertical track is plumb. Install the horizontal and curved tracks. Install the provided torque tube and/or spring if you do not intend to use a garage door opener. Clean up your area. Tighten all of the fasteners once you are satisfied with the alignment of the tracks. Check the alignment of the door and that it is secured properly one final time.
Don't buy one that is too big. If you can't find one that will cover the entire trumpet bell, you can settle for a smaller one, but these will not give you as good of a sound. ,  (Optional) Take a nickel and stick it in the hole that you just cut. Make sure it is all the way in and won't come out and become lodged into your trumpet/trombone. Also make sure that you stick it in so that it's not closing up the hole, but so it is like a wall in the middle of it. This will give your plunger more of a buzzing sound.	Buy a plunger that you can set on top of your trumpet and it will cover the entire bell.Remove the handle if it has one. Use a utility knife to cut a hole where the handle of the plunger used to be.
Make sure to have all of your materials at hand: beads, beading thread, wire cutter, crimp beads, super glue, and closures to properly finish your necklace.          The best kinds of wire are flexible beading wire and beading thread. All of these materials are easily available at your local craft store (Michael's or Joanne's, for example).; , When considering which style of necklace you'd like to create, think about factors such as length. If you like shorter necklaces you might consider making a collar or choker. If you like longer necklaces, you might want a lariat length (longer, usually down to your chest) necklace.  You can also make up your own style and length. These are simple suggestions to give you a rough idea. Note that the finished length of your beaded necklace includes the beads you've used and the length of the jewelry clasp of your choice.  The collar is the shortest necklace and amounts to roughly 13 inches total length. The choker is a little longer, and goes down to about 14 to 16 inches. A Lariat is the longest, coming in at about and over 45 inches. As mentioned above, you can also choose your own length and style.  Take your tape measure, and loop it around your neck while looking at yourself in the mirror. Try small and big loops to see what you prefer. This will give you an idea of what your necklace might look like on your neck.  Play with the beads until you find the design you like best. Try different color variations, perhaps even think of having multiple layers of string. You might want a choker that wraps around your neck a few times, or maybe just one long loop.  A bead board is a tool that greatly facilitates the process of stringing beads, and improves your design skills rapidly. You can use it to measure the length of your necklace, while keeping the beads in place. If you plan on making necklaces regularly, or even occasionally, you should have a board at hand.  Place your beads in your chosen design at the number zero, and measure the length of your necklace using the numbers and dashes along the sides. Use the channels for laying out beads. The tray insets are for holding beads and findings.  For example, if you'd like to make a choker, cut a total of 22 inches of thread (16 inches plus 6).  The next part will give you tips on how to thread beads properly.  Then, slide the crimping bead in, and then add another bead about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so down. Keep in mind that you're not yet transferring your design onto the thread. These are necessary, preliminary steps that will secure your necklace.  Then, make a loop with the stringing material.  Then add the bead-crimp-bead combo, and use the crimping tool/chain nose pliers to crimp the bead into place.  If using bead thread, you may wish to put a dot of super glue of hypo cement on either end to ensure that the beads and crimp stay on.) These steps will protect the stringing material from rubbing on the ends of the crimp bead, which may cause the necklace to break.  Once you're satisfied with your design, carefully remove one bead at a time, and string it onto the thread. Be sure to leave about 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) of stringing material at the end.  Thread beads onto the stringing material until there are none left on your bead board.  Try to push the remaining stringing material into the bead holes below the crimping bead.  Be careful not to pull the stringing material too tight. Leave a small amount of slack in the necklace (2-4 mm or 1/4 inch). This leaves room for the beads to move and rotate, so they don't rub on each other or the stringing material too much. If the stringing material is too tight the necklace will be rigid and this can make the design look angular instead of slightly rounded like a necklace should be.  It is not recommended that you cut the wire too close to the crimp bead. 1 inch (2.5 cm) of wire, carefully hidden in the bead holes, is good insurance against breakage.	Gather your beading materials. Determine your necklace style. Select a length. Measure your neck, and then decide on a length. Arrange your beads on a flat surface, like a table or a desk. Place your bead board on your flat surface. Cut your determined length of beading thread, plus 6 inches. Gather 2 crimp beads, 1 clasp, and the beads for the desired necklace. Slide one bead onto the string. Place one end of the clasp (the jump ring) on after the crimping bead. Thread the end of the stringing material through the clasp section. Slide your design onto the string. Use a clasp section/ jump ring and the bead-crimp-bead combo. Crimp the second end and cut the stringing material with slush cutters. Finished.
Speeding reduces the time you have to react and increases the likelihood of you having an accident. The faster you’re going, the harder it is to slow down. When you can't slow down, you are risking the possibility of causing an accident.          Remember that police officers often stay hidden from view while looking for speeders. If you're caught driving too fast, they won't hesitate to give you a ticket. While this isn’t an accident, it’s certainly another thing you want to avoid.; , Defensive driving means letting others go ahead of you and not defending your position in traffic. Avoid the urge to be a vigilante ("Oh yeah? Let me show you what it's like to be cut off like that!") and stay away from weaving and cutting others off by sticking to your lane. Accept the fact that someone is always going to think they're in more of a hurry than you. These are the drivers you want to move far away from. Don't be tempted to “teach them a lesson” – it won't work.          In general, avoid the left lane. It’s where most accidents happen.You also have more "escape routes" in the right lane should a problem suddenly arise that requires you to quickly change lanes or pull onto the shoulder.  Two hands on the wheel allow you more control over the car if an emergency situation were to arise. Imagine having one hand leisurely resting on it when you have to swerve out of the way – you lose that precious split second in adjusting your position that could mean the difference between safety and an accident.   Keep your hands in the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions. While this isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, this position does allow you the most flexibility should you suddenly need to adjust your course., No matter how slowly traffic is moving, keep at least two seconds of following distance between you and the car ahead of you. Any less and you won't be able to stop in time if the driver in front of you slams on their brakes.          This is especially important during high traffic times. You may think the car ahead of you is speeding up significantly, when really they’re moving forward only to stop again. If you don’t tailgate, you’ll put less wear on your brakes and save gas, too. All that stopping and starting isn’t good for your vehicle.  Always use your signal, even if you think no one is there. When changing lanes on the freeway, don't signal as an afterthought or during the lane change. Signal at least a couple of seconds in advance so others know what you're going to do before you do it and can account for your actions should there be an issue.          Ever notice how most of the skid marks along the highway are just before an exit ramp? This is where you have to be the most careful.  Don't get in the habit of staring at the back of the car ahead of you. Periodically shift your eyes to the side-view mirrors, the rear-view mirror, and ahead to where you'll be in 10-15 seconds. Doing this, you can spot a potentially dangerous situation before it happens.          This can help you predict what traffic is going to do. Looking at the cars a few ahead of you will let you know whether you’ll have to soon hit the brakes or not. This will help you monitor your blind spot as well, which makes it much easier to know if the lane changes you want to make are safe.  This is a must, no matter where you are, what kind of car you're driving, or where you're driving to. By law in many countries, all cars must have a safety restraint and it must be used. Buckling up only takes a second and can save your life in an accident.          Children should always be in a booster seat or car seat until they are tall enough and heavy enough to sit by themselves. This generally includes children age eight and under.Never put a child in a car or booster seat in the front passenger seat or another seat with airbags. Children should generally be 12 and older when sitting in the front passenger seat.  Staying within the protection of the curbside lane will reduce the likelihood of a collision with oncoming traffic in two- or four-lane city streets. And instead of having traffic on both sides of your vehicle, as you have when you are in the non-curbside lane, you only have traffic on one side, which lessens the probability that another driver will hit your vehicle in one way or another., Many minor car accidents occur in parking lots, mostly when either parking or leaving the parking space. If you park in a space without vehicles in the spaces to either side of you, this potentially gives several other cars the chance to hit your vehicle while attempting to park next to it. If you park between two other vehicles, you reduce the chance that other cars will attempt to park next to yours and possibly hit it., Pull over if you need to talk on the phone, read directions, eat a snack, or mess with your iPod or CD player. It only takes a second or two of distraction to get into trouble, to miss that obstacle in the middle of the road or the car in front of you coming to a jarring halt. The last thing you want is your mind and hands busy when an emergency situation arises.      This is important to keep yourself accountable, but it's also important to keep away from others that aren't so careful. Giving driving 100% of your concentration will help you avoid the drivers that are texting, eating, or not really paying active attention.  Most accidents happen at night or in the wee hours of the morning. Here’s why:It is more difficult to see, regardless of the weather. You and other drivers are more tired. Your reaction times are slower, making driving overall more dangerous. You will have the greatest chance of meeting up with a drunk driver at night.  If your eyes are on your phone or your thoughts are anywhere else other than on the road, you’re more likely to get into an accident.   Approximately one-quarter of all traffic accidents are related to cell phone use in America.That's 25% – or 1.3 million crashes.  Inclement weather – be it fog, the wind, rain, or snow – means your car can’t perform as normal and neither can the cars around you (regardless of how good a driver you are or those around you are). And even if no one is around you, you still run the risk of having a weather-related accident. Here's a few things to keep in mind:          Always keep your windshield wipers going in the rain or snow Defrost your windshield to keep it from fogging up Turn on your headlights to help others to see you If possible, try to avoid driving in the snow at all, especially if your car is rear wheel drive. If you must go out in the snow, drive extra slow, use the brakes and gas pedal gently, and maintain an increased stopping distance.  It is always best to have a "designated driver.” If someone you're with wants to drive and they've been drinking, don't let them. There are taxis, public transit, and people you can call for assistance. There is no reason to drive when alcohol is on the scene.          Never drive after you have had alcoholic beverages either. Even one beer can alter your ability to drive safely. After all, buzzed driving is drunk driving, especially to the cops.  When you're tired (especially if you fall asleep easily or have narcolepsy), your reaction time is impaired. Your brain isn't firing on all cylinders and you drive on autopilot, unable to take in all the stimuli around you. When that happens, you are more likely to put yourself in a dangerous situation without even realizing it.   Be aware that some medications can cause drowsiness and make operating a vehicle very dangerous.If you've started a new medication, ask your doctor if it is still safe to drive.  These vehicles (primarily Fire Department vehicles and ambulances) can override the normal pattern of traffic signals in some circumstances. Even if your light is green, you shouldn't go. Some cities have the technology to turn your light red, but others don't. If you're in a situation where you're moving forward, move to the right onto the shoulder to let them pass.   Both the emergency vehicle and the traffic signal must be equipped with the appropriate devices, and only some cities and certain intersections have such devices installed. One of the most common is the "Opticom" system, basically recognized as a very fast flashing white strobe light mounted at or near the top of the emergency vehicle (not the "wig-wag" flashing high-beam headlights). A small receiving unit mounted on the traffic signal pole receives the "strobe code" and turns traffic lights green for the approaching emergency vehicle and red in all other directions. Such systems have been shown to reduce traffic accidents and injuries/fatalities involving emergency vehicles while improving response times to life-threatening emergencies. Emergency vehicles can only take control of intersection traffic lights if they are traveling in an emergency response mode – with all emergency lights activated and siren sounding. Once the emergency vehicle travels through the intersection, the traffic signal returns to its normal pattern.  According to a recent study, five percent of all vehicles experience tire problems immediately before a crash. Tires that are underinflated by more than 25 percent are three times more likely to be involved in a crash related to tire problems than vehicles with proper inflation.   What’s more, tires underinflated up to 25 percent run the risk of overheating, leading to failure, and at the very least adversely affecting handling and tread life.  When your car is in tiptop shape, the likelihood of you getting into an accident due to a technical malfunction is greatly reduced. You can't prevent the weather, but you can prevent your car from causing your next accident.          Get your brakes checked. A surefire way to get into an accident is to have your brakes go out on you. Get your brake lining checked by your mechanic the next time you’re in for a tune-up.  Simply enough, to avoid accidents, you’ve got to be able to see. With your vision even slightly impaired, you could lose that split second you need to adjust your course and put yourself in danger.   Keep the mirrors positioned well, too. If you can’t see what’s behind you, next to you, or in your blind spot, you’re much, much more likely to get into a car accident.  In the event that you run into bad weather (snow or rain), it’s imperative that your windshield wipers work well. If they don’t, you won’t be able to see out of your car and properly determine what’s in front of you and how far away it is. The accident you could get you might not even see coming.   You can do this yourself quite easily. Read wikiHow's How to Change the Wiper Blades on Your Car for more information.	Slow down. Stay in your lane. Drive with both hands on the wheel. Don't tailgate the car in front of you. Use your signals properly. Keep your eyes moving. Always wear a seat belt. Drive in the curbside lane in street traffic. Park between two other vehicles. When you're driving, only drive. Avoid driving at night. Don’t text or talk on the phone while driving. Try to avoid driving in bad weather. Never get into a car with a drunk driver. Don’t drive when you’re tired, whether it’s night or not. Watch out for approaching emergency vehicles. Keep your tires properly inflated. Go in for regular tune-ups. Keep your windshield and mirrors clean. Replace your windshield wipers regularly.
You can use a tin candle-making mold, a cardboard tube with a solid bottom, or even a half-pint to pint-sized milk carton.If you are using a milk carton, open up the top all the way or cut it off so that you have a square-shaped opening.   Keep your work area clean by placing the mold on top of a baking sheet.You can also cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil first for easy clean up.; , Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place your candle-making pouring pot inside. If you do not own a candle-making pouring pot, you can use a large, glass measuring cup instead.Consider placing a metal lid or a cookie cutter under the pouring pot/measuring cup. This will ensue that the wax is receiving equal amounts of heat from all sides., You will only be using one-half to three-quarters of your mold, and half of that will be taken up by ice. Measure your wax accordingly. As a precaution, however, it might be a good idea to add 1 to 2 ounces (cc to cc grams) of wax in case something spills.If you are using a block of wax, you will need to cut it up into smaller chunks first. If you are using wax pellets or shavings, you do not need to cut them up. If you can't get any candle-making wax, you can use old candles instead. Make sure that they are all the same color, however.  Turn the heat up to medium-low, and let the water come to a soft boil; do not let the water come to a roiling boil, however.As the wax starts to melt, stir it often to help it melt evenly.   Do not leave the wax unattended. Melting wax is combustible. If you are using old candles, be sure to pull the old wicks out with a fork or a pair of chopsticks once the wax has melted.  Most candle-making wax is either white, ivory, or clear. It is almost always unscented. You can leave it like this if you want something simple, or you can make it look (and smell) more interesting by adding some dyes or fragrances. It is best to use dyes and fragrances intended for candle-making. Stir the wax until the dyes and/or fragrances are completely mixed in, with no streaks or swirls.Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of fragrance per 1 pound (455 grams) of wax. How much dye you add depends on how dark you want the candle to be. Start with a few drops of liquid dye, or a few shavings of a dye block. In a pinch, you can use a chunk or two of a crayon—just remove the wrapper first!  , The easiest way to do this would be to dip the tabbed part of the wick into the melted wax, then to quickly press it against the bottom of the mold.Alternatively, you can add a few drops of wax into the bottom of the mold first, then insert the wick.Can't get a tabbed candle wick? Make your own by tying a paper clip to the bottom of a plain candle wick. Can't get any wicks at all? Use a long candle stick instead. You will have to cut it down starting from the bottom until it is about the same height as your mold, however.  To prevent large holes or gaps, make sure that the ice chunks are no bigger than ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter).Also, make sure that the wick is centered at all times, or it will end up being crooked when you pour the wax.Experiment with using different shapes and sizes of ice cubes. You can even crush some of them with a hammer.  Move the pouring pot around as you pour so that you are not pouring in one spot constantly.A great idea would be to pour in a swirl or zigzag pattern.   The pouring pot/measuring cup will be hot. Use an oven mitt or a pot holder to handle it.  It will take about 1 to 2 hours for the wax to harden.Do not disturb the wax as it sets.  At this point, your candle is almost done. You can choose to take it out of the mold in the next step, or you can pour wax in a contrasting color over it. If you take it out now, your candle will have holes in it. If you fill it with more wax, you'll get a multi-colored candle. If you want a multi-colored candle, do the following:Melt and dye your candle wax as before. If you used fragrance, make sure that it is the same one. Pour the wax carefully over the candle; make sure that you pour it from different places. Let the wax harden again. It will take longer this time because you aren't using any ice.  You can try sliding the candle out. If it won't come out, try tearing the mold away from it instead. It might be a good idea to do this over a sink as there will be lots of water.  You may need to rotate the candle from time to time to help the water drain from all of the holes.  Remember to set it down on a heat-safe surface, such as a dish or a candle charger, to protect your table from melting wax.	Get a suitable mold, then set it aside. Assemble your double boiler. Measure out your wax, then add it to the pouring pot. Melt the wax until it reaches 175 to 185°F (80 to 85°C). Consider adding some fragrance and/or color to your wax. Attach your tabbed wick to the bottom of the mold. Fill the mold one-half to three-fourths of the way with ice. Pour the wax into the mold until it completely covers the ice. Wait for the wax to harden. Consider doing a second pour in a contrasting color. Take the candle out of the mold. Leave the candle in a sink or bowl for a few days so that the water can drain. Trim the wick down to ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), ten use your candle.Trimming the wick down will prevent the wax from smoking as it burns.
The leaves may not adhere properly if there is dirt, oil, and other debris on the outside of the vase. Wipe down the surface with rubbing alcohol on a piece of paper towel to ensure that it’s clean.You can use a clear or colored vase, depending on your preference. However, be sure that it’s made of glass or ceramic. If you don’t have a vase, you can use a mason jar and turn it into a vase.; , In order to position the leaves on the vase, they need to be slightly bendable. Wet the leaves lightly to loosen them up so they’re easier to position.Don’t overwet the leaves. Instead of running them under the faucet, try using a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist them. For the best results, use freshly fallen leaves that aren’t too dry or fragile. The vase looks best if you remove the stems from the leaves. You can use faux leaves if you can’t find any real leaves that you want to use.  When you’re ready to place the leaves on the vase, use a hot glue gun to place several dots of glue on the back of the leaves. Next, press the leaves to the vase, smoothing out any air bubbles. Hold them in place for 5 to 10 seconds to give the leaves time to adhere.You can add as many or as few leaves as you like. Covering the entire surface of the vase with leaves creates a distinctive look, but having some space between the leaves can also be pretty. It’s best to apply a single layer of leaves. If you try to place several layers on the vase, the leaves may fall off.  Once you’ve placed the leaves on the vase in your desired arrangement, allow the glue to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. If desired, you can tie raffia or a ribbon around the neck of the vase to complement the leaves.Using ribbon that matches the color of the leaves creates an simple elegant look for the vase. However, a ribbon in a contrasting color can make a bolder statement.	Clean the outside of a vase. Dampen the leaves lightly. Adhere the leaves to the vase with hot glue. Decorate the top of the vase.
Take out three elastic cords and make it to a door shape together.        Make a full circle by turning the right cords down; lay the left cords on the circle.       Bring the left cords down to the right cords up.       Bring the cord up through the two circles down and over.      ; ,  Take the top end to shape a hoop; go on braiding in the same way above; tie off the braiding shapes each time.       Stop braiding until the length suitable for your wrist.       Cut the redundant cords and glue it to fix.	Braid the cords at the beginning. Braid the cords to the end. Cut off two short leather cords; glue each to an end of a clasp to link with the leather cords.
Pruning done only for the health of the plant should be scheduled for the late winter or early spring, before new growth has had much chance for development.   Since burning bushes are primarily grown for their foliage, you don't need to worry too much about accidentally removing flower buds. The most vibrant foliage will grow on new branches, though, so it is still best to trim the bush before new growth has developed. When you decide to prune a burning bush for the health of the plant alone, you only need to worry about removing branches that could encourage disease to spread through the plant and destroy it. Even if you opt to prune the plant for shape, you should still prune it for health before worrying shape maintenance.; , Use pruning shears to cut away any dead branches or branches that have been severely injured.Branches are most often injured by disease, insect infestation, animals, or bad weather. Cut diseased branched down to their point of origin on the main stem. Doing so is the only way to make sure that the disease does not spread. Injured branches can be cut back to their point of origin on the main stem, or you may wish to only cut away the injured portion of the branch. In the latter case, cut the injured branch down to a side branch and make the cut 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the bud.  Look for any branches or branch stubs that are intertwined or rubbing against each other. Use pruning shears to remove these branches, as well.   Cut these branches down to their point of origin on the main stem. Problem branches like these will typically grow back again in the same direction, so it is best to remove them completely instead of trimming them down.	Prune in late winter or early spring. Remove dead or dying branches. Cut away branches that rub together.
Select a broad leaf herbicide that matches your weeds. If the weed you want killed is not on the label, don't buy it.   Watch for child and pet warnings! READ and FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS on the container.  Products are frequently supplied with spray bottles so you can apply them directly to the weeds.   Make sure it's not windy or you can end up killing plants you wanted or were going to eat. , This will allow you to efficiently apply a large amount of chemical weed killer to the whole lawn.   Remove any toys, furniture, pets or clothing before you spray. The chemicals can be dangerous to people and animals.	Identify and find herbicides for the weeds in your lawn. Apply the herbicide with whatever applicator it comes with. Treat entire patches of weeds and spot-kill the few isolated weeds that sprout up around the yard.  , Attach a sprayer to your garden hose if you have an entire lawn of weeds that are out of control or have not received any attention for a long time.
Use pliers to bend 18 to 24 inches (45 to 61 cm) of framing wire into a hook. The indentation for the hook should lie at the exact center and should be about 4 inches (10 cm) deep. Bend either end of to the side and away from the indentation in a spiral or curlicue.   Make sure that the framing wire is sturdy enough to hold your plate. Size #2 wire is usually strong enough and holds up to 51 lbs (23 kg) standard. This can vary based on the manufacturer, though, so check the label specifications before you pick the wire gauge.  Look at the front of the plate to determine where the center top should be. Hold the wire against the back of the plate so that the hooked indentation lies at this center top, oriented upward. Adhere the wire to the back of the plate in this position using a hot glue gun.   Apply hot glue in between the wire and the plate. You should also get glue along the sides and top of the wire. The more you use, the more secure the bond will be. Do not allow any hot glue to get onto the hook/indentation. Wait 5 to 20 minutes, giving the glue plenty of time to cool and harden. The hot glue can be difficult to remove later on, so you should only use this technique if you do not plan on ever using the plate for practical purposes.  Apply several layers of duct tape over the glued wire and onto the back of the plate.   You should cover all parts of the wire except for the hook/indentation. Make sure that none of the tape is visible from the front of the plate.  Carefully bend the exposed wire indentation back, bringing it out at an angle. There should be roughly 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of space in between the top of the indentation and the back of the plate.   The wire should not wiggle or break off from the plate as you bend the hook out. If it does, you need to use more hot glue and/or duct tape to secure the bond better. This bent portion of the wire is where the nail will rest.  Position the plate against the wall to determine where you want it to hang. Mark the top of the plate, then set it down and measure the distance between the top of the plate and the top of your hooked wire. Make a second mark on the wall matching this distance, then firmly hammer the nail into this second mark.   Trace your marks lightly using a pencil so that you can erase them later. Use a nail with a large head or a special picture hanger. At least half of the nail should be inside the wall, but you should also have 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of nail extending out from the wall for the wire hanger to rest on.  Carefully rest the hooked wire onto the nail in the wall. With this, the process should be finished.   If the hook seems loose as you hang the plate, reinforce it with more glue or tape. If the nail does not seem secure, you may need to use a different nail or choose a different spot. If the plate appears crooked, try bending the top of the wire so that the nail rests on it differently. If this does not work, you will need to scrape off the tape and glue so that you can reposition the wire.	Bend framing wire into a hook. Hot glue the wire onto the back of the plate. Reinforce the bond with duct tape. Bend the hook back. Hammer a nail into the wall. Hang the plate.
You should end up with one loop on your hook and the working end of your yarn sticking out across the last stitch.       ; , Begin this by looping the working end of your yarn around your hook. Rotate your hook slightly, so the yarn stays on it, and then pull the loop of yarn back through the loop that was already on your hook. You should now have one new loop on your hook.  You can do this by pulling the extra yarn from the working end of your project.  Pull out the loose end of the yarn (your working end), leaving one piece of yarn sticking out of the end of your project. This piece should be at least a couple inches long. , If you are having a hard time doing this, simply bend the middle of the yarn in half and squeeze it tight. Push the bent area through the eye of the needle.  Using the needle, pull the yarn back through the middle of the last three stitches you made. Pull the end of the yarn out, so that the needle and yarn are sticking out in the middle of the row, and then stick the needle back into the project. Head back in the other direction with your needle and yarn, inserting the needle one row down and pushing it through the middle of about three stitches. This should lock your yarn tail in place.  The yarn should stay in place, hidden in the middle of several rows of your stitches.  Make sure that the end of the yarn is still tucked away neatly and that the tension on the row is that same as the rest of your project. Your project is now finished!	Finish the stitches on your last row. Make one additional chain stitch. Pull the loop off your hook and pull it out a bit, extending it up about three inches. Clip the middle of the loop with your scissors. Pull the piece of yarn sticking out of your project taut.This should tie the end of the project off permanently and effectively, creating a solid knot.  , Thread the end of the yarn onto a yarn needle. Thread the end of the yarn back through your project so it is hidden. Trim any excess yarn once you have threaded the yarn back and forth through the end of your project. Stretch out the last row of your project.
Start with singing a note that comes most naturally to you. Test your ability to carry the note by singing it as high as you can without straining. Then, go as low as you can without straining. For added practice, sing your favorite tune at the highest pitch and lowest pitch you can. Smile while you sing for a brighter, clearer vocal sound. Once you learn your range, identify your voice type.   If you’re female, and your voice is high, your voice will be considered a Soprano. If it’s low, it will be considered an alto. If you’re male and your voice is high, your voice will be considered a Tenor. If it’s low, it will be considered Bass. Practice at least one singing/warm-up exercise for at least 10 minutes a day.Listen to your pitch, and focus on your tone to deliver the best sound for your voice. Challenge yourself by singing in different pitches, volumes and speeds. Be comfortable and learn to sing well with your own voice before teaching others. You will need to make your voice versatile, and know how to sing in many different ranges and styles.; , Research and find vocal coaches in your area. Scan their websites or call them to find out what services they specialize in. Request to meet with them, and if possible, ask them to evaluate your voice for a class that fits you best. Take the lessons on a weekly basis, or as recommended by your vocal coach for best results.   You might also pursue professional vocal or opera training from a performing or liberal arts school for professional results. Be mindful that lessons can be pricy, and run as much as $30 for a 30 minute session. Getting vocal training is often seen as a prerequisite, as many vocal coaches begin their careers as professional singers.  Pursue a college degree in music, preferably from a performing arts school or a program that offers singing and vocal work, as well as teaching and education classes. Learn music theory and how it applies to sounds. Learn how to read notes, in a class, or creatively using online apps. Take yourself out to musical concerts and train yourself to listen to harmony, tone and other important elements of music. Become familiar with a variety of singing voices and vocal styles.   Learn to play an instrument, like the piano or guitar, to use as a guide to study notes and pitch. Start with playing simple notes or songs, like Mary Had A Little Lamb to learn the keys. Practice matching your voice to the musical keys. Use online tutorials, or take lessons from a professional, if needed.	Practice your singing voice. Acquire vocal training. Study music.
The air regulator is the device at the bottom of the gun where compressed air can be hooked up to the bottom of the air gun. Make sure that the compressed air source is disconnected from the regulator first and then you can disconnect the regulator from the gun.; , You need to make sure you dispose of the waste in the proper containers. There should be at least two containers for the unused material:   Hardened (Catalyzed) Material. This means any materials that do not stay a liquid form but turn into a solid material. Base coat (Liquid) Material. This means the any material that stays in liquid form.  By wiping out the excess material will make cleaning out the cup and lid a lot easier with the thinner. Bear in mind that when drying with paper towels paint thinner is a corrosive liquid and easily able to deteriorate and soften the towels being used.  Waste thinner is also referred to as recycled thinner; it is paint thinner that has been used before. The throat of the gun is in the inside at the very bottom of the cup.  To elaborate this is to make sure that all the remaining paint or base coat is dissolved by the thinner.  To do this you point the nozzle into the container and squeeze the trigger like you would in normal operation. ,, Remove the paint cup lid as well.  To do this, first remove the fluid adjustment knob, located on the rear of the gun, it is generally the middle knob although this can vary depending on model. Clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.  Again, clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.  Then using the paint gun key find the correct size for the fluid nozzle and remove the fluid nozzle by turning counterclockwise. To reiterate, clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.  Rinse gun body, cup lid, air cap and all parts that have remaining paint, excluding any gaskets. Though this process can be quite repetitive, doing so well only save you from future headaches and you can be assured a clean paint gun.  Use the compressed air to clean holes and moving parts that can’t be reached with just wiping. Last make sure gun is completely dry after using compressed air, as excess liquids can be blown back onto the surfaces from the pressure on crevices and moving parts.  Lubricate moving parts and threads as you replace them. You want these parts to be oiled to prevent sticking or seizing of removable and non-removable mechanical moving parts.  After you have finished the gun is ready for use or storage.  Start by making sure all waste material is contained in appropriate containers away from any heat source. Next, make sure all work stations and tools are clean and put away. After completion of this step you have a clean, contaminant free paint gun and work station.	Remove the air regulator from the paint. Open the lid from the paint cup to pour out any unused material. Using paper towels, wipe as much left over material from the cup and lid of the cup as possible. Pour a small amount (fill gun throat to overflowing) of waste thinner into the cup. Shake the paint gun vigorously ensuring to coat the inside of the cup with thinner. Run used thinner into waste thinner container through the fluid nozzle. Wipe down all parts with paper towels until dry.  , Repeat steps four through seven at least once or until satisfied with initial cleaning.  , Remove the paint cup by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off. Remove the fluid needle to avoid bending or damaging the needle during the removal of other parts. Take the now revealed spring out, press on the trigger, and pull the fluid needle straight out. Remove the air cap on the front of the paint gun by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off. When satisfied with secondary cleaning wipe dry and begin rinse with clean thinner. Dry all parts with clean paper towels and if available compressed air. Reassemble the gun and parts. Wipe any excess oil off the gun with clean paper towels. After all steps have been completed begin final clean up.
Find an instructor at a pre-professional ballet school that works with a professional ballet company. A great instructor can provide one-on-one help which can prevent injury and improve your poses.Avoid simply relying on instruction from your peers or online lessons. You need to get proper feedback from a professional who's able to see if you're technique is correct.; , Avoid dancing on hard floors like cement. Instead, the studio you use should have sprung wood (like harlequin) floors. This will help the floor absorb the shock of your movements. A good floor can prevent shin splints and other injuries.Make sure the floor doesn't have too much rosin covering it in uneven patches. This can make it more likely for you to injure yourself.  Warming up exercises can loosen your muscles, making them less likely to tear or strain. Do exercises that get your blood pumping and really warm you up before you begin dancing.These will get you ready for more intense activity, which can improve your ballet dancing and prevent injury.   Do standing exercises for several minutes or try an aerobic exercise at a normal pace. Never push yourself too hard during a warm up.  Exercise (physical training) is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of injury. While ballet is highly physical, most ballet dancers aren't active enough to improve their aerobic health. Work on a general fitness regimen throughout the week to reduce your risk of injury.Be sure to avoid sports that are known for causing damage to the knees like basketball or tennis.  If you feel pain, this is your body telling you that something is wrong. Ask your instructor to watch you do the movement that caused you pain. Sometimes, you might just need technique correction which will stop the pain. But, if your instructor sees nothing wrong with your form, see a doctor.If no specific move is causing you pain, follow the three day rule. If you feel pain for three days, tell your instructor.  Your knees should always be in-line with your toes. If they're out of alignment, you'll put excess strain on the kneecaps and your lower leg muscles whether you're doing a plie or turnout. Stand with your knees soft and keep your spine elongated.Never lock your knees. This can hyperextend your knee, increasing mobility. But, it will also lead to knee injury and mis-alignment.  Research shows that using your knees spread your feet apart creates poor alignment and can lead to injury.Instead, keep your muscles flexible. Lift your toes up and away from each other so that they're each at 90 degree angles. You should shift your weight not from your knees, but from your hips. This will help your feet move apart naturally.   You should never force your turnout. Using your knees instead of your hip muscles can put extra strain on your lower leg muscles and damage your knee.  Foot hyperpronation ("rolling in") is a cause of knee injuries. When your feet roll in, the arches roll forward. Your tendons will try to compensate for this imbalance, leading to injury and inflammation (like tendonitis).Instead, balance your weight throughout your foot.   You should feel your weight at the heel, the big toe, and the little toe., Your foot should be pointed so that it creates a straight line extending from your calf. If you try to force your toes or point harder, you may actually make your foot sickle inward. Sickling breaks the imaginary line stretching from your calf so that it curves. It can also damage your muscles and form leading to injury.You should keep your heel forward, not off to the side which can cause your foot to turn inward.	Work with a professional. Practice on hardwood floors. Warm up. Do physical training. Pay attention to pain. Practice proper knee alignment. Use your hips for good turnout. Distribute weight throughout your feet. Point your feet.
Within 15 minutes of coming into contact with poison ivy, wash the affected area of skin with warm water and mild soap.The plant oil enters the skin quickly, so you should wash the area as quickly as possible to reduce the severity of the rash. Use a brush to scrub under the fingernails. Otherwise, plant oil trapped under your nails can spread to other parts of your body. Remove any clothing that came into contact with the poison ivy plant. Change into fresh clothes after washing the area. If you suspect that your pet came into contact with the plant, you should immediately bathe the animal to remove poison ivy oil from its fur.  The rash can cause discomfort and sweating, but sweat and body heat can make the itching worse. Apply a cool compress to soothe the itching and keep yourself cool.   You should also wear loose, light clothing to prevent yourself from becoming too warm.  Gently rub a thin layer of either product over the poison ivy rash as needed.   Calamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream can both reduce itching and blistering. Follow the label instructions concerning how much to apply and how often.  An over-the-counter antihistamine medication may be used if lotions and creams are unable to soothe or stop the itching.   The itchy rash produced after coming into contact with poison ivy is actually the result of an allergic reaction that most people have to the poison ivy plant. Antihistamines are used to treat allergies, so they often have an effect against allergy-related rashes like this. Always follow the instructions on the label of the antihistamine concerning dosage.  If the rash is especially bad and does not respond to home remedies, contact your health care provider.   In severe cases, a doctor will usually prescribe steroids. These may be administered by injection or in capsule form.  Any clothing worn when you came into contact with the poison ivy must be washed to prevent the oil from spreading. Likewise, all tools used when treating yourself for a poison ivy rash must also be washed.   Wash clothes in hot water and detergent. Thoroughly rinse the washing machine when done. Wash tools in a diluted bleach solution or with rubbing alcohol.	Wash the area immediately. Use a cool compress. Apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream. Try taking an antihistamine. Call your doctor, if necessary. Wash all tools and clothing thoroughly.
To recharge the refrigerant in your air conditioner, first shut down your AC unit, then follow the steps below:  ,   The low pressure hose is normally blue and is connected to the suction line—the larger of the two pipes. The high pressure hose is generally red and is connected to the liquid line, which is the smaller of the two pipes.  Let it to run for at least 15 minutes so that the system can reach steady state operation.  This will give you a comparative analysis of how the system is performing, with the following measurements:   The outdoor air temperature The return air temperature at the furnace/air handler The suction line temperature The liquid line temperature Newer units will usually have a label inside the electrical cover with specific instructions for your unit. It will typically tell you to measure superheat or sub-cooling. It will also give you a chart that has values for superheat or sub-cooling for a given outdoor temperature.  Check the charging procedure chart in your unit to determine what type of metering device your system uses. It will either be a thermostatic expansion valve or a restrictor orifice.   If your system uses a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV), use the following values:  System superheat: 18°F (-7°C) System sub-cooling: 25°F (-4°C)   If your system uses a restrictor, you can use the table below as a guide. It contains recommended superheat values for given indoor and outdoor air temps: To find the required superheat value, draw a line from the outside air temperature down to the return air temperature. The value in that row/column is the required superheat temperature.  If the tests show that refrigerant is required, check for evidence of leaks and repair them. Leaks can typically be found around any joints or connections:   Welded or brazed joints Pressure ports Threaded tubing connectors Any place where refrigerant lines may vibrate or rub against the unit chassis or other components.  Do not tip the refrigerant container, as this will introduce liquid refrigerant into the suction side of the compressor, and can result in damage to the unit.  Slowly, and in small amounts, introduce refrigerant into the suction line of the system, and allow 5 to 10 minutes for the system to stabilize between addition of refrigerant. When charging a new system, or recharging an evacuated system, the refrigerant is added by weight, according to the system specifications, but trimming a unit, or adding to an existing refrigerant charge, is less precise.   Check pressure and temperature readings, and determine if more refrigerant is needed. Repeat until everything looks normal.  When the AC has completed a cycle, turn off power to the unit, and remove the gauges.fh	Take the following steps. Attach the hoses from the gauge manifold to your system's pressure ports. Turn on the AC. Check the temperatures. Determine your metering device. Check for leaks. Connect the charging or supply hose from your manifold to the refrigerant container with the container in an upright position. Add refrigerant. Observe a complete cooling cycle.
Glass painting requires a little more than just paint and brushes. You will also need to prepare your glass piece properly, so that the paint will stick. Some paints also need to be cured in an oven. Here is a list of what you will need to get a basic painting done:   Glass object to paint Cotton balls Rubbing alcohol Design printed on paper Masking tape Glass paints Paint brushes Plate or palette Oven (optional); , You can paint things like jars, cups, or wine glasses. You can also paint a glass panel. The best place to get a glass panel is from a picture frame. When you are done painting, you can display the finished piece inside the frame. Make sure that the panel in the frame is glass, however; some frames come with an acrylic panel instead of glass.   You can take the back out of a picture frame, or leave it in. If you decide to leave the back in, you might want to cover it with some white paper. Most glass paint is translucent, so it will show up best against a white background.  Even if the glass looks clean, you will still want to wash it. Any oil, dirt, or dust may keep the paint from sticking to the surface.  It needs to be printed on paper. If you are painting something like a cup or jar, the paper needs to be trimmed down so that it can fit inside.   The best patterns to use are just outlines, like from a coloring book.  If you plan on using this glass piece for eating or drinking out of, move the pattern to a place where food, drink, or mouths won't be touching it. Even if a glass paint is labeled as "non-toxic," it may not be food-safe.If you are painting on a flat sheet of glass, place the pattern face down on the glass. Tape the edges down with masking tape, and flip the glass over. If you are painting on a cup, place the pattern inside the cup. Move it around until it is where you want it to be. Press the paper against the wall of the cup, and tape it in place. Keep borders in mind. If you are going to put the glass panel inside a frame, make sure that the frame won't be covering your design., Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol, and wipe down the entire surface of your glass piece. Any oily residue left on the glass from when you handled it may keep the paint from sticking.Try not to touch the area where the pattern is from now on.  You are doing this, because the first bit of paint often tends to gush out in a glob. It is better for this to happen on a sheet of paper than on your painting.   Some glass paint liners are labeled as "leading" or as "dimensional." Most glass liners come in black, but you might also find them in other colors as well, such as silver and gold.  Hold the tip just above the glass, and start tracing the design. Use long, continuous strokes. If you make short strokes, your lines are more likely to end up uneven and goopy. Also, try not to drag the tip on the glass. This will cause the paint to come out too thin and streaky.   If you are left-handed, try to start tracing from the right side first. If you are right-handed, start tracing from the left. This will help prevent you from accidentally smudging the wet outline while you work.  Once you have finished outlining your piece, look over it carefully. If you see any lumps or clumps, you can wipe them away with a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. If the paint has dried, you can scratch it away with a craft knife., Most glass paint liners will take about six to eight hours to dry.You might want to refer to the label on the bottle for a more specific drying time, however, as each brand will be a little different.   If you are pressed for time, you can hold a fan or hairdryer over the paint. This will help it dry faster. If you are using a hair dryer, make sure that you are using the lowest setting., If your glass paint comes with a pointy tip, you can apply the paint to the glass directly from the bottle. You can also squirt the paint onto a pallet and apply it with a paintbrush; this will give you the most control.   You can use both synthetic and natural brushes for glass painting. Synthetic brushes may cost less, but they will be more likely to leave behind brush strokes. Brushes made from soft, natural fibers, may be more expensive, but they will leave behind the smoothest finish., Do not press down too hard with the brush, or you will wipe the existing paint off. Instead, let the brush glide across the surface that needs to be painted. If the paint is too thin in one area, wait until it dries before applying a second coat. If you try to go over wet paint a second time, you may end up wiping it off.Glass paint will shrink a little when it dries. Try to paint all the way to the outline. If you are having troubles reaching a tight area, such as a point or corner, use a toothpick to spread the paint.The thicker you lay the paint on, the more it will level off. This reduces brush strokes.To create a swirled, marbled effect, put a few drops of two or more colors into the space you want colored. Use a toothpick to lightly swirl the colors together. Do not over-mix, or you may lose the swirled effect and end up with a solid color., When you are ready to move on to a new color, dip the brush in water and swirl it about to remove any excess paint. Lightly dab the brush against a paper towel. If you see any color on the towel, rinse the brush again. If you don't see any color, keep tapping the brush until there's no water left on the bristles. If water gets into the paints, it can cause beading., Look over your piece carefully, and see if there are any places that need touching up. It is much easier to touch things up while the paint is still wet than when it is dry. Use Q-tips, paintbrushes, and toothpicks dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe away any excess paint. This is especially useful if you went outside the lines.Use a pin or needle to pierce any bubbles that may have formed in the paint. Be sure to do this while the paint is still wet.  Some brands of paint need to dry for several days before they can be used, while others need to dry for up to a month. Some brands might require you to bake your piece in the oven. Always refer to the label on your bottle of paint.Some labels will tell you to "cure" your paint for a certain amount of time. This simply means to let the paint "dry."  , Depending on the brand of paint you used, however, the paint may not be cured all the way. If the paint feels sticky or gummy, it is not cured and needs to dry longer.   Most glass paints will be completely cured after 21 days.  This will allow you to wash your piece in the dishwasher. Place your painted piece onto a foil-covered baking sheet, then put the baking sheet into a cold oven. Set the oven to 350°F (175°C), or whatever temperature the manufacturer recommends. Bake the item for about 30 minutes, then turn the oven off. Do not take the piece out of the oven yet. Instead, let the piece and the oven both cool down first. Removing the glass too soon may cause it to crack.   Most paint with glitter in it cannot be cured in the oven. You must allow them to air-cure for 21 days. The label on the bottle will tell you whether or not the paint can be oven-cured.If you are using glass paints from different brands, know that they may have different curing temperatures and times. To avoid burning the paint, stick with the lower baking temperature and time., Most glass paints are delicate after they cure, and should only be hand-washed using a soft cloth of sponge. If you cured your piece in the oven, you might be able to wash it in the top rack of a dishwasher. Never leave painted glass sitting in water, even if you oven-cured it. The water will cause the paint to flake away. Also, never use a scratchy sponge on a glass piece; you will scrape the paint off.	Gather your supplies. Find a glass piece to paint. Clean the glass with some soap and water. Have your pattern or design ready. Place the pattern where you want it to be. Wipe the surface of the glass down with rubbing alcohol. Get some glass paint liner and squeeze a tiny amount out onto a sheet of paper. Use a glass paint liner or dimensional glass paint to trace the outlines on your pattern. Make any touchups, if necessary, when you are done. Let the outline dry all the way. Squirt some glass paint onto a pallet or plate. Fill in the spaces with glass paint. Be sure to rinse and dry your brush before moving onto a different color. Clean your painting up again, if needed. Read the instructions on the paint bottle. Allow the paint to dry for at least 48 hours.After this, the paint should be dry to the touch, and can be gently handled. Consider baking the item for durable finish. Know how to wash your glass piece safely. Finished.
If you are not in your own vehicle and your choices are running on foot or using a vehicle, opt for the vehicle. It's still extremely dangerous, but will give you better odds of surviving than being on foot.If you do not have your own vehicle but find an abandoned vehicle as you flee from the fire, enter the vehicle and hotwire the car. If you need to break a window to enter the vehicle, break a rear window so that the front windows can remain closed. This is important, as it will help keep smoke out of the vehicle. Do not break into and hot wire a car that someone is likely to come looking for. You should never take someone else's means of escaping the fire. This method is only really applicable if you find a car that someone clearly left behind to flee on foot.  Once you're in a car, you'll need to ensure that the car is safely sealed from the smoke surrounding you. This is crucial, since you will otherwise risk passing out from carbon monoxide.   Roll up the windows and close the air vents., If the vehicle runs and you're capable of driving it, then do so. But it's important to drive safely, so that you can see your surroundings and so that anyone else on the road can see you.   Drive slowly and keep your headlights on.Keep an eye out for other vehicles and pedestrians. Stop to let any pedestrians you encounter ride along with you.Do not drive through heavy smoke. If the smoke is too thick to see where you're steering, it may be safer to park and wait it out.If you must stop the vehicle, park as far away from trees and heavy brush as possible., If the smoke is too thick to see the road, or if you cannot drive the car for any reason, you should remain in the vehicle. You will be more likely to be injured or killed by leaving the vehicle than you would be if you remained inside.Don't worry about the gas tank. Vehicles with metal gas tanks rarely ever explode. You are much safer staying inside the car than you would be on foot.Keep the windows up and the air vents closed.Lie down on the floor of the vehicle and cover yourself with a blanket or coat, if possible., Whether you are able to drive or you are forced to hunker down inside a vehicle, it's important to know what to expect so that you do not panic. Just remember that no matter what happens, if the fire surrounds the car you should not leave the vehicle.The temperature inside the vehicle will increase considerably. Don't worry - it's still safer inside the vehicle than outside.Air currents low to the ground may rock the car. Some smoke and even sparks may enter the vehicle. Don't be alarmed. Just stay low on the floor of the vehicle and keep breathing through a wet cloth to protect your airways.	Find a vehicle. Ensure that you can breathe. Drive if you can. Remain in the vehicle. Know what to expect.
The work you're about to do involves finely-ground brake dust or asbestos dust, and breathing it can be extremely hazardous to your health. Get a mask that's designed for the job of filtering asbestos, not a simple paper one you might use in a shop. Send the kids and pets away, too. Especially the kids—you don't want them anywhere near this project, not even for a moment.; , Block the front wheels with wheel chocks. Jack up the car and support it with jack stands.    Never work on a car supported by a jack alone. Blocks of wood or bricks or even cinder blocks aren't suitable substitutes. Finish removing the nuts and remove the tire.    Note: WD-40 is not a penetrating oil.  It may help to wiggle it a bit as you pull. It may be necessary to back off the brake adjuster to remove the drum. This is done through the brake adjustment hole in the drum or on the backing plate using a brake adjuster tool to turn the adjuster to loosen the brakes enough to remove the drum. ,   It should be refaced or replaced if it is scored. Drum brakes have a bunch of springs and levers for the self-adjuster and parking brake. They are usually different colors. Take a picture with a digital camera or make a detailed drawing of where everything is before you take anything apart!  , Doing this in a container will help keep the dust from becoming airborne. Remember: the dust from most brakes is asbestos, and you don't want to breathe it in. Wear a mask.  Make sure they have holes in all the same places. Some vehicles have two different shoes called a leading and trailing shoe.   Make sure the brake shoes are the same width.    Remove the shoe return springs. Detach the parking brake lever. Hold the shoe retaining pin from the back and remove the retainer springs. Spread the shoes apart from the top and disengage the shoes from the wheel cylinder pins. Remove both shoes and the self-adjuster as one unit. Lay the old shoes on the ground next to the new ones. Sometimes the front and back shoes are different. The shoe with the shorter strip of lining usually goes towards the front.  Carefully tip the tops of the shoes inward to loosen the tension on the self-adjuster spring. Remove the self adjuster. Inspect and clean all brake parts to be reused and check for signs of damage or wear and replace as needed. It is recommended to replace all the springs with a new set. The adjuster should be unscrewed, cleaned and lubed with anti-seize. Remove the spring and immediately hook it onto the new shoes exactly as you removed it. Inspect the brake wheel cylinder for any signs of leakage and replace if needed.    The brake backing plates should be cleaned and lubed with a small amount of anti-seize on the slide points and anchor points. Screw the self adjuster back in. One side will be a left-hand thread. Place the self adjuster on the new shoes and spread the tops apart to tighten the spring. Put the shoes back in place and slip the retaining pins through the right holes. Install the shoe retainer springs. Attach the shoes to the wheel cylinder pins. Reattach the parking brake lever. Install the return springs. Using a brake adjustment sizing tool, adjust the brakes to fit the brake drum.  If anything looks different start over.    Slide the new or resurfaced drum over the wheel studs. Install lock screws in drum if equipped. Adjust the brakes through the drum or through the backing plate till a slight drag on the brake drum is felt. Reinstall the tire. Check brake adjustment and readjust as needed to have a slight drag on the drum. Do not over tighten the brakes or they could lock up. Remove the jack stand. Lower the jack. Torque the lug nuts and reinstall the hub cap. Repeat on other side.  Bleed out the brake system if any wheel cylinders were replaced. Road test the vehicle to verify brakes work correctly.	Put on an asbestos respirator. Remove the hubcap and loosen the lug nuts. Spray the hub of the wheel with a penetrating oil such as PB Blaster. Grab the brake drum by the edges and pull it off. Note: some brake drums are held on with screws so you will need to remove those first.  , Once the drum is off take a look at it. Place the whole brake mechanism in a container and spray it with brake cleaner. Compare the new brake shoes with the old ones. Dismantle the brake. Rebuild the new brake. Check your new brakes with the photo you took earlier. Put it all back together.
There are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving: straight back, offset back, alley dock, and parallel parking. Each of these can be identified by the following characteristics:    Straight back spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular (L-shaped) angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area.  Offset back spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid. These meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle.  Alley dock spaces are almost always for semi-trucks. These require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading/unloading dock, which is usually at a right angle (L-shape) to the passage.  Parallel parking spaces are on the side of the road, with either traffic, obstacles, or empty spaces before or after the spot. These require you to back your vehicle in, and can be especially challenging. New drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible., This is going to be slightly different for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer versus large, normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab. While large, attached-bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving, these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn. Semi-trucks/vehicles with trailers will turn backwards opposite the direction you turn your wheel.Getting the hang of backing up a semi-truck/vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice. You should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning. If you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space, you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles, like a cheap folding chair, in an empty parking area. This way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer/rear end around obstacles.  You'll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn't cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near-side spot, or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far-side spot. The more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear-end before approaching the parked vehicles. This extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident.   Roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle. You want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors. Do this especially it it's raining, as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view. Ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle. Even well-behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up. A clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others.  Your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in. However, mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features, like thin metal signs, posts, and so on. Take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle. Then:   Compare your walk-around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view. Note any inconsistencies, difficult to see obstacles, or missed obstacles. Evaluate the size of the parking spot. If you feel that the spot might not be a good fit, or if you are nervous in your ability to park, you are probably better off finding another parking spot. Adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle. Now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking, you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into. Your mirrors will normally be situated for straight-traffic driving, so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely., For attached-bed trucks as well, but especially for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer, you should swing your front-end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel in the direction of the parking spot. This will allow the rear-end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in. Once your rear-end is angled diagonally into the spot, straighten it by turning your wheel ¼ turn or less in the direction away from the spot.   The more space between you and the already parked vehicles/obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park, the more time you'll have to align your rear end with the parking spot. This will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear-end into the spot. Outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot, which began the hard turn of your rear-end toward the spot, you should only make slight adjustments while backing up. Large adjustments will likely result in over- or under-steering. If you feel your angle of approach too far off, you should pull out and start again. You should keep a close eye on the front- and rear-end of your vehicle during these maneuvers. While swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear-end into the spot, it's easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into., Once your rear end is aligned with the spot, your cab will likely still be at an angle to it. Allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot, then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut - in the direction of the spot. This should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear-end. Use gentle steering corrections at this point; oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer/rear-end changing significantly.   Some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt. Even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot. Adjust your vehicle as necessary. You may need to pull out of your spot, straighten your vehicle one more time, and reverse back into it, nice and even. When pulling out, be careful your rear-end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles.	Identify your backing up maneuver. Understand the mechanics of backing up. Pull ahead of your spot. Check your mirrors and do a walk-around. Swing out wide with your cab. Straighten out your cab.
If the food you are attempting to color is already a color other than white, this will influence the result of your dyeing efforts. Don't expect blue frosting to turn red if you add juiced raspberries to it, for example.   When in doubt of how something will turn out, use a small portion of dye and food to test the outcome. You can then adjust the shade of your coloring substance if necessary by mixing it with other shades. Avoid mixing too many different colored dyes together when trying to settle on a color. This can end up making the dye lose its vibrancy and turn out brownish.  In many cases, there are multiple options for making one color of food dye; in such cases, choose the one with the more subtle flavor. For example, both turmeric and saffron can be used for yellow coloring, but turmeric is less intense and usually makes a better choice.An exception to this would be if you actually want to add flavor from your dye to the food. In such cases, be sure to match the flavor types (such as sweet with sweet) to avoid creating an unappealing mixture.Not all dye production methods are equal in terms of intensity. Generally speaking, juicing and blending will create dyes that are both brighter and more intense tasting than the boiling or drying methods recommended for some vegetables., To keep your food from becoming too wet while ensuring even coloring, take care to create food dyes that compliment the consistency of your food. This will take some trial and error, but common sense also goes a long way!   For powdered coloring, stir into wet, blended foods such as cake icing or mashed potatoes. Sprinkling powder on a dry food will not spread the coloring consistently. For liquid coloring, use sparingly in all foods unless wetness is not a concern. Dry foods, for example, can become too soggy if too much liquid coloring is used.  Depending on the kind of food you are coloring, you can get rid of flavor contamination from your food dye by adding additional flavors. For instance, a hint of flavor from beet juice coloring in cake icing can be easily covered up with a drop or two of vanilla or peppermint extract.This method doesn't work quite as well for savory foods colored with sweet dyes. If you color cauliflower red using raspberry puree, for example, even lots of salt and butter might not be able to mask the sweetness of the dye. Many extracts and other substances that can be useful for masking flavors, such as truffle oil, are quite expensive (and potent), so use them sparingly!	Pick compatible colors. Go for dye options with subtle flavors. Pay attention to consistency. Mask unwanted flavors when necessary.
Designing a lighting scheme for indoor plants begins with acknowledging a simple truth: plants will never respond to electric light as well as sunlight. If you have a windowsill or covered porch that gets a lot of natural light, position your garden there. Even diffused sunlight can produce much better results than wholly artificial light.; , Before buying lights and setting up your indoor garden, you'll want to consider just what type of light is needed. Plants respond to 3 different aspects of light: color, intensity, and duration.   The color of light is determined by the wavelength of the light waves. Sunlight contains the full visible spectrum of light, and plants respond to each of these colors. However, red and blue light are the most important for plant growth. Lights marketed as grow lights will typically be predominantly red and blue. The intensity of light needed will vary between plants. Succulents, cacti, and other plants originating in arid regions typically require a large amount of light. Rainforest understory plants like pothos and philodendron prefer lower amounts of light. The duration of the light is also important. Plants do not like to be exposed to light for 24 hours every day. In fact, plants can be classed as either short-day or long-day varieties, which prefer 8-10 hours or 14-18 hours of daily light respectively.  Grow lights can be purchased from nurseries, home improvement stores, some lighting stores, and some specialty online retailers. While plants will benefit a little from any type of electric light, it is important to consider a few different features of grow lights when planning your indoor garden.   Fluorescent tube lamps are the standard choice for lighting indoor plants. Full-spectrum bulbs are the best, and will often be packaged as "grow lights." Bulbs marked as "cool white" will have a preponderance of blue wavelengths, while "warm white" bulbs will have more red wavelengths. In general, blue light boosts leaf growth, and red light aids in flowering and fruiting. Newer LED lamps can provide the same spectrum and intensity of light as fluorescent lamps while using much less energy. LED bulbs also last much longer. Look for LED lights specifically packaged as grow lights.  Once you have purchased your lighting, you can set up your indoor garden. Use a mix of natural and electric light if possible, and be careful to position plants that prefer full sunlight closest to the grow lights. You may want to rotate plants through different positions regularly to ensure each is getting adequate light.	Utilize as much natural light as possible. Familiarize yourself with the aspects of lighting that are relevant to plant growth. Browse for different types of grow lights. Position your plants and set up your lighting.
Stretching is important to loosen muscles, strengthen muscles and to elongate your posture. It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session, including before a performance. When taking on ballet, it is important to stretch daily for at least 15-30 minutes, to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up, reducing the risk of injury. You should also stretch to "wind down" at the end of ballet dancing.; , Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug, but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet. There are different styles and types of shoes, so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice, given your intentions for dancing.   Don't buy shoes to grow into, because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat. You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose. If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail. The drawstring just completes the fit. It isn't made to tighten overly large shoes. If you can't buy ballet shoes, that it is okay. Use socks without the stickies on the bottom, so you can turn!  , The most important thing is that you are comfortable, and that you're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you're forming and moving correctly in the mirror. A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet. Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate.   If you're signed up for a class, check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school. Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts. Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on.  Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them. The moves themselves are relatively straightforward, but the positing, the timing, and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice. For this reason, it's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor, who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you're dancing properly. A dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you're doing accurately, and a barre for practicing.If you want to practice at home, make sure you've got enough open space to move freely, preferably on a hard wood floor. The back of a chair can replace the need for a bar. Position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you're doing.  At the barre, you learn the basics of ballet that will be important as you progress. If you're just getting started, an entire dance practice should involve barre work. This is vital for building your strength, agility and flexibility, so do not see it as wasted time. If you skipped this, you wouldn't be able to dance. Even professional dancers begin each class at the barre.  The fundamental cornerstone of ballet, and the basis from which all your more complicated moves will be developed are the five starting positions (and the "parallel position" which some consider the sixth position). You won't be able to learn to do anything else until you practice, perfect, and make automatic the six beginning positions. These should be so ingrained in your muscle memory that they're part of your DNA.   All positions should be practiced either facing the barre or with your left hand on the barre. Beginner dancers usually start facing the barre, and intermediate or advanced dancers usually start with the left hand on the barre while practicing positions.  In the first position, your feet should be turned out from your body, and held together at the heels. Your legs should be straight and kept together, your back should be straight and your head held high. Maintain excellent posture and balance.  In second position, your feet will have the same angle as in first, except that your feet should move so they are about shoulder width apart. Widen your base of support, but maintain the same posture and poise when in second as when you're in first. Practice transitioning from first to second position without changing the angle of your ankles.  To move into third position, bring your lead foot (usually your dominant foot, or the foot you use to kick with) behind your other foot. The heel of your lead foot should be even with the ankle strap on your other ballet slipper. Move your hips forward and maintain your balance. Your legs should be straight and your shoulders should be back.  To transition into fourth position from third, move your lead foot back, spreading your weight in a backward direction, much as you did between first and second position.  Here, the positions start to get slightly more complicated. To transition into fifth position, bring your other foot back toward your lead foot, bending your ankle so your heel is on top of your lead toe. Your knee should be flexed slightly, but your back and shoulders should remain very straight and balanced. Practice this transition frequently.  Both of your feet are together, side by side, like parallel lines.  Plies are like squats, performed in each of the different positions. There are two types of plies: grande plies and demi plies. Beginners do plies in the first and second position. Intermediate and advanced do them in all the positions except third and sixth.   To do a demi plie, you want your legs to form a diamond, essentially. Bend your knees and squat so your knee forms a perfect 90 degree angle with your thigh and your shin. You should support your weight on the balls of your feet, keeping your heels off the ground and flexing your calves as you dip. To do a grande plie, you want to dip down much farther, so your thighs are almost parallel with the floor. You'll also dip your arm while you do this. As you practice plies, focus on keeping your back very straight and your posture secure.  Tendus are essentially points and stretches with your lead foot. A typical tendu combination is tendu en cross, which means "in a cross." You'll basically stand in first position and point with your lead toe to the front, to the side, and to the back.   It's common to mark the floor with tape to help you learn. You want to step a full step in front of you, leading with your heel and bringing your toe to a point in front of you. The distance should be equal in front, to the side, and behind you. The exact distance of the step will vary, depending on the dancer and the length of your leg. You want your tendu to turn your legs into a right triangle, your plant foot remaining straight and your lead foot going far enough bring your leg straight.  Stand very straight, in either first or fifth position. You may face the barre or be sideways to it. As you progress, you will get strong enough to do it at center.   Lift one leg to the side or front, keeping it straight, as high as you can. Point your feet once your foot leaves the floor. Keep both of your knees very straight and maintain correct posture. It's important to not lift your hip or butt to get your leg higher. Always turn your leg out, never turned in. Keep correct technique by slowly lowering your leg and standing in the position from which you started, usually either first or fifth.  Make sure you are balanced by testing to see if you can let go of the barre. Keep your leg up there. This makes you stronger. Make sure you are not slouching or leaning your core towards or away the leg that you have extended.  The next step in ballet training is dancing en pointe, which involves using pointe shoes and balancing yourself on your toes. It's one of the most challenging and exciting parts of ballet study, and it needs to be done with the aid of an experienced instructor. This is typically done after four or five years of intermediate to advanced ballet study.   You should never dance en pointe without your teacher's permission! In most ballet schools teachers will not want you to even go en pointe at home. This is because without experience, you may strain your toe and feet muscles. Try going en pointe for small durations of time first, and then slowly work your way up.	Stretch your muscles thoroughly. Always wear ballet slippers. Wear comfortable and snug-fitting athletic clothes. Find an appropriate space to practice. Start every dancing practice at the ballet barre. Learn the fundamental positions. Practice first position. Practice second position. Practice third position. Practice fourth position. Practice fifth position. Finish in parallel position. Do plies. Do tendus. Practice extensions. Try letting go of the barre. Go en pointe when you're ready.
It's fun being in charge, but you shouldn't get to be in charge all the time. Make sure that each time you play you take plenty of different turns, switching back and forth between being teacher and student. Even if you're really good at it.   Have lots of different roles at your school that you can switch between. Have one person be a student, one person be a teacher, and one person be a principal, or detention person. Take turns between all of them.  Pick a regular type of name, like Mr. Smithson or Mrs. Black, or pick a totally silly teacher name like Miss Serious or Mr. Stinkypits. Pick whatever name you like, or make one up on your own. Insist that all the students call you by the right name.  Teachers definitely have a style. Dress up in some of your nicer clothes, and wear glasses if you can to pretend to be the teacher. Pull up your pants too high and comb your hair really well. Walk like an old person.   If your mom has a funny old dress that she wouldn't mind you playing with, that could be perfect for a teacher costume. Ask if you can get one at a second-hand store, if you don't have one, for a costume. Male teachers should wear ties and glasses. Suspenders if possible.  Lower your voice and talk very seriously when you're pretending to be the teacher. Don't laugh at anything and call everyone "Mr. Josh" or "Miss Angela." Be very stern, like a teacher would be.   If you all have the same teacher, you could always just do an impression of the things that your teacher says. try to learn some big words to use when you're playing teacher, since teachers are always trying to teach. "Well isn't that odiferous?" you could say, when something stinks.  Keep a bunch of "school stuff" really organized on a desk at the front of your classroom, with everything labeled with post-it notes, if you have them. Write up a little name tag for yourself, or have little baskets to put all your school supplies in.   Or, you could always have your desk really messy, if your teacher has a really messy one. That could be a funny way to make school fun.  It's supposed to be fun! try to keep your students quiet and settled, but they'll probably mostly want to mess you up and say silly things, since this isn't real school. That's ok. Make a fun game out of sending students to detention or giving them silly punishments, but don't take it too seriously.   Most of your friends will probably want to goof off in your classroom. That's fine. It's all in good fun. Assign one person to be the detention monitor, and have fun!	Take turns. Make up a new name for yourself as "the teachers name.", Dress like a teacher. Talk like a teacher. Be organized. Don't be too strict.
Tabs are great if you just want to learn some great pop or rock songs that you can play to impress your friends. The internet is full of guitar tabs, though they sometimes take a bit of hunting.   To find popular tab sites, plug “Guitar Tabs” into your favorite search engine. If you already have a tune in mind, you could also search, “Guitar Tab” on that same search engine. If the song is relatively well-known, dozens of options should come up. Try to choose one that is highly rated for accuracy (for instance, five stars or 100% ratings).; , A tab is kind of like sheet music but primarily is only used for guitar and bass notation. It represents progressions as fret numbers instead of as notes. The main problem with tabs is that, unlike sheet music, there is no indication of rhythm, so it definitely helps to know the rhythm of the song before you start learning it.   Check out How to Read Guitar Tabs for more details.	Seek out guitar tabs. Learn to read guitar tabs.
Thoroughly clean the inside of the dog food bag with soapy water.; , Then, cut the bag across the top.    Sew it using a zigzag stitch. Use strong sewing thread. ,   Sew the strip along its entire length using a zigzag stitch. Repeat for the second handle.     Sew them in place, again using a zigzag stitch, to create a strong, unbreakable bond. The bag is now complete.	Clean the bag first. Determine how big you want your tote. Fold a ¼-inch (0.635cm) hem in the bag. Use the leftover pieces to make two strips, 3 inches (7.5cm) wide, for the straps.  , Fold the first strip lengthwise, and then fold it again. Center the handles on the tote. Finished.
There are a number of deer repellents that can be used. You could purchase some from the garden store or hardware department. If so, use these products according to their instructions. Alternatives to use at home include mothballs (hang in onion sacks from low branches at deer height), prickly branches (use as a fence or barrier), decaying fish heads, blood and bone meal, garlic, fabric softener, etc.Not all of these options are environmentally-friendly – mothballs are fairly chemically active and commercial options might contain unacceptable chemicals, depending on what is in them. And then there is the smell factor; if some things are too smelly, you're unlikely to want to sit in your garden and enjoy it!   Many commercially-available deer repellents include things like deodorized fox urine, coyote urine, or wolf urine. What these products have in common are that they are: (1) urine (2) of something that eats deer. This opens up a number of other possible ways to repel deer:  , This will need to be re-done every few days, or after it rains.  If this is a little too exposed for you, consider catching your urine in a small bucket when using the toilet. Then, take an old spray bottle, fill it with your own urine, and spray a little near the garden. You should use a dedicated spray bottle for this, and never use it for anything else. Clearly label the bottle!  ,	Find a deer repellent. Take your dog out to mark your yard. If you live in an isolated area, mark your own yard on a regular basis. Soap flakes used around the edges of garden beds can repel deer.
For this step, you'll need twelve pieces of wood that are cut to 240 mm and six pieces of wood cut to 248 mm, all about 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch for the height. Use a handsaw to cut the pieces.   Make sure that the width and height of all 18 pieces of wood are exactly the same. Try to purchase wood sticks that are already pre-cut to be 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high. That way you'll only need to worry about cutting the length.; , You'll need to cut 12 pieces at 50 mm each, with the same other dimensions as the other pieces (1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high).  In order to removed the jagged edges left from cutting the wood, you'll need to lightly sand the edges with some sandpaper.  To achieve the beautiful two-tone look, you'll need to stain half of the pieces of wood (of all sizes). So, separate each size of the wood pieces into two sections and apply wood stain to one group.   Choose any wood stain color you like, as long as it contrasts with the existing wood color. Apply the stain generously and wipe off the excess with a paper towel or rag. You need to cover the surface area of both sides and the ends, but don't worry about getting all of the 1/4 inch side because these sides will be glued together. Let the stain dry completely (at least 4 hours) until you move on to the next step.  Take the six pieces of wood that were cut to 248 mm and line them up. Each side of the jewelry box will be made out of three of the six pieces.   Use wood glue to glue the pieces together lengthwise into two three-piece sections, making sure you alternate between the stained and unstained pieces to achieve the two-tone look. Wipe off any excess glue that leaks up between the cracks. Make sure the ends are lined up perfectly and then let the glue dry. You can clamp the pieces into place for a more secure, tight seal if you would like. To avoid gluing the wood to whatever surface you're working on, it might be helpful to lay down a piece of clear Saran wrap to work on.  Alternating between stained and unstained pieces, line up six of the 240 mm pieces of wood on the Saran wrap to make the base. Glue the pieces together, but instead of lining up the ends, alternate them by 1/4 inch (so that the end pieces will fit inside the gaps).  Line up the short end pieces that you cut (the 50 mm pieces), alternating stained and unstained pieces, on each end of the base. Each end will be six pieces long.   Because of how you off-set the edges of the base, one piece will sit on the table and be flush with the base, while the next piece will sit on top of the base, and so on.  Glue the sides of the jewelry box to the frame that you've made (out of the base and the ends). Let the frame dry fully before you move on.   You can use some pieces of wood cut to fit the inside of the box to help the frame maintain its shape while it's drying.  Apply a small coat of Vaseline to the off-set end pieces (the 50 mm pieces) to keep the lid from sticking to the frame with the excess glue when you glue it together.  Glue the remaining six 240 mm pieces of wood to each other in place on top of the frame. As before, make sure to alternate between stained and unstained pieces. The pieces will fit into the existing slots made by the alternating off-set end pieces.   Once all pieces are in place, you will have a perfect rectangular box.  To help the jewelry box dry in the right shape, clamp the box on two sides with two hand clamps. Once the glue is dry, your jewelry box is finished.	Measure and cut the wood for the top, bottom, and sides of the jewelry box. Measure and cut the wood for the ends of the jewelry box. Sand the cut edges. Stain the wood. Make the sides. Make the base. Make the ends. Attach the sides. Use Vaseline to keep the lid from sticking. Make the top lid. Clamp the box to dry.
Two sound waves moving up and down together are said to be "in phase." When one of the waves is moving up at the same time as the other wave moves down, the waves are said to be "out of phase." Out-of-phase waves cancel each other out, resulting in a flat line of sound.Flipping the phase on one speaker will cancel the matching signal's waves in the other speaker.The efficiency of this as a technique is pretty debatable. It may theoretically work, but it's not a way to save a song file without vocals.  Each speaker usually has two wires going into it, one with a positive lead and one with a negative lead. Usually these are red and white, black and red, or black and white. Sometimes, they're black and black. Swap the two wires going into one speaker around.   Where the black wire was connected, connect the red wire, and move the red wire to the black wire's terminal. Many modern stereo systems and head phones do not allow you to swap wires on the back of one speaker. Sometimes the wires are bundled into one wire sleeve. The only way to swap the bundled wires is to splice them or re-solder the connector.  There are special digital techniques using chips called Digital Signal Processors to do the flipping of the wave inside the stereo or hi-fi. Usually the button is a "Karaoke" button, which flips the one side of the stereo image phase.   If your stereo or app has one of these, then just press it and the Lead Vocals will get very soft or disappear.  Background vocals are often mixed more to the left or right, so these are hard to remove. You will have to sing along with them and pretend they are your very own backing choir, if you're trying to make a karaoke track.   Flipping phase really affects Bass waves. So the Bass might disappear along with the Lead Vocals. Digital DSP Karaoke systems will fix this by flipping the phase on only the Vocal frequencies. Try adjusting the levels on your stereo to get it to sound correct. Sophisticated vocal removal systems or software allow you to decide which frequencies get flipped out of phase.	Understand the concept of channel phase. Find the wires leading into the back of one speaker. Use a digital phase processor. Adjust the levels to accommodate for the loss of vocals.
Soak a paper towel or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the surface of your glass tumbler with it. Set the tumbler aside, and let them dry. This should only take a few seconds.  You can position the tape a quarter of the way up, half way up, or even three-quarters of the way. You can have the tape perfectly straight, or at an angle. The area below the tape is the area that you will paint. The area above the paint will be left clear., You can also use a credit card or gift card instead.If you are into scrapbooking, you could even use a bone folder.  Pour out some glass paint onto a paper plate or palette. Dip a foam pouncer into the paint, then tap the paint onto the tumbler. Hold the tumbler by the top or by the inside. Try not to touch the area you will be painting; any oils from your skin may prevent the paint from sticking.Don't worry if the paint doesn't go on evenly. You'll be adding a second coat shortly, which will resolve this.  The paint should be more even now. If it isn't, repeat this step one more time.   Set the tumbler upside down while it dries so that it doesn't get stuck. , Each brand will be a little different, so read the instructions on the paint jar or on the company's website. In general, however, you'd want to let the paint cure for several days, then bake the tumbler in the oven. Some brands may be cured without an oven, but require at around 21 days' curing., Glass paint is pretty durable once it is cured. Some brands can even be top-rack dishwasher safe, depending on how they are cured. Nonetheless, don't let the tumbler soak or stand in water. It is always best to wash it by hand with a soft cloth or sponge.	Clean your glass tumbler with rubbing alcohol. Wrap tape around the middle of your glass tumbler. Run your fingernail over the tape to seal it and remove any air bubbles. Apply the glass paint to the area below the tape. Wait 2 hours for the paint to dry, then apply another coat.Don't remove the tape, and use the same tapping motion as before. Let the paint dry for another 2 hours, then carefully peel the painters tape away.Once again, make sure that you place the tumbler upside down when you set it out to dry, or the tumbler may get stuck to your work surface.  , Cure the glass paint. Use the tumbler with care.
The bottom of the GL1500 engine is flat and ideal for jacking up. A flat block of wood between the jack and engine will prevent the GL1500 sump being damaged by the jack and will also be less likely to slip. Don't jack the Goldwing up just yet.; , Then remove the lower 8mm bolts from the rotor covers. Don't lose the spacers visible in the third picture.  Note how the two-part bracket slots together in the first picture. These brackets sit over the top of the rotor trim, not under it. , Then slacken off the fork to axle pinch bolts as shown in the following two. There is no need to remove these bolts. In the third picture, I've highlighted the small stop on the fork leg. When refitting the speedo drive, make sure that the stop on the drive is behind the one on the fork leg, otherwise when you ride the Goldwing the drive will turn forward and break the speedo cable. Now it's time to jack the Goldwing up so that the wheel is about an inch off the ground. , You don't need to remove the speedo cable from the drive first, you can remove them together. You may need to jack the Goldwing up a bit more so the wheel clears the mudguard/fender.  The flared end faces against the fork leg and the other end sits into the bearing dust seal in the wheel.  The last thing you will be doing is putting the mudguard/fender back in place. Make sure that you push the rear end in so it's flush with the rear of the fender, as shown in this picture. Many people don't push the trims in fully and of course they fall off when you take the Goldwing for a ride.	First thing is to get a jack ready for the Goldwing, make sure it's a sturdy jack. Pull the upper side mudguard/fender trim off as in the first picture below (right side shown). Remove the 8mm bolt from the top of the rotor cover and bracket and remove the rotor cover as shown below. Remove the two Allen bolts holding the brake calipers in place and slide the calipers off the brake disc as shown in the next three pictures.  , Now remove the 22mm bolt from the right-side of the axle, as in the first picture. With the Goldwing jacked up, push the axle out with a drift from the right side, then pull it fully out to the left as shown in the two pictures below.  , Pull the speedo drive away as you roll the wheel out as in the picture. On the right side, note the spacer that sits in the middle of the wheel shown in the picture. When refitting the wheel, note the points I made about the spacer and the speedo drive.
During the late summer, look at the underside of the fronds, or leaves, of adult ferns. You should see brown spots or lines. These are the sporangia. Collect the spores from these sections of the fern using plain sheets of paper.Clip a full or partial frond off the plant and place it in between two clean sheets of plain white paper. Lay it in a warm, dry, and draft-free area for one to two weeks. Open the paper after this time to see the dried remains of the frond. You will need to separate the spores from the debris by holding the bottom sheet of paper at an angle and gently tapping it. The debris should fall off, but the spores should stick to the paper. After removing the debris, fold the paper in half and tap the folded edge against a surface using a little more strength. The spores should fall into the fold, and you can collect them from there. Ideally, the spots or lines on the frond you collect will be the shade of rich cinnamon brown. Even though this should be done in the late summer for ferns in temperate regions, ferns grown in tropical regions are different and can be collected from at any time of the year.; , Use light, high quality soil. Moisten it with a little water.   Use a clear plastic container with a lid. These containers are your best option if you want an adequate amount of humidity to build inside. The soil should not be soaking wet. Ideally, it should be just a little moist and springy to the touch.  To quickly and easily destroy any harmful germs in the soil, microwave the containers of soil for three to five minutes on full power.   The soil should begin to steam. Make sure that the container does not start melting in the microwave, though. You should allow the soil to cool for a full hour after microwaving it. Do not add the spores to hot soil.  Gently disperse a few spores on top of the soil without pressing them in or covering them.   After spreading the spores onto the soil, you should be able to hold the container up to the light and see a few of the light, dusty spores floating around the top of the soil's surface.  Place the containers in a sunny location and let the spores sit in the soil for six to eight weeks. Keep the soil slightly moist until you see small plants that spread 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) across.   If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, place the containers in a window that faces north and keep them close to the glass. If you end up using a window that faces south, keep the containers back from the glass by about 1 foot (30.5 cm). The small plants that push through the soil are called "prothallia." Note that any prothallia that grow too close together will need to be thinned out. Keep one or two for every 3-inch (7.6-cm) area of soil. If the plants are kept too close together, only male organs will grow, and the prothallia will not be able to fertilize each other. Check the soil every week to make sure that it has not dried out.  Moisten the leaves that have emerged on a regular basis. Doing so will make it easier for the male part of the plant to fertilize the female part.   The prothallia should grow male and female organs once they reach 3/8 inch (9.5 mm). The male organs will naturally fertilize the female organs, and a small fern called a "Sporophyte" should appear. None of this can happen, however, if the prothallia are not sprinkled or misted with water on a daily to bi-daily basis.  Once actual ferns begin to pop up from the soil, thin them out until the plants are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart.   The first full frond will be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) tall. Once they reach this height, you need to thin them out as described.  When spring starts, open the top of your fern containers for a few hours each day. Continue this over a span of two weeks or so. Doing this will allow the ferns to adjust to the harsh, dry outside air.   You need to give the ferns a full two weeks to adjust. Each time you open the containers, you should leave them open for a little longer than the last time. If the ferns begin to weaken during this period of adjustment, close the containers again and let the ferns fully recover. Try again once the ferns are healthy again.  You can transplant the ferns you started from spores or choose fully grown ferns from a nursery or garden supply store. Either way, the process will be the same from this point on.   The species you should consider buying will vary based on the region you live in, but if you buy from a local nursery or grow ferns from locally collected spores, you should not have much difficulty figuring out which species can grow in your climate. Within the United States, southern coastal states can usually grow tropical ferns. Southwest states can handle species that can thrive in low humidity. States in the midwest, northeast, mid-atlantic, and upper southern regions usually support woodland varieties. Check on any specific requirements your fern variety needs. Those listed here are only general requirements and do not necessarily cover all of your specific variety's needs.  The best time to plant varies by region. For the most part, spring planting is preferable. If you live in a tropical climate or in a region that does not get any winter frosts, fall planting will actually be better.Ferns planted too late in the season could experience root rot, especially if you live in a region with cold winters. The freezing and thawing process can wear away at the roots and gradually break them apart. In warm climates, planting ferns before the summer can result in plants that are stressed by the heat and drought of summer.  While each species has its own requirements, in general, you should choose a location that receives plenty of shade.Ideally, you should avoid placing taller ferns in areas of strong wind, but shorter varieties might be able to handle these conditions. If you are concerned, however, you could also place the ferns by a building or other structure to help shield them from some of the winds. You should also avoid planting ferns directly on top of tree roots.  Most ferns prefer soil that is free draining and filled with plenty of nutrient-rich organic material. Chop these materials into the intended planting site a day to a week in advance.   Most ferns have fine roots, and these roots can struggle in heavy, compact soils. Ideally, your soil needs to be loose and should not get waterlogged easily. Use materials like organic leaf mold, shredded bark chips, organic compost, well-rotted farm manure, or gravel. Do not use fresh manure, however, since the roots of your fern can be sensitive and may die if given too much fertilizer so soon.  The hole you dig in the soil should be a little larger than the root ball of the fern. The depth should be the same, but the width should be a little larger.   You need to give the fern a generous root ball as you move it. If you use a fern that has already been started in a large pot or container, carefully tip the container onto its side and knock the plant out. Slowly shake the roots out of the bottom of the pot. You should remove excess potting soil used in other containers if that soil differs from that of your garden. These soils might be lighter and may dry out faster, and as a result, the newly planted fern may not get enough moisture after you move it into the soil of your garden unless this old soil has been knocked away first.  Firmly pack soil around the edges to keep the fern in place. Water the soil well, and make sure that everything feels secure.   Carefully spread out the roots of the fern using your fingers. Mix some of the original potting soil into the root area and water it thoroughly before you place it into the hole you dug. This is especially important if the soil of the original container differs from the soil of your garden.  If you receive plenty of rain, you may not need to water your ferns very often. If you are experiencing something of a drought, though, you should give the plants a drink regularly. Never let the soil dry out completely.Throughout the entire first growing season, you should water the ferns once or twice a week if the soil feels dry. Stop your watering routine in the autumn to prevent the roots from getting waterlogged. Note that after its first full year, you will usually need to water ferns very sparingly and only if your area has faced a notable drought.  Pack composted leaves or pine needles around the base of the ferns. The layer should be about 2 inches (10 cm) thick.   Mulch can help hold in some of the moisture, thereby preventing the roots from drying out. Additionally, the extra shade provided from the mulch should also keep the soil cool even in very hot temperatures.  As soon as new growth has developed on the ferns, you should apply a slow-release fertilizer to the soil. Most ferns are fairly sensitive to fertilizers, so you do not want to add too much too quickly.  You will rarely run across pests with most ferns, but you might have to deal with a slug or two. Use an appropriate pesticide to fight back as soon as the problem gets out of hand.   For an organic solution, use diatomaceous earth or an organic slug bait. Dishes of beer sunk into the soil around the fern can also work as a slug killer. You can scatter grapefruit shells around the ferns. Slugs will gather onto these peels, and once this happens, you can dispose of them by dipping the shells into denatured alcohol. Ferns tend to be sensitive too chemical insecticides. If you do use a chemical, test it on a few plants before applying it to all of them. Stick with dusts and sprays made with wettable powders and reduce the recommended dosage by half. Avoid liquid emulsion sprays that contain oils.  When you see dead or dying leaves on your fern, clip them off. Removing dead debris will keep the plant healthier and make it easier for the fern to dedicate more of its resources to expanding its foliage., After the first killing frost of fall or early winter comes, you should cut back the fronds. Apply a heavy winter mulch to keep the roots nice and warm, as well.   Good options for a winter mulch include salt marsh hay and evergreen boughs.	Collect the spores. Fill small plastic containers with potting soil. Kill any bacteria or fungal spores. Sprinkle the spores onto the soil. Give it time. Sprinkle the prothallia with water. Thin out the ferns that emerge. Let the ferns adjust. Choose the fern. Plant in the spring or fall. Choose a good location. Amend the soil. Dig a large hole. Place the root ball into the hole. Water the soil as needed. Spread mulch. Fertilize in the spring. Apply pesticides as needed. Groom the plants throughout the growing season. Prepare the ferns for winter.
Baby blue works best for this costume, because it stands out more than royal or navy blue.   Shop for any missing pieces of clothing in your blue ensemble. If you want to go casual, you can have him wear jeans and dress him completely in denim. If you want to go fancy, have him wear a baby blue suit with a bow tie and straw hat.  If you can't find a toy horn, draw a picture of a horn on a strong piece of cardboard. Draw an outline and have him decorate his horn on either side.	Comb your child's closet for pants, shirt, socks, shoes, hat and a coat in the same color of blue. Find a toy horn at a toy shop.
Older homes and apartments are at a higher risk of faulty wiring. You should be on the look out for any warning signs of faulty wiring in your space and make sure the wiring is inspected by a qualified electrician as soon as possible. There are several warning signs, including:Flickering light bulbs and lights that dim when you use certain appliances. Light switches that are hot to the touch. Plugs that spark when you try to plug them in. Outlets that sound like they are buzzing, crackling, or hissing. Circuit breakers and fuses that trip or short constantly. Electrical wires and fuse boxes that feel hot to the touch.  You should have the electrical wiring in your home or office inspected before you move into the space and on a consistent basis. Make sure you hire a qualified electrician to do the inspection of the entire space.The electrician should check that the circuit breakers and fuses are properly rated for the circuit they are protecting. The circuit breakers should also work properly. The electrician should also check for any loose wires or loose lighting fixtures. They should replace any broken or faulty wiring in the space. The electrician may also advise that you increase your space’s electrical service capacity, especially if you tend to have fuses that blow or trip often. You may need to upgrade the electrical service capacity to keep up with a high number of lighting, appliances, and electronics in your space.  You should make sure the electrical wiring in your space is updated at least every ten years to prevent any electrical fire hazards. You may need to have a qualified electrical do small upgrades in your space and recommend additional protection, like GFCIs in other areas of your home.You should also make sure any smoke alarms in your home are replaced every ten years. Check the date of manufacture on the smoke alarm to confirm it is within ten years old. If not, replace it with a new smoke alarm.	Pay attention to warning signs of faulty wiring. Get the electrical wiring checked by a qualified electrician. Update the electrical wiring every ten years.
While chamomile can handle a little bit of shade, it prefers lots of sun. Set aside a spot in your garden that’s sure to enjoy plenty of light throughout the day., Remove any rocks, clumps of soil, or weeds by raking and hoeing the area. Go at least 1 foot (30.48 cm) deep. Then rake the soil back into place and pack it down for a nice, smooth planting surface., German chamomile is a bit hardier than other varieties. It can handle a bit of clay or low nutrition in the soil.German chamomile is technically an annual, which means it needs to be replanted each year. However, it self-seeds, so you don’t need to do the replanting! This means it actually acts like a perennial plant.  Roman chamomile does better in higher-quality soil. This variety is a perennial, meaning it doesn’t need to be replanted each year.If you want to raise the quality of the soil, mix a slow-release fertilizer with the soil before you sow seeds.  Be sure all threat of frost has passed before you put in the seeds. This timing will vary depending on where you live.In the United States and Europe, you should be safe to plant by mid-May or June. Warmer states in the southern half of the U.S. may be able to start earlier, depending on the weather. If you’re in the southern hemisphere planting in someplace like Sydney, Australia, the last frost should occur in early August., Sprinkle handfuls of seeds across the soil. Don’t worry about placement. You’ll make them into neat rows later.Use your hands to gently cover them with only a little bit of soil, as these seeds need light to germinate.You should still be able to see the seeds under their light covering of soil.  The seeds need a lot of water to germinate, so start this process off as soon as they’re planted. Use the mist or shower setting on your hose to moisten the soil. Keep the soil moist throughout the germination period, and when the seedlings are small. This will probably require a daily watering., Leave about 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.40 cm) between each seedling, making neat rows of spaced plants. To thin the seedlings, cut the tiny plant off at ground level. Don't pull the seedling completely out of the ground, as you may disturb the roots of the remaining seedlings., If you want, buy mature chamomile plants at a garden center rather than starting the seeds either outside or indoors. Dig a hole double the size of the root ball and deep enough so the base of the leaves is right at soil level when the plant is put in the hole. Mix some slow-release fertilizer in with the soil, pack it down loosely, and water it until the soil is wet.While perennial plants can be put in any time of year, they do best when started in early autumn or late spring. Annuals should always be planted during these times. The ideal planting time varies depending on your location, but you should generally stick to a season when the weather is turning and getting either warmer or colder. Avoid planting in extreme heat or cold.	Pick a sunny, warm spot for your chamomile. Rake and even out the soil to prepare it. Plant German chamomile if you have poor soil. Plant Roman chamomile if you have well-drained, fertile soil. Sow your seeds in late spring or summer to avoid frost. Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil. Water the seeds until the soil is moist. Thin seedlings when they're about 2 inches (5.08 cm) tall. Plant pre-grown chamomile in autumn or spring.
It should be a large soap, with a good firmness but not brittle. Old soap will likely break, so only use new soaps bought freshly from the store.   Any fragrance or color is fine. Get a few, as some may break when drilling.  Use a fine drill bit to drill straight down the center of the soap. Do this gently and slowly.  Tie a knot.   To help, tie the cord, ribbon, etc. onto a toothpick to pull through the soap.  Instant soap-on-a-rope without too much effort.	Choose a suitable soap that has already been made. Drill a hole down the center of the soap. Thread a ribbon, string or cord through the hole. Hang the soap in the shower.
Vinegar is a natural cleaning agent that, while it certainly doesn't smell good, sure is powerful. If you don't have a bottle, mix it up in a bucket or bowl.   Don't have vinegar? You could use dishwashing detergent, but it probably won't be as effective. There's also carpet shampoos and salt cleaners, but if you had those, you probably wouldn't be on this page.; , If you're not using a spray bottle, pour a small amount on the area, saturating it.   If you have a scrubbing brush, you could use it at this point if you'd like. You want to do it delicately, however; the aim is to stir up the salt, not to dig it in deeper. Just lightly scrub the carpet, stirring the stain to the surface.  Dab the area gently -- again, not forcing the stain down, but absorbing what's come to the top.  If it's soaked and there's still liquid left, grab another towel and repeat.   You could also finish the job off with a wet/dry vacuum. Just dab the towel on the area, pull out your vacuum, and start sucking up the salt stain. This is a good method for the smell, too. If the stain looms, repeat the process a few times. Salt can be stubborn, but it's definitely removable. If vinegar doesn't work (with a few applications, it should), look into a product that is specifically designed for road salt removal.  After you've applied your vinegar, the last thing you want is to be smelling like your rancid car on your way to work. Get the fresh air going as soon as you the stains are all gone and you're completely finished.   If it's your floor mats that are the culprit, remove them and hang them to dry (just make sure you don't get new salt stains underneath them!). If the stains are on an area that you can't remove, roll your windows down and air out the car.	In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry, clean towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Watch out for the smell!
For a tutu that you sew, you can use a bolt of fabric cut into strips or rolls of tulle ribbon. Any color can be used for your tutu, and the amount that you need will vary based on the width of your waist. You will also need to get a thin elastic measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) or smaller.  Wrap a soft measuring tape around your waist or wherever you would like the completed tutu to sit. Make sure that the measurement is not too loose; loose elastic will fit strangely and look awkward on.  If you are using tulle yardage, lay it out flat and cut strips of the fabric measuring between 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) wide. The wider the strips, the more full your finished tutu will be. If you are using a bolt of tulle ribbon, cut it into long pieces of equal length between 50–80 inches (127.0–203.2 cm) long. The Strips will be folded in half, so ½ the length will be how long the tulle is on your body from the waistband. Cut your elastic to meet the measurement from your waist.  Fold each strip of tulle in half over the elastic band. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew the two tail ends together directly underneath (but not on) the elastic band.  Add all your strips of tulle around the length of the elastic waistband, bunching them together slightly as you work. You may need to cut and add more strips of tulle if you begin getting low near the ends of the elastic.  When you reach the ends of the elastic band, sew them together using a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. Adjust your tulle so that it gathers around the waistband evenly, and you’re finished! Enjoy your pretty new tutu and show off your sewing skills.,	Choose your tulle. Take your measurements. Cut your fabric. Sew on the tulle. Continue adding tulle. Finish the waistband. Finished.
Whenever you want to clean your steamer, you need to first make sure that the machine is completely turned off and unplugged from any electrical source. Cleaning the machine while it is on could lead to a potentially dangerous situation.Cleaning the steamer while it’s on could lead you to hurt yourself, damage something nearby, or even ignite a spark.; , Use a damp washrag to wipe down the exterior of your steamer. This should be strong enough to clean off any minor dirt and grime that has built up during use. Be sure to use warm water when you dampen the washrag.If this doesn’t seem to work, you can add a few drops of white vinegar to the damp washcloth to give it a more powerful cleaning.  If your steamer has a hose attachment, you should clean that, too. Simply detach the hose and flush it with water. You can do this outside with a garden hose, or carefully in the kitchen sink or shower.   Flush the hose several times, or until the water runs clear once it filters out of the hose attachment. You should also clean out any debris that has lodged itself in the bristles of the hose., Combine 1 ½ ounces of baking soda with 4  c (950 mL) of water. This will be your cleaning solution.Make sure the baking soda dissolves into the water before you begin.  Locate the water cup on your steamer and empty out any remaining water. Pour your cleaning solution into the water cup and return it to the steamer machine.The water cup is usually located on the steamer base. You may want to perform this cleaning activity outside (or in the garage) to avoid making a mess on the floor of your home.  Once the cleaning solution is in the water cup of the steamer, you’ll need to let it stay in there for 3-4 hours while it does its job. Sit the steamer on a solid surface during this time so it won’t tip over or spill the cleaner.Be sure not to run the steamer (or even turn the machine on) while the cleaner is inside the machine, as this could potentially damage items it comes into contact with.  Remove the water cup from the steamer and dump out any remaining cleaning solution. Rinse out the water cup to make sure it’s fully clean and doesn’t have any residue left inside.   Be sure to dump the cleaning solution out in the sink or shower. Don’t dump it outside as this could ruin your grass.  Once you have completed the cleansing process, pour water back into the water cup and turn the machine on. Let the machine run so that some of the water comes out and filters out the rest of the machine.Repeat this process several times, or until the water being rinsed out doesn’t look dirty anymore. If your rinsing water continues to look dirty as you pour it out, you may need to repeat the process with the cleaning solution another time.  Buildup of grime and dirt can, over time, cause your steamer machine to function less effectively. If you simply take a few moments to wipe down the outside of the steamer with a damp washrag, this can help prevent future damage and extend the life of your steamer.Try to remember to wipe down the exterior of the steamer after every use for best results. You should also wipe the steamer down if it has been stored for a long period of time without being used.  After you use the steamer, you should rinse the machine out with fresh water. This will help prevent sediment buildup on the inside of the steam cleaner and keep your machine fresh for longer.Do this after each time you use the steamer to make sure your machine stays as clean as possible.  Whenever you aren’t using the steamer, you should store it in a cool, dry place to prevent any mildew or mold from forming. You should try to cover the steamer with plastic so that the amount of dust that settles on the machine is minimal.   Storing your steamer properly will help prolong the life of your machine.	Unplug the machine. Wipe down the outside. Flush the hose attachment. Make a cleaning mixture. Pour the cleaning solution into the machine. Let the solution sit for several hours. Dump out the cleaning solution. Flush with clean water. Wipe down the outside regularly. Rinse the steamer with fresh water after each use. Store the steamer properly.
The chassis battery in your RV serves the same purpose as the automotive battery in any vehicle. These batteries can be purchased at your local auto parts stores and usually cost between $50 and $300, depending on the type of battery you choose and the brand. Ask the clerk at the front desk to look up your RV in their system to offer you suggestions about the battery options you have.Some large retailers also have automotive sections you can purchase chassis batteries in. Make sure to tell the clerk what vehicle you intend to put the battery in, as that’s important to ensure it will fit in the engine bay and provide the necessary power.; , A chassis battery is sometimes referred to as a “starter battery” in RVs. This battery is used primarily to start the engine that propels the RV when you’re driving and serves the same purpose as the battery in your car or truck. Like cars and trucks, any modifications you’ve made to the electrical system of the vehicle may require further consideration when choosing a new battery.Determine if you have made any modifications that may result in an increased draw from the battery when starting.  Just like cars and trucks, RVs come with an owner’s manual that can provide specifications about what type of battery you should choose as your chassis battery. It’s important to look for a battery that matches the specifications laid out in the owner’s manual to ensure you purchase a battery with the proper amount of cranking amperage, or the correct amount of initial power output, to start your RVs engine.If you do not have the owner’s manual for your RV, try looking on the RV manufacturer’s website. RV specialty stores can often look up the proper type of battery for your RV. Understand that this battery is primarily used to power the starter motor, and likely won’t be involved in powering any of the electrical devices in the RV.  Wet or flooded cell batteries are the most common types of automotive batteries. The vehicle you drive every day likely came with a wet cell battery. These batteries offer the lowest relative cost and are sometimes even sealed, meaning they require no maintenance beyond regular charging to maintain.A traditional wet cell battery is likely what your RV came with from the factory. Some wet cell batteries are not sealed and require service from time to time to maintain. Wet cell batteries offer low cost and reliability.  Valve regulated lead acid batteries, or VRLA batteries, are named as such because of the internal safety valves built into the battery. These batteries come in two primary types: gel and AGM (Absorbed Gas Mat). These batteries can be more reliable than wet cell batteries because they are designed to prevent any fluid loss. These batteries do not require ventilation as some wet cell batteries may and also do not require any maintenance service.Gel cell batteries maintain a charge well, but do not offer as powerful an initial or cranking amperage as their AGM counterparts. AGM batteries contain gas instead of gel, and can produce a higher cranking amperage.  While the amperage required of your battery is determined by the design of the engine, one thing you should look into when shopping for RV batteries is the maximum reserve capacity (RC). This rating is often not provided on the battery’s label and you may need to ask for assistance at your local auto parts store to find the batteries with the highest rated reserves. A battery with a 120 minute reserve capacity means it can operate your electronics for that long without the engine running before being depleted.Because you may want to use some of the electronics connected to the engine’s electrical system while parked, a high reserve capacity is important. You can find batteries’ maximum reserve capacity information on the battery maker’s websites.	Look for a battery at an auto parts store. Evaluate what the battery will be used for. Check in the RVs owner’s manual. Choose a traditional wet cell battery. Choose a valve regulated lead acid battery. Look for a battery with a high maximum reserve capacity.
This will be the scroll's unfolded sheet.; , These will serve as the scroll's rolls.  Make a few holes/tears on the edges so your scroll will look more timeworn and medieval.  They should be sort of shaped like umbrella handles, or like grips on swords--look at the illustration for reference.  Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.  Use light, warm colors, like beige and light yellow.	Draw a big rectangular shape. Add a tube-like shape above and below the rectangular shape. Outline the shape of the scroll over the sketch. At each end of each roll draw a handle. Line the drawing with black ink. Erase the pencil from your drawing and start coloring.
Next, determine how many beads wide it will be. The simplest way to do this is to string beads, then measure the desired width against the string.  Give some thought to how the pattern will look if you stop mid-design due to the length of your belt. If you are using a pre-made belt, keeping the width to the same width as the stitches that hold both pieces of the belt together will save on wear and tear. The same goes for making your own belt, though where these seams go will be up to you.  If you do not know how to bead at all, just follow the directions that come with your loom. Actually, a belt may not be the trickiest beginner project, though you might want to try a bracelet or something of a similar width first. You want the strip to be fit from just before the hole you plan to use in the belt, and the edge where the stitches attaching the buckle is.	Determine the length and width of the beaded strip you will need. Now that you have a width (measured in beads) for your belt, use the graph paper to plan out the design you want. Make your bead strip.

Tomatoes respond best to receiving the right amount of water during the entire growing phase; too much or too little water will harm the growing rate. The best way to achieve this is to put the tomatoes on a drip watering system that measures out equal quantities of water daily. See How to Build a Drip Watering System for Outside Plants.; , Tomatoes are more prone to splitting in intense heat. If you live in a growing zone subject to high heat levels during the growing season, it is vital to shelter the growing tomatoes. Put up shade cloth, or plant the tomatoes in an area that gets shading from other plants or a building during the hottest part of the day.  Too much of a good thing can cause the tomatoes to grow too quickly and split. Compost provides a more steady and slowly released form of fertilizer.  Mulch helps to keep the water levels sufficient and not too clogged, nor too dry. This can be an excellent way to keep moisture in and prevent the tomato plant from drying out. Top up as the growing season progresses.  Ask your local garden center for guidance. Older varieties tend to be more prone to splitting than newer ones, but ask about the tomatoes available.  The tomatoes are very susceptible to bacteria and viruses once split and the flesh begins to change as soon as there is a split. Cut away from the split area; the rest of the tomato should be fine to consume.	Water the tomatoes adequately and regularly. Provide shade. Use compost rather than prepared fertilizer. Mulch. Look for a tomato variety less prone to splitting. Harvest as soon as splits occur.
This is often driven by the places you can play. If you are in your mid-teens, you (generally) cannot play in bars. The set list for a house party is usually different than it is for a bar, or for a outdoor festival. Very few places want bands that play all original songs, unless you are dragging the entire crowd into the joint (by fliers, word of mouth, reputation).; , Everybody knows somebody who knows someone who (eventually) wants a live band somewhere. Opportunities will present themselves - it's up to you to recognize them and act upon them.  Learn your instrument, focus on what you can do the be a better part of the whole. Learn to sing and play. Learn to play more than one instrument. Learn to write music, write lyrics, or write both. Let the other members worry about themselves; that way the only person you have a right to be angry with is yourself.  Same night, same time, same setup. Home base.  Ever show up to a practice only to find that the song was learned by different guys in different keys? Email and text messages are quick and cheap, but very essential.  Have everyone associated with band jobs mark the calendar for when they can play and when they can't be there - that way anyone can look at the calendar and say "yes" or "sorry, no" to any job opportunity on very short notice. , This helps find bad cords, broken things, dead spots "on stage" for vocal monitors, and helps moderate instrument volumes. All instruments should be just as loud as the drums. If someone wants to hear themselves louder, move their equipment closer to their head so that person is happy, and the other players are not suffering bleeding ears. The volume in practice should be the same as live on stage so there are no surprises, no differences in sound for the players (you will feel comfortable like being at the practice space).  You can get a heck of a lot done when everyone comes prepared.  Have extra tunes in case (the "pocket"). Have a plan, follow the plan. If the crowd is not reacting like you'd expect or hope, pull tunes from the pocket and see what happens. The pocket (reacting to the crowd) is part of the plan.  This person is responsible to decide on set list changes, and to let everyone know about the changes in plenty of time for the players to be prepared (guitar change? patch changes on the vocal effects unit?). , Practice keeping a positive attitude on your face while you play music - no matter who missed a spot, blew a chord change, or plain forgot where they were - THE SHOW MUST GO ON (there is a reason this phrase has been handed down through the centuries by other entertainers). The bass and drums should never stop when there has been a flub - ever. Practice this failure situation so it does not surprise you or piss you off - make it look like it's part of the show. You are the only ones who need to know what happened.	Think hard, be real, and come to an agreement on the direction of the tunes you want to play. Talk about the band to others (no, don't brag... just chat). Know your stuff. Practice regularly. Communicate before and after practices. Get a communal calendar that you all can get to (Google, spreadsheet, or a wall calendar). Have an agreement on how much (or how little) money the band will play for, so that any band mate with the calendar can speak for the band to play any job offered ("cool", "sorry, we need a little more gas money to play").  , Set up the band equipment like you are at a job, if you have the space. Learn your parts of tunes before practice. Have a set list for each job. Designate an air traffic controller for jumping into the pocket (often the drummer or the bandleader). Playing to the crowd is often less satisfying as a band member (you might not play your best or hardest tunes), but having the crowd jumping on the dance floor is very cool, very fun, and very entertaining to watch while you play.  , When things screw up (and they DO) don't let it show.
The Country Two-Step, or Texas Two-Step, is a fairly simple dance to learn, but you should get familiar with the types of movements you'll be making. The dance itself is modeled on "shuffle-step" footwork with minimal upper body movement. Sites like YouTube offer plenty of instructional videos of people dancing the Country Two-Step. If you have a dance partner in mind, get them to watch the videos with you. It may also help to read instructions about the steps, or look at pictures of the footwork.; , Pick out a country song you like and give it a listen. Pay attention to the rhythm. Country music tends to feature a heavy, easy to find beat, usually in 4/4 time. You should be able to count 1, 2, 3, 4 or clap your hands with ease.  Tap your foot to the beat. When your foot falls, that's a "1." When your foot rises, that's an "and." In music, this is known as "subdivision."   When you count, count as follows: 1, and, 2, and, 3, and.  The basic two-step follows a "quick, quick, slow, slow," pattern where the first two steps (the quicks) are twice as fast as the last two steps (the slows).   The first "quick" step will fall on a "1." The second "quick" step will fall on an "and." The first "slow" step will fall on "2, and." The second "slow step will fall on "3, and." , With the steps in mind, it's time to put them to music. While it is possible to practice to nearly any country song, Dale Watson released a song titled "Quick, Quick, Slow, Slow" specifically to help people learn the two-step.   Other popular two-Step tracks are "If I Could Make a Living," by Clay Walker, and "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)," by Hank Williams, Sr. As you listen to the music, think of the steps in relation to the beat. It may be easier to start with a slower tempo song to help establish the beat.  In dancing, "frame" refers to the shape you and your partner make. In order to dance well, you need to have a solid frame. For two-stepping, the most common frame is a traditional closed position.   If you're leading, place your right hand on your partner's left shoulder blade, and your left arm out to the side. If you're following, place your left hand around your partner's right bicep. Grab their left hand with your right. Leave a few inches of space between you and your partner.  Dancing the two-step with a partner is not far off from practicing alone. The only difference is the follower will be reversing the steps. As the leader moves forward, the follower will simply step backward.   The Country Two-Step always moves forward. Try not to sway your feet left or right. Maintain good posture when dancing. Don't look at your feet when dancing. Confidence is key!  , A big part of two-stepping, and dancing in general, is being either a leader, or a follower. The leader guides the follower through the dance. If the leader steps forward with their left foot, the follower will step backward with theirs.   If you're leading, don't push your partner. If you're following, wait until the lead moves before you take a step.  Right now, it might seem like you are just walking to the music. In order to transform these movements into a dance, keep it going across the floor. When dancing, progress counterclockwise around the dance floor.   If you're dancing at a club, remember to follow the line, or flow, of dance. Pay attention to the other dancers around you.  The two-step takes a lot of cues from swing dancing. As such, all the spins, swings, and turns from swing dancing can be applied to two-stepping.To spin your partner, simply lift your left arm up and slightly to the right. The idea is to guide your partner under your arm.  In Shadow dancing both dancers face the same direction with the follower standing in front of the lead.   Standing behind the follower, the lead places his or her right hand over the follower's stomach. The follower places his or her right hand over the lead's. Both the lead and the follower hold their left arms out loosely to the side, holding hands. In this position, the footwork is largely the same for both dancers, with the follower mirroring, or "shadowing," the lead, as the name suggests., Wrap is similar to shadow, except the dancers stand side-by-side. The lead passes his right arm behind the follower, holding their left hand at the follower's hip. The follower crosses their arms in front of them, placing their right hand in the lead's left. , Dancing Promenade style is similar to the traditional closed position, only instead of each dancer looking at each other, they are looking left.   To set up in the Promenade frame, set up in the traditional closed frame but pull your partner in close. You should almost be touching at the waist. Turn your heads left and use your left arm as a guide across the dance floor., Feel free to experiment on the dance floor once you feel comfortable doing the basic two-step. Nearly any posture that can be applied to ballroom dancing, or swing dancing, can be applied to two-stepping. The most important thing is to have fun!	Watch videos of people dancing the Country Two-Step. Find the beat. Break the beat down. Practice the steps. Find a song to practice to. Establish your frame. Move to the music. Know your role. Keep it going!, Incorporate turns and swings. Practice the Shadow frame. Practice the Wrap frame. Practice the Promenade frame. Mix it up!
Cut out a piece of cotton cloth in a rectangle shape; fold it in half. Sew a 'U' shape along the edges of the cloth as the picture shows.; , String the thread to make a petal, and then make another four petals linked with the first one.

Booty dancing is all about rhythm. If you are off the beat of the song you are dancing to, it will not sync well with the rest of the dance floor, and may become off time itself. The meter of the song is the rhythm that you want to dance with.; , Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and add just a slight bend to your knees. This will trigger the rest of the motions.  Start with your hips. Like most forms of dancing, booty dancing is all about the hips. Move your hips backward so that your booty protrudes out behind you. While doing this, though, make sure you puff your chest out at the same time. Use your shoulders to enunciate your chest. Make the motion fluid and use your knees to balance and push you while you do this back and forth motion.  Now when you pull forward and back, take it to the side a bit, alternating to the right and left. Now you are no longer just bouncing there, but actually dancing.  You may hold your arms chest high with your hands in front of your chest and your elbows out or, alternatively just keep your hands in front of you.  Bend your knees up and down as you do the back and forth motion. If you become more advanced, you can try methodically working your way up and down while you dance. This may be hard on your knees, but will win you respect on the dance floor every time.	Hear the music. Bend your knees. Alternate with your chest and hips. Add some direction to your move. Put your hands in the air. Bounce with the rhythm.
If you aren't blonde like Ali, consider having your hair dyed. Go for a blonde color that matches your skin tone. Consider having your hair dyed at a salon professionally, it will turn out looking better and the hairdresser will know what is the perfect color for you. Keep your hair long and healthy. After having your hair dyed, it's time to start taking care of it. Wash your hair whenever it gets even a little oily, with a good and nice smelling shampoo and conditioner. After washing it, try using a serum. #*To get Ali's hairstyle, remember she straightens maybe 7 times every year. Her hair is usually always done in someway whether it was braided overnight or turned up and inward at the ends. For her signature hairstyle, take some hair that you want to sit on the front of your shoulders and leave the rest on your back. Then curl the front hair tightly and the hair on your back more loosely, but still noticeably curly. Remember away from the face. Another style is to get a strand of hair from the upper-right side of your hair, the part by your face. Not a handful, but where bangs might be (don't get bangs). Twist it to the bottom, or braid it halfway. Get the braid or the twist, and clip or pin it to the side of your head. Repeat on the other side. When you complete this, get some good-smelling spray gel, and spray it lightly over the outside of all your hair. Then get good quality hairspray, and spray it on the little twist-or-braid things, including the clips. But remember to curl the bottom still. If your hair is frizzy, consider having it straightened.; , Even if you don't wash your hair, take a shower everyday to get rid of body odor. Use a nice scented shower gel. For even better hygiene, always use deodorant. You can also use perfume. Ali's signature scent is vanilla, so try to get vanilla perfume, vanilla body spray, vanilla everything. Use body lotion regularly to keep your skin hydrated and use a body scrub once a week. Never forget shaving, it is really important too.   Keep your hands and feet also hydrated and with beautiful, well-treated nails. Don't bite your nails. Keep them long, and use feminine nail polish colors, like red, pink, turquoise or just wear a french tip manicure or clear nail polish. Alison's favorite nail colors are light blue and white.  Alison has a great body. She's not super skinny, so don't go all out for a skinny body, but she's thin, so always keep in shape, but with some curves. Exercise and eat healthy and you will look and feel better.  Alison has a very feminine/girly style, so go for clothes with flowers, ruffles, anything girly. Don't forget your own style, but if you dress a bit tomboy like, try to spice up your looks a little bit with some accessories. Always wear clothes that show up your body. Alison likes to wear revealing clothes in a way of being the center of attention, so do the same and wear short dresses and skirts, revealing tops and high-heels, but never look trashy. Wear simple, cute accessories and always carry a big purse with you. Try to have at least one high-fashion dress for a special occasion.  Alison is always one step ahead of everything, so of course she has to be prepared for what comes around. In your purse, always keep your keys, your phone and its charger, some gum, a pair of sunglasses, some makeup that you need to touch up along the day (powder, eyeliner, mascara, lip gloss, chap stick, etc.), some elastics and bobby pins, deodorant, a wallet with your cards and money, a pack of tissues, a compact mirror, a travel-sized hairbrush and hand sanitizer, tampons/pads, some pain medication, and if you wear contacts, always keep your case and eye drops in there too. Also, keep some healthy snacks, like a cereal bar or an apple, and maybe a pen and a little notebook to take some notes. Always have your ID with you too.  Start out with washing your face and using some cleanser, to remove any makeup or dirt that could have stayed on your skin from the previous day. After that, apply some moisturizer.   Start off with some lightweight foundation or a BB Cream. Apply concealer to cover up any dark circles, redness or imperfections and settle everything with some powder. Use a brow pencil to fill your brows in, and don't leave in any bald spots. Alison's eyebrows aren't super dark so don't overdo it. Apply an eye-shadow primer. Go for something neutral for your lids, like a bronze gold-ish color, or something more daring, like some violet or pink. Play with your eye-shadow. Apply a thin line of black eyeliner and wing it out, and apply a lot of mascara. Give yourself a hairline, as this makes you look sun kissed. For your lips, you can never go wrong with glossy pink or a red on special occasions.  Alison could be evil some times, but she knew how to inspire, touch and make people feel special. Don't be afraid to say what you think, but when you see it hurts people you don't want to get hurt, brush it off and make them believe they took it the wrong way. When you don't like someone, try to tear that person down as much as you can.  Alison has a very persuasive, seductive personality, which makes people do whatever she wants them to do. When you can't get what you want, use blackmail. Blackmailing people can be daring, but that's exactly what we're going for here. Don't be too mean, because Alison isn't heartless.  Know people's secrets, and use them against them, to get what you want, when you need to.Think about what others would do or react to what you say and do, make sure your moves are perfect.  Write about everything that happens, and be completely honest. Also, hide it somewhere safe. Have a plan to give it to someone like on Pretty Little Liars when Alison told Spencer her journal was for her. Plan to give it to them if your planning to guide them.  Explore your house and discover places that no one can think of.  Try looking for hot new groups that no one knows about yet. That way you'll always be up to date and one step ahead. Always keep your music taste though.  Walk like you're on a runway. Move your hips and don't move your arms too much. When you're talking to someone and turn around to leave, always make a fun yet flirty hair move. Bat your lashes and side-smirk. Smile seductively, flirt and never yell, but yet keep your voice at a nice tone.  As Alison herself said, You're always better off with a really good lie. If truth doesn't lead you anywhere, don't be afraid to lie. Have a good-planned lie always in the tip of your tongue.  When someone ask where you've been or why you weren't at school, smirk a little and say "Oh, I was nowhere." That's the essence of Alison's personality.  They will be your shoulder to cry on, and you must really like, and make them really like you. You must be the leader, without exactly stating you're the leader. Never let your friends boss you around. Know all of their secrets, but don't tell them yours. Always have plans like going to parties, sleepovers or going out on town.  If you want to go to the best parties, you need a fake ID. Alison and the Liars had one, so try to get someone to do it for you or make it yourself.  Make boys fall in love with you.  Ali has a dark sense of humor along with her bubbly, outgoing personality. So make dryer jokes, be a little more sarcastic, but not all-out rude. Joke around more with your friends. Have a ton of good comebacks if you argue with someone.  Alison is perky. You could say she's like a ballerina, she does daring moves but always lands safely. She is very jumpy and very daring, this doesn't mean you have to do everything, but once in a while, do something daring. Be bold and confident and don't let anyone boss you around, because in Pretty Little Liars Alison is the boss. But don't be mean to people, and don't let people be mean to you. Never hold your head down, keep it right on up, and think of the positive, happy ways. You don't need to do everything daring just sometimes do something brave and cool and people will look at you in a different way. And they will begin to like you.  Ali is always on top of things. Be mischievous. Know how to make people do what YOU want them to do and know how to make people believe you. She has a very innocent yet fierce personality.  Ali usually has an innocent sweet smile, when she's luring people in or trying to get something or even when lying. She also has a very fierce and direct frown.  Ali is smart - maybe not smart like Spencer, but she is definitely smart. You don't have to be a complete geek, but study, do your homework, and keep up on coursework.  Know people and try to know everything about them. It could be useful when your talking to them. Practice your smart comebacks. Ali never gives up before saying a comeback and getting her point through.  Ali acts like she's 19 when she's 15. So act like a couple of years older than you really are. Also, if you act older, older kids will want to hang out with you, etc. Play hard to get, hard to be. If people think you don't need them as friend they will want to follow you. People will envy you.  Go to football games, be a cheerleader, do something like that, Alison has an amazing social life, So she has like a billion friends.

If you are planting more than one bush, plant them with 25 centimeter (9.8 in) intervals.; , It should be well-draining. Enrich the soil by adding a small amount of compost. Fertilise each plant lightly.  If you don't do this, the centre of the plant is likely to die back. It has fine roots that grow as high as 20 centimeter (7.9 in) and there is no main stem, so it relies heavily on moisture to keep it thriving.	Plant lemon thyme in a sunny and sheltered position. Make sure the soil is good. Ensure that lemon thyme has adequate water during the warmer months. Keep the lemon thyme area well weeded.
Take along a measurement that you have already chosen; do this by measuring the area where you'll hang the ribbons., These are the wire joining rings used for jewelry making and are ideal for adding the prize ribbons to the chain., Thread a jump ring through this hole for each award ribbon., Use pliers to close it tightly. Repeat along the chain for each award ribbon.  You can place the ribbons in each consecutive chain hole, or space them evenly across the chain, allowing space for the size of the award ribbon.  Use hook hangers to hold the chain ends firmly in place.	Purchase a length of chain from the hardware store. Find jump rings. Pierce small holes at the top of the award ribbons. Thread the jump ring through one loop in the chain. Hang the chain up in your chosen place.
Although this method will cost money, it's nothing that 20 dollars won't solve. All that you need to do is find a good book that's already on fantasy or fictional topics. The 'ology' series is a good one. Although they may resemble children's books, they have great titles such as "Dragonology", "Wizardology", "Egyptology", and "Pirateology". You can probably find archives of myths and folklore, or you can pick up just an old book about medieval ages and magical creatures.  You can get a lot accomplished by simply rebinding an old tattered book with some leather or other material. Give it a good name like Dark Magic 101 or Fire Elements Basics. Then give it a jeweled cover and scribble some names on the inside cover. Then let your imagination take over on the pages, even if it's Moby Dick, you can still make it whatever you want. You can check out Bind a Book.  If none of the above works try the following to make your own.  Any good bookstore has a shelf dedicated to journals, notebooks, or planners. Check them out. Look for one that has a cover that fits the theme of your school and has a good amount of pages on the inside. Choose one that has an appropriate size. If it's size is too small then it won't pass for a textbook, but don't go too large or you'll just create more work. Make sure you'll be able to write on the cover with a sharpie too, fabric covers never last anyway.; , Using a Sharpie or label maker, label the cover of the book with the name you want it to be. Make sure it fits the class it will be in. Remember that a lot of classes will using 101, 102, Basics, or Advanced for titles also. After you have done that, go on to label the spine of the book with the same title as the cover.  If the pages aren't already numbered, go through with a fine tip sharpie and number each page. You can get creative and use roman numerals too. Don't skip a page or this step will end in ruin. When you get to the end, leaf through it to make sure that it's legible.  If you've ever seen a textbook, it's likely to have a student name box, using a ruler and pen, create this box. All you need is three columns and a couple rows. Make one column about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) and the last two 1 inch (2.5 cm). Label the longest one as 'Student Name'. And the smaller two 'Date Received' and 'Date Returned'.  Print out pictures or information on dragons or write down recipes for spells. Make the ingredients added in. Write verses to spells or incantations and a dictionary in the back. Throw in assessment questions or study guides scattered throughout the chapters.	Use already created books. Bind an old book. Make a new one. Find a Blank Book. Label it. Number the Pages. Make a Student Name Box. Fill up the pages with lots of information. Use them by stacking them neatly in your wizard school on shelves and handing them out to students.
Most washers come with a troubleshooting manual. If your washer is giving you an error code, check to see what the manual says the problem is. The most common error code for long drain time is F9 E1, but your washer may be different. If the manual says your pump needs to be replaced, you need to call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.; , Remove the drain hose from the back of the washer. Run a moderate to high pressure water stream through it (an outdoor water hose connection works great). If it is clogged, this should force the clog out.   Replace the hose on the machine, ensuring that the outlet the hose goes into is not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) from the floor, that the end of the hose is no more than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) into the drain hole, that the drain hole is not taped shut, and that the hose is not kinked or bent. These can all affect your drain time.  If it drains, you are done. If it doesn't, proceed to step 4.  First, unplug the machine. Then find out where the pump is located on your machine. It is usually in the back for top loaders and in the front below the door for front loaders. You may have to remove a panel to get to it. When you find the pump, there will be a section that is round with an oval handle in the center. It will probably be white plastic.  Don't be afraid to apply pressure, it is a very tight seal. Make sure you have a bucket and towels ready to catch any water that gushes out. Inside, you will probably find a lot of lint, some change, and possibly some small pieces of cloth or socks.  Stick your finger in the hole to the right of the screen and make sure nothing is caught in the pump fan and that it moves freely, then replace the filter, turning it clockwise until it is tight, and then replace any panels you removed.  Your washer should drain quickly. If it does not, your pump needs to be replaced, in which case you can call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.	Consult your troubleshooting manual. Check your drain hose. Run the rinse/spin cycle on your washer. Clean the pump. Turn the handle counter-clockwise to remove the screen. Remove everything from the screen and rinse it off. Run the rinse/spin cycle again.
This is a popular technique with car enthusiasts. Heat will cause the metal to expand. As the metal expands, the small dents will pop out. Using nature’s oven will take a long time if you aren’t in a very warm place.   The longer your vehicle is exposed to warm sunlight, the more likely this technique will work.; , If you're unable to expose your vehicle to the heat of the sun, you can use a hair dryer. Hold the hair dryer 5 to 7 inches away from the dents for two minute intervals. Carefull not to touch the dryer directly on the car.If the vehicle's paint begins to discolor, stop applying heat immediately. Use wax or a rubbing compound to restore the paint’s color.  The drastic change in temperature should cause the dents to pop out. Dry ice can damage your skin, so wear gloves when handling dry ice. Move the ice around the dented area to rapidly cool the area.   This technique can be a great solution, but sometimes there'll still be remnants of the dents after popping. Additional repairs may be required.	Park your vehicle in a sunny area. Apply hot air to the dents. Apply dry ice to the dents.
Open-ended projects that have more than 1 option for a finished product are good for enhancing creativity in children. Boxes and tubs of craft supplies that do not have a single finished project pictured or a blank canvas and paints are good examples to allow for creativity.       Paint-by-number and other projects that confine children to specific methods for completion allow for less creative thinking.	Buy a craft that allows the child to express himself or herself.
Once most of your plants are harvested and done growing, it’s good to improve your soil for the next season. Take a soil sample to a garden store or agriculture extension office and have them test it.A soil test can tell you the pH of your soil and relative levels of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are important for healthy growth. A test can also tell you how much organic matter is present and about the lead content. You can search online or a local business directory to find garden stores near you, and you can call to see what soil testing options they have. At the very least, you can buy pretty simple home testing kits which should give you the basic information you need. Many county extension offices have departments that you can contact to find out if they are able to test soil. pH adjusting treatments like lime take a few months to work into the soil, so applying them in the winter helps ensure the soil will be adjusted by spring for planting.  Shredded leaves and plant matter leftover in your garden are great for putting nutrients back into the soil during winter. Throughout the fall, gather brown and green plant matter into a compost pile or bin and cover your whole garden with it after you have cleaned up all of the plants.   As this stuff decomposes during winter, it keeps some of the moisture in the soil during the dry times of winter. Even though not much is growing, composting during the winter will keep the soil healthier. If you have enough compost matter, 1-2 inches is a good thickness for a layer of compost. If you don’t have much compost to work with, you can lay it only on the rows where you actually plant crops, leaving walking rows and the edges of the garden without compost.  Much like compost, mulch helps protect the soil from erosion, temperature changes, and animals. While the compost will nourish the soil during the dormant period, mulch is sort of a way to cover the compost and keep it protected.Common mulch options include peat moss, bark, sawdust, and shredded newspapers. While you probably can’t avoid the ground freezing if you live somewhere with consistently low winter temperatures, the compost and mulch layers help keep the ground temperature regulated against multiple freezes and thaws. Mulch and compost serve similar purposes, so if your options are limited, you can go with just mulch. Otherwise, you can lay the mulch down on top of the compost. These can also help attract earthworms, which work to improve your soil.	Test soil and add amendments that will work into the soil before spring. Lay down a generous amount of compost. Cover the garden with mulch.

If the weather is nice, go for a walk. Connecting with nature is a great way to relax and enjoy yourself, so drive or walk over to the nearest park or nature reserve. If it's cold, you can still take a walk: snowy or wintry weather can be just as beautiful as summer weather. Just make sure to bundle up.  Walking in an urban area can be just as interesting as walking in nature, and you're sure to see a lot of interesting shops and people along the way. If you live in or near a city, wander a bit downtown and explore the parks, boulevards and unique sights., Stargazing can be aided by telescopes or binoculars, but you don't need any special equipment to enjoy the stars. Simply find a quiet, dark place and look up. Try and identify constellations and planets, and break out the telescope if you have one. If you live in a densely populated area, you might have to take a drive to find an area with less light pollution.	Go to a nature preserve or park. Walk in a city. Go star-gazing.
The check engine light will likely be on.  If the catalytic converter is glowing, it's probably clogged. You will have to replace the converter if you find this to be the problem.	Look for stalling, no power when accelerating. Look under the car at night after the vehicle has been running for a while.
To get the most pleasure out of your small garden, plant your favorite vegetables. Many vegetables come in dwarf sizes such as tomatoes and eggplants. Some can also be grown vertically such as beans and squashes.Some examples are:   Cucumbers Beans Tomatoes Peppers Beets Radishes Lettuce; , You want to get the maximum amount of harvest from your small garden. You don’t want to plant crops that take months to grow. You want early harvesting vegetables followed by mid and later season crops. Avoid vegetables such as:Pumpkins Squashes Parsnips Leeks Potatoes  , You won’t have the space to grow vegetables that spread or need a lot of space to thrive. Avoid planting:Brussel sprouts Celery Squashes Potatoes Asparagus  , You will want to choose a location that has water easily accessible to it. It will be quite burdensome to haul water a long distance to your garden. Make sure you have a spigot and hose that reaches the garden area., Vegetables need sun, and you want your garden to get lots of it. Ideally, your vegetable plants should get approximately six to eight hours of sun a day., A square foot garden uses blocked off sections to separate vegetable plantings. These types of gardens typically measure 4x4 ft (1.2x1.2 m).Build a square foot garden by using untreated lumber. Cut four boards into 4.25 ft (130 cm) lengths.Nail or stake all four ends together to create a square. This will be the outline of your garden. Use strips of wood or string to divide your square foot garden into 16 equal sections. Each section will serve as a separate planting area.To use string, just drive small nails into the rim of the bed at one foot intervals. Then, tie string on each nail so that it runs across the bed. This will make a grid you can use for square foot gardening. Group the same type plant seedlings into one square foot block. For square foot gardening, it’s OK to plant more densely than normally. You could grow one tomato or eggplant per square foot, or 3 to 4 leafy plants per square. Each square within your square foot garden will yield its own vegetable planting., As soon as one crop is harvested, plant a new one. For example, group quick growing crops like radishes or black seeded simpson lettuce together. Then, harvest these vegetables. You can then use the space for later plantings like beans or turnips.   Break your planting bed into sections. Plan to grow one crop for one or two months at a time.Stagger your plantings. This will allow one crop to grow fully and make room for another crop upon its harvest.  Alternate rows of late-maturing vegetables like peppers and cabbage with early season growers like spinach and lettuce.Plant each crop according to size and spread. Group smaller crops in between larger crops to save on space. Keep each row of planting within reach for harvest. You want to make sure you can pick your vegetables without stepping on or damaging other plants. You will have to weed by hand because the crops will be placed close together.  You can use any type of container to plant your vegetables in. Look for long troughs, wooden planter boxes, pots or other types of containers. They should be at least 5 gal (19 l) and at least 10 in (25 cm) wide by 12 in (30 cm) deep.   You can create drainage in your containers by drilling a series of holes in the bottom of each pot. Drill four to five, ¼ in (1/2 cm) holes in the bottom of each container. This will allow water to flow through.  Sketch out a plan for planting your garden on paper. Keep in mind the space you need for each vegetable plant. This will provide a good diagram of the different vegetables you have room for in your garden.  Break up the soil with a shovel. Remove any grass or weeds that may be present. Dig down at least one spade length (6 in) (15 cm) to ensure there is plenty of space for your vegetables to take root.Remove any rocks or stones. Add additional soil. Use bagged soil or compost. Manure is also a good soil amendment – in other words, it will improve your soil’s quality.If you have clay soil, you can add compost to improve the tilth.Raised beds and containers should be filled with soil as well. Use a mixture of compost, peat moss, and vermiculite., This will help smooth the soil and allow your vegetables to take root easier. Break up any clumps of dirt that could impede plant growth.  Begin planting your vegetables based on the plan you have created for your garden. Keep plants that harvest often to the outside of the bed. Allow plenty of space to harvest vegetables in the interior of your garden bed.   Spread seeds according to the instructions on the seed packet. Space plants accordingly to their maximum size.  After you have filled your garden with soil and plant your veggies, you need to water it thoroughly. You might moisten the soil some before you plant, too., Adding a layer of mulch to your garden will prevent weeds from growing around your vegetable plants. Spread it evenly and approximately 2 in (5 cm) thick. This will save you time on pulling weeds to maintain your garden.   Mulch will also keep in moisture. Natural mulch options include; grass clippings, peat moss, straw, and leaves. Prevent soil diseases by rotating your crops. Never grow the same vegetable in the same area for two seasons in a row.  Your garden will need regular watering to ensure proper growth. Provide 1 in (2.5 cm) of water a week to your vegetable crops. When the weather is hot and dry, monitor the plants and water as needed., As your vegetables begin to ripen, you should pick them quickly. Be sure to harvest your vegetables often to make room for new growth in your garden.	Pick vegetables that you like. Don't plant crops that take a long time to grow. Avoid crops that take up a lot of space. Select an area with access to water. Choose a spot with plenty of sun. Choose square foot garden. Try succession planting. Select interplanting. Try container planting. Create a plan for your garden space. Prep the soil properly. Rake the soil to even it out. Plant your vegetables. Water the soil thoroughly. Use mulch to reduce weeds. Water your garden regularly. Harvest your vegetables.
You can buy these from a local nursery or garden center, or buy them from a mail supply plant company that offers greater variety.   You can grow hostas from seeds, but the germination rate is very low. Additionally, most plants produced from non-hybridized seeds are small, spindly and are not as attractive as hybrid plants.; , Hostas are shade tolerant, not shade loving. They will survive in full shade but do best in areas where they receive morning sun and are shaded during the hot afternoon.  Till the soil to loosen it to a depth of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm). Amend the soil with compost, humus or sand if needed. Hostas prefer loose, well-drained soil.  Spacing varies depending on the variety of the hosta you plant and the size you expect it to grow.   Varieties of hostas that grow fast produce shorter plants. These have a wide-spreading shallow root network and work well as ground cover. Place these plants closer together and allow them to fill in and prevent weed growth. Varieties that grow at least 12 inches tall (30 cm) and have more horizontal than vertical growth can be spaced closer together and used as border or edging plants. These types of hostas are also commonly used around the base of trees.  After hosta plants are established, they don't need much weeding.   Use cocoa mulch or pine straw to mulch around hostas. These products have the added benefit of also repelling slugs, the biggest pest problem that affects hostas. Avoid using shredded leaves or other plant matter as mulch, because those products attract slugs. Keep the layer of mulch to 2 inches (5 cm) thick or less. Over-mulching around hostas encourages voles (field mice) that tunnel through the mulch and eat the hosta leaves.  These large-leaved plants have a high water transpiration rate, so they require plenty of water. Although they can withstand drought, hostas do best if given 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water weekly. For best results water the plants every 2 to 4 days.  You can divide hostas at any time; but if you live in an area with harsh winters, it is best to divide and transplant your hostas in the spring so they are well established before the first frost.   Dig the hosta plant out of the ground and lay it on the surface of the soil. Use a sharp shovel or knife to cut the plant into 2 or 3 pieces. Make sure there is at least one stem growth point (or eye)on each new plant. Put one piece of the plant back in the original hole and transplant the other pieces to new spots.	Purchase field-grown hosta plants. Choose an area in the yard that receives partial sun. Prepare the soil. Space hosta plants in the garden 10 to 24 inches (25 to 60 cm). Mulch the soil around the hosta plants to help it retain moisture and keep down weeds. Water hosta plants regularly. Divide your hosta plants to create new plants if they start to overcrowd.
Molding creates a paneled look which draws an eye's attention to certain areas of the room. Molding keeps the spacing even, symmetrical, and aesthetic. Wide molding is better than narrow as it dramatically improves your homes appearance.    Molding the top your kitchen cabinets will cause a modish and eye-pleasing also adding an extra level of polish to the kitchen.    This will add appeal to your bland windows. The heavier the moulding around the windows you add the plainer the curtains should be. Remember simpler is better.	Adding dimensions to your house is an elegant and luxurious look. Mold your kitchen cabinets. Add trims around the edges of your windows.
Adhesive picture hanging strips need flat surfaces to work properly, so remove any protruding hanging hardware that has been installed on the back of the picture.This includes nails, screws, wires, keyhole or sawtooth fasteners, or anything else that could make the back surface of the picture uneven.   Adhesive picture hanging strips (as well as adhesive nails and hooks) can be found in office supply stores, craft stores, hardware stores, and online.; , Adhesive picture hanging strips require a clean surface to stick properly, so wipe down your picture and the wall where you’re going to hang it with a clean cloth and isopropyl alcohol.Allow the surfaces to dry before applying the strips.  For each set of strips, press the two different sides together. One set at a time, remove one liner and press the adhesive to the back of the picture. Continue pressing for 30 seconds. Repeat until the required strips have been applied.          One set of strips will hold up to three pounds (1.36 kg), and most 8x10-inch (20x28 cm) pictures. If you only need a single set of strips, position it at the top center of the picture. Two sets of strips will hold up to six pounds (2.7 kg), and most 11x17-inch (28x44 cm) pictures. Position one set of strips at each top corner of the picture. Four sets of strips will hold up to twelve pounds (5.4 kg), and most 18x24-inch (46x61 cm) pictures. Position one set of strips at each top corner of the picture; position another set on each side of the picture, two-thirds of the way down from the top., First, remove the liner on the outside of the strips to reveal the adhesive. Then, press the picture against the wall. Slowly separate the strips on the picture from those on the wall by gently pulling on the bottom corners of the picture and lifting. With your fingers, press the strips against the wall for 30 seconds.  This allows all the adhesive on the strips to set and dry. When the hour is up, replace the picture back onto the wall by lining up the strips.	Remove hanging hardware. Clean your surfaces. Apply the strips. Affix the picture to the wall. Wait one hour.
Records are not a regulated market, and other than a few well-known and high-value records, most of the prices are subjective. While there are guides out there to price 1,000s of records, they depend on the quality of the cover, vinyl, and the scarcity of the record in the store. This means two things -- you can often find incredible deals, especially at thrift stores and garage sales, and that you should be ready to bargain to your desired price.   Even record store clerks are ready, and used to, bargaining for records. If you feel like something is overpriced, be sure to make an offer.  On the spine of the jacket and the record's ring is a combination of letters and numbers, such as CBS 88478 (London Calling, The Clash), that tells you a bit of the pressing and history. It is also a simple way to look up the value of the record, simply using your smartphone to check the code on a site like Discogs. You can see what other people are selling the disc for, as well as other ways to identify record's price.   If the record is worth some money, be sure to keep reading. For example, many early Beatles pressings have the same code for many pressings.  This isn't some scientific formula, as the popularity of a record is almost entirely determined by how well known the band is. Thus the Rolling Stones, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and other still-popular bands tend to be worth much more money, as collectors across the world are still searching for these major bands.   On the inverse, if you've seen lots and lots of the same record you can be sure that it is relatively cheap, like Fleetwood Mac's popular but incredibly common "Rumors.", The record jacket is, in many ways, just as important as the actual vinyl. If the jacket comes with extra stuff, like the poster of Prince in original Purple Rain copies, the whole record will likely be more expensive. While most people listening to records simply want an album that sounds good, collectors know that the jacket is a major indicator of a record's worth. Issues that will lower the price of the record include:   Writing on the record, such as the old owner signing their name. Splitting seems, cracking, or ripping. Missing or ripped lyric sheets and sleeves Torn/bent corner, hole punched (indicates it was a discount buy when originally released)., Records vary wildly in price. Most record stores have "budget" bins of records selling very cheaply, while incredibly rare records can fetch large amounts in online auctions. If you want to build a large collection cheaply, you can easily do so by picking up records in thrift stores or in the budget section of record stores. Either way, remember that the record market is a bargaining system, and you can always ask for a deal or discount to save money. The more you know about the record, the better price you can often get:   Note any defects or issues to the seller that may get them to lower their price. Try making a deal on a stack of records, not each individual one. Many sellers are willing to get rid of a lot of inventory quickly for a discount. Look up the pressing and average online price -- as this is a good base point to negotiate from.	Know that the price of a record depends, mostly, on how much you're willing to pay for it. Search for the record's code online to get a good idea of the price. Know that still and currently popular bands will be much more expensive. Pay attention to the record jacket, looking for splitting or cracks. Determine what you are prepared to spend and be ready to bargain.
Before you look into the differences between guitars of different price ranges, you have to decide how much you're willing to pay at most. Find your maximum and then work from there. Know that most people recommend not paying less than $300 for a new guitar, even if you're a beginner, as the quality will make it sound inferior and difficult to play.Of course if you can find a good deal on a used guitar, there might an exception to the $300 rule.; , If you're on a tight budget, an acoustic guitar with a laminate top might work for. They're cheaper than solid wood tops, but they don't vibrate as well. This means that the sound won't be as rich and the volume not as loud.You can tell whether a guitar is a laminate top or solid wood top by feeling the top. Laminate tops will feel and look glossier and smoother than pure wood.  It's important to consider how much experience you have with guitar because it will help determine how much to spend. An amateur will expect to upgrade guitars eventually, and doesn't have much need for the subtle aspects that make a high-end guitar better than a budget guitar. If you're more experienced with the guitar, you'll want to aim for something in the $700-$1200 range. If you're a pro, something in the $1200-$2500 range will last you a lifetime., Most well-known guitar brands have models for every price point, but some brands do certain price points better. Some brands to look into includes Fender, Yamaha, Epiphone, Takamine, Washburn, Taylor, and Martin.Fender and Yamaha both make several models of acoustic guitars that are rated highly for beginners on a budget. Washburn, Epiphone, and Takamine all make great acoustic guitars for those with a little higher budget. These are great brands for intermediate players. Taylor and Martin make many high-end acoustic guitars. These guitars will be more expensive but for good reason.  Acoustic-electric guitars have electronics in them that allow them to be plugged into amplifiers. Non-electric acoustic guitars need to be rigged with a microphone accessory or played into a microphone in order to be amplified or recorded. Acoustic-electric guitars are often more expensive than their acoustic counterparts, but if you'll often be playing in a band or in live settings to an audience, it's something to consider.Acoustic-electric guitars often have a built-in tuner as well, which many people find useful.  There are three basic body styles: Classic, dreadnaught, and jumbo.Classic style guitars are often used for classical guitar playing. Guitarists who do a lot of finger picking sometimes prefer them because they have a lot of clarity and balance between the highs mids and lows. Dreadnaught guitars project more than classic guitars. Some describe them as boomy sounding. This is the most commonly played type of acoustic guitars for singer-songwriters, folk artists, and rock artists. Jumbo guitars are kind of like a cross between the shape and quality of classic guitars and the size and loudness of dreadnaught guitars.  There are many possible reasons you might want to look at travel or mini-acoustic guitars. If you're shopping for a child, a regular sized guitar might be too big. If you have smaller hands and find it difficult to make chord shapes on most guitars, travel and mini-acoustic guitars might be for you., If you're a beginner to playing guitar, you might want to consider bringing a friend along to the store. Especially if you're buying a used guitar, a friend who has some experience with guitars will help you make a good decision.   If you don't have a friend knowledgeable in guitars with you when you go to the store, you can also ask someone who works at the store for help. The people working at the music shop will likely have a wealth of information on guitars and can help you find a guitar that's right for you.  The type of wood that the guitar is made out of will affect how it sounds. Knowing what you want out of your guitar's tone will help you make a decision because then you can look for the wood type that best suites you. Some of the common wood types are:Spruce is the most common type of material for acoustic guitars. It has a bright tone and remains clear even when played loudly. Cedar is favored by finger pickers because it delivers warm, rich tones that work well with fast picking. Mahogany has a strong sound that some describe as punchy. It is often used by blues players. Maple is very transparent and doesn't color the tone of the strings very much. Rosewood has an overall darker tone, with rich highs and mids and strong lows.  Ultimately, it will be difficult to decide whether a guitar is right for you without playing it a while. This is why shopping in person is preferable to online shopping. Most guitar store owners understand this, and they will allow you to play any guitar you're interested in., There are many factors to look at when inspecting a guitar. Of course overall comfortability and how it sounds to you are important, but look for some of these things as well:Knock on the guitar's body. An echoing sound usually means it will have greater bass, if a less echoing sound is produced it will normally sound bright. Check the action height. This is how far the strings are from the fretboard. The higher the action, the more difficult it will be to play. Look for a guitar with low, even action. Check the intonation. This means how well the guitar is tuned up and down the neck. Check this by playing an open D chord and then the same chord on the 14th fret. If it sounds out of tune, there may be a problem.  Buying a used acoustic guitar is a great way to find a balance between quality and price. But if you do buy used, you should spend some extra time inspecting the guitar before you buy it. The first thing you should do is look for any obvious signs of damage on the body and neck. Small cracks and chips are okay, big ones are not.Play every note on the fretboard and listen for rattling or dead spots. Rattling could be sign that the bridge is loose and dead spots could be sign that the fretboard needs work. Look at the neck from the side. It should be practically straight. A little bowing is okay, but a lot is not. Where the neck connects with the body should be flush, and if you push gently on the neck, it shouldn't give at all. Gently push down on the body, all around. Listen for creaking, which could be a sign that the glue on the braces inside the guitar is loose.	Asses your budget. Choose between a laminate and solid wood top. Consider your skill level. Look into some of the best brands for each price point. Decide if you want an acoustic or an acoustic-electric guitar. Pick a body style that works for. Get a travel or mini-acoustic guitar if you'll be traveling often or have small hands. Bring someone who can play the guitar if you don't know how. Consider the differences in tone of different wood types. Play the guitar. Check some of the important quality aspects of the guitar. Check for damage if you're going with a used guitar.
Use a trowel or spade to dig a hole 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) deep. Break up the soil within the hole and remove any twigs or foreign debris.       ; , Use distilled (not spring) water. You can find this in your local pharmacy. Rainwater is slightly acidic, and bottled or tap water tends to be slightly alkaline. Fill the hole until you have a muddy pool at the bottom.  Make sure your tester is clean and calibrated (for a more exact measurement). Wipe the probe with a tissue or clean cloth, and insert it into the mud.  pH is usually measured on a scale of 1-14, though the tester may not include this entire range.          A pH of 7 indicates neutral soil. A pH above 7 indicates alkaline soil. A pH below 7 indicates acidic soil.  A single reading may be an anomaly, so it's good to get an idea of the average pH in a plot. If they're all around the same, take the average and amend the soil accordingly. If one spot is very different than the rest, however, you may need to "spot treat" it.	Dig a small hole in the soil. Fill the hole with water. Insert the test probe into the mud. Hold it there for 60 seconds and take a reading. Take several measurements in different spots in the garden.
This can be done with newspaper or an old shower curtain.   Lay the paper or curtain down on the grown and cover it with mulch, pebbles or dirt and plant your flowers. Weeds will be unable to take root or move past the buffer.  Corn gluten meal prevents germination of weed seeds but it will not bother your established plants. Best used in early spring.  This is especially useful on weeds you notice in your driveway or walkway, because the water will have an easy time running off without bothering your plants or grass.  Do not do this too close to plants or flowers, or cover them up before you spray. Vinegar will kill good growth as well as weeds.  (28.34 g) of vodka with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and add a drop of dish soap. Spray this mixture on the weeds and watch them dry up.	Create a buffer between soil and your garden. Spread corn gluten meal in your plants or on your lawn. Pour boiling water on any weeds or patches of weeds you see in your grass. Spray a combination of vinegar and water on patches of leaves. Mix 1 oz.
Open several sealable plastic bags, making sure that you have one for every shade of glitter that you plan to make. Carefully spoon some salt into the bags. The amount of salt equals the amount of finished glitter, so fill the bags accordingly.You can use whatever type of salt that you like, but epsom salt works especially well for glow-in-the-dark glitter.  When the salt is in the bags, squirt several drops of non-toxic glow-in-dark-paint in the color of your choice into the bags. The paint is more pigmented than food coloring, so you usually don’t need to add very much. Larger amounts of salt may require more paint, though.Unlike the salt glitter made with food coloring, the glow-in-the-dark glitter is not edible. If you can’t find glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use a neon formula. While each bag of salt will be an individual shade of glitter, you can get creative and mix together two or more shades of paint to create a custom color.  Once you’ve added the paint to the salt, shake the bags well to combine the ingredients thoroughly. It helps to squeeze the salt through the bag as you shake to make sure that it’s completely mixed.If the glitter isn’t as bright or vivid a color as you like, add more paint to the salt and shake the bag again. Repeat the process until you’re satisfied with the color.  When the salt glitter is colored as you’d like, pour it out onto a cookie sheet, plate, or other flat item. Keep the salt in a single layer, and allow it to dry completely, which should take 4 to 6 hours. When the glitter is dry, you can use it.The salt may clump together with the paint. Don’t worry -- it will easily break apart once it’s dry.	Spoon some salt into sealable plastic bags. Add glow-in-the-dark paint to the salt. Close the bag and shake to mix the salt and paint. Pour the salt out onto a cookie sheet to dry.

Hulled sunflower seeds — those without shells — will sprout more quickly. If you can only gather unhulled sunflower seeds, collect these in a bowl and allow them to soak overnight. In the morning, toss the seeds then pour them into a strainer. Try to pick out hulls as you go. Do not worry if some hulls remain.; , Place the sunflower seeds in a large, open-mouth jar such as a canning jar or something slightly larger.  Fill the jar with water so that the seeds float on top.  During this period, the seeds should begin to sprout. Wait until the seeds have nearly doubled in size and the sprout has begun to emerge. When sprouting sunflower seeds, always periodically check them so that you do not allow them to soak for too long.  Make sure to cover the jar again.  Let them sit in the jar, in a warm or room temperature location with no direct sunlight, for one to three days until they've finished sprouting. Rinse them and return them to the jar one or two times a day until they are done.You can also use a special sprouting bag instead of the original jar. Place the sprouting seeds into the sprouting bag and hang it over a sink or other area to allow draining. Continue to rinse every five hours or so.  When they've started to sprout and look like little V's, they're ready to eat. Rinse the sprouts you plan to eat and store the remaining sprouts in your refrigerator to enjoy later.	Buy or gather some raw, unsalted, hulled sunflower seeds. Place the seeds in a jar. Add water. Allow the jar to sit for about eight hours. Rinse and return them to the jar. Wait. Enjoy!
There are a few sneaky and somewhat dubious ways around the insanity to find an overhead bin. While these tricks may work sometimes, making it a habit, especially if you fly a certain route on a regular basis could help you earn the award as “annoying passenger.”   Request early boarding or a seat in the first few rows. This is one of the most honest ways to get on the plane the quickest.       Use the kids as leverage. Even if you know your 5 year-old will board like a pro, take advantage of the “traveling with small children” call for early boarding. This is one time where having junior with you will help. Fake an injury. If you’ve hurt your leg in the past and own one of those walking boots, strap it on and limp your way to early boarding. Line up early. While you are most likely supposed to line up with your boarding group, you can get in line behind the previous group and act as though you got confused with regard to which group was being called. Fifty-fifty chance you’ll get ushered through to the plane or asked to move aside.; , You can possibly fit a full suitcase of clothing in a carry-on bag by simply compressing your items into neat, thin piles. Load the space saver with your clothing and use your vacuum to extract air. Fold in half and place in bag.  If you arrive at the gate with a bag that clearly should have been checked you will be asked to check it. Instead of acting annoyed and angry at the notion, sweet talk the flight attendant into seeing if you can fit your bag underneath the seat or in the overhead bin first. Let the flight attendant know if you can’t find an appropriate/safe spot you’ll bring it back to be checked.   Be courteous to other passengers. Instead of rearranging bags at will, make sure you ask passengers if you could slide their bag down in order to make room for yours.	Board early. Use a space saver bag to reduce the girth of your clothing. Mind your manners.
ask friends who play instruments to join, you'd mainly need a drummer, bass player, lead guitarist, and vocals. A bass guitarist also helps, as do a keyboardist, the more the better.; , Try something catchy, maybe even a tribute,your name should suit what kind of rock music you're gonna play, then draw a symbol, anything will do, even a rough sketch. If you are really stuck, as an arty friend to help or someone who's brimming with band names - teachers can help, too.  a garage, an attic? Usually where the drums are is the best place. If their already is a drum kit in school, you could bring in your instrument and practice after lunch and at break times if your teacher is willing to give up her time to let you rehearse. Schools are great places to practice as you can ask friends to come to the practices and give their opinions.  get use to playing together and become one, in sync and harmony. It may take time for you to get used to your other bandmates,and you'll need to make sure that they know what they're doing.  decide what kind of rock music you're gonna play then write it. If none of you are not that good at songwriting, then ask a friend who is or get a teacher to teach you how.  It may take a while to get use to playing music you wrote but it will come to you.  Maybe friends will want you to play at their birthday parties. At this stage it might be a good idea to get a manager, or just a friend who's organized.  Get a video camera and put it in front of your band, then play and maybe you could put it on youtube. If you would like to perform in front of all of your friends, ask a head teacher if you can play in front of the whole school for half an hour. Your classmates will love it and you'll inspire them too.  Tell friends, family that you are playing and put flyers up around town asking people to come. You can charge them if you want, you don't have to,but you can give it a try to see what you get.	Get people to join. Get a name and a logo. Get a place to practice. Have a jam of some of your favourite songs. Write your music. Practice the music you wrote. Tell people about your band. Record a demo. Once you are sure you really are a good, strong band then save up some money to hire a nearby hall int own for a night. Have fun, stay serious about your band, and you can stay in your band for as long as you like and maybe, just maybe, you may be launching a new CD in a year or two......
Make sure you have friends that love metal. The biggest reason to surround yourself with fellow metalheads is to share your thoughts on metal and learn from them but don’t exclude any of your friends who don’t appreciate or like metal. If they are your friends, you should be able to get along regardless of music preference.  Be sure to not be a jerk. Metal is aggressive, but this doesn't mean you have to act aggressively. Metal music is an expression of human emotions. Metal became so popular because it is an outlet for fans and musicians to channel the darker emotions of life.   All good art channels universal human emotions in a way that reacts with you. Metal certainly can have a moving effect on you, but don’t let that alter the way you treat others., Claiming to be a metalhead does not make you one.You should also realize that metal has almost nothing to do with fashion. It is okay to wear a t-shirt of your favorite band or a leather jacket, but you certainly don’t have to.   Metal is completely about being yourself; there is no model to follow. Be a metalhead out of your love for this music, not for the fame or the attention. Remember: being a metalhead does not mean making all of your conversations based around music., While style doesn’t dictate a metalhead, you can still look good while rocking out. Check online to see if your favorite band has merchandise that you like. The classic metalhead will have a handful of metal band t-shirts. It is similar to the punk aesthetic in this sense.   Wear guitar pick necklaces, or other instrument related things, if you can play the instrument.  There are several aspiring metalheads who get wrapped up in trending dress styles. Stores like Hot Topic can have plenty of gear, but a lot of their merchandise is for fading trends. If you find a t-shirt from a band you like that you think is cool, go ahead and buy it. Avoid spending all your money at a store like this.   Being a metalhead is all about authenticity. You cannot buy your way into a lifestyle. At the end of the day, being a metalhead is about the music and your devotion as a fan.	Be around fellow metalheads. Practice kindness. Respect the metalhead title. Wear metal clothing. Avoid poser trends.
If the synopsis is longer than one page in length, double space the document. It will be easier for the literary agent to read., When you are rushing to finish your synopsis, it can be easy to forget including the title of your book and your name. Make sure these details are on each page of the document in the upper left-hand corner.If a literary agent likes your synopsis, you want to make sure they know who to contact.  While you might feel like you should use a more interesting font, it's best to stick with a standard one such as Times New Roman that is easy to read and will open on a variety of devices.If you typed your book in a certain font, stick with the same font for the synopsis so they match. You might also be submitting sample chapters, and the documents will look like they are part of the same package or go together.  Although the synopsis is a shorter document, you do not want it to appear like you wrote it in a stream of consciousness. To prevent this from happening, indent paragraphs so your synopsis looks neat and well-organized., Length requirements of synopses vary depending on the literary agent or publishing company. Make sure you follow the guidelines you are given or ask the agent or publisher you are working with what they would prefer.   Some writers recommend starting with a 5 page synopsis, and then condensing this document and trimming it down as needed.Be prepared for different length requirements ahead of time by having a 1 page and 3 page synopsis on hand. Even if the length requirements are slightly different, you should be able to easily adapt a 1 page or 3 page version.	Double space the synopsis. Be sure to include your book’s title and your name. Use a standard font. Indent paragraphs. Pay attention to length guidelines.
If the filter gets clogged with sediment, you can have trouble accelerating and might suspect your fuel pump has got a problem. To check it, remove filter from vehicle and drain excessive fuel from filter. Use a short piece of rubber hose on the filter inlet. Blow through the filter inlet, paying attention to the resistance, which should be minimal. Inspect the screen for debris and replace the filter if necessary by blowing through the outlet side of filter into a white rag or towel., Commonly available at most auto parts stores for $20-30, a pressure gauge is a good investment, useful on most makes and models of cars. If you don’t want to buy one, you can also often borrow one from machine shops or auto shops who have them to lend. The test only takes a few minutes.  Locate your fuel pump test point, which is usually near the fuel injectors, and locate the point at which the pump hooks up with the filter injector rail. There should be a separation joint or a test port, where the pressure gauge attaches.   Different gauges may have slightly different instructions, and the location of the fuel pump varies from vehicle to vehicle, so consult your owner’s manual for more specific instructions., Let the engine warm up slightly, then check the pressure both at idle speed and at the rated speed listed in your pump specifications. If you don’t know the rated speed, just rev the engine and see how the pressure reacts. If you have a serious problem, the needle won’t go anywhere or goes down below specifications, meaning the fuel pump needs to be replaced.   The pressure should match the specifications listed in the repair manual, and should increase as you rev the engine. If it doesn’t, you need to replace your fuel pump and filter.	Eliminate the filter as a possibility. Get a fuel pressure gauge. Hook the pressure gauge to the fuel pump test fitting. Have a helper rev the engine while you check the gauge.
Be sure to use soil that permits excellent drainage as this fern does not like waterlogged feet.   Also ensure that the pot is able to drain water with ease. Filling the saucer with marbles, glass pebbles or real pebbles can help make drainage better, as well as allowing for evaporation to create humidity.; ,   Add water directly to the soil. Test the soil to see how moist it is. Poke your finger into the soil; if it is moist, the plant doesn't yet need watering. If it is dry, it needs watering.  Use a regular spray bottle and mist the leaves directly.  If it is situated next to a window, make sure that the light is filtered through a lightweight curtain.  A light feeding plant, keep the dosages of fertilizer low. If the fern is over-fertilized, the fronds can slow down in growth and may become deformed.   Avoid fertilizers with urea or high ammonia nitrogen content.  This will keep the fern in excellent shape, and ensures that the plant has space to grow healthily.	Plant the bird's nest fern in good quality potting soil. Water very generously during warmer months and in warm indoor environments. Mist the fronds occasionally to improve humidity. Ensure that the plant has access to bright light but of an indirect source. Fertilize regularly. Cut away any dead growth as it appears.
Keep track of bird sightings in your garden or orchard, either with a formal count or by intuition. Once the number of birds starts to grow, and the fruit shows the first hint of color, it's time to protect the trees.These scare tactics are very effective, but only last a few weeks.Starting too early may leave your trees vulnerable later, once the birds are used to your tactics.; , Pick exactly one of these proven ideas, or another bright object:   Aluminum pie tins Scrunched up sheets of tin foil, coiled into a spring shape Old CDs or DVDs Strips of white cloth Mylar streamers "Scare eye" balloons  , Tie a string about 6 inches (15.2 cm) long to each object.   If using CDs/DVDs, slip a second CD onto the string to sit on top of the first one.This will sit at an angle, reflecting light upward.  Tie the shiny objects onto the trees. Space them about 5 feet (1.5 m) apart, or just enough to be visible from every angle. Five or six should work for a small tree, but a large tree may need many more.  Once birds learn that the objects are harmless, they'll start to eat your cherries again. The repellent tends to work longer for tart cherries or yellow cherries — sometimes a full season, if you're lucky. Birds will spend more effort for sweet red cherries.To protect them, change the repellent every week or two.For instance, put up CDs. When bird activity increases, replace them with foil springs. Replace again with aluminum pie tins, then return to CDs.  Commercial orchards often add scary noisemakers as well. This is more effective than visual repellents alone, but birds still get used to them. When birds start to approach again, replace either the visual repellent or the noisemaker.   If you only have a couple trees, just hang aluminum cans or other clusters of noisy objects. Anything louder may not be worth the annoyance in a home garden. The cheapest commercial devices are handheld noisemakers that fire a small, loud explosive. These require frequent patrols. To save labor, buy a stationary gas cannon or electric distress signal. Place these above the canopy, one for every 5 acres (2000 square meters).	Start when birds begin to show. Choose shiny objects. Tie them onto strings. Hang them up around your tree. Switch to other shiny objects periodically. Add noisemakers if necessary.
You need a clear, un-lack camera with a HD quality before beginning.; , Tell your friends about your film project. Recruit people who you think would be a good help.  Let everybody give their own creative ideas about your project.   Make sure everybody has a chance to share ideas. Think about possible story-lines and genres for the project, such as action, comedy, survivor, horror, etc.  This will avoid you from any confuse or unclear dialogue or action movement. You don't necessarily need a set script, but it helps to have a solid plan.   Remember to plan it be carefully and be clever. What you need plan is the storyline (plot), actor action, dialogue and movement, location of film and camera anger or position. Make sure you create a believable/fun dialogue that's easy for the actors to read to avoid from any confused or mistakes.  Make sure location of film is safe from any disruptions, and be sure to not trespassing. Get a permission from owner of location or lands before taking a film.   Ask for permission first before starting to shoot. If you want to create an action or parkour film, make sure the location that you choose is safe. Make sure the place that you choose is free from noise sound.  Make sure your crew has memorized the dialogue, action, movement, etc.   Don't force your friends/crew to do any stunts or dangerous action moves that they're not comfortable with. Give your friends/crew time to memorize the dialogue.  In this step, start recording your action and make sure to cut and retry again if you experience any disruptions or mistakes.   Taking and recording the film from Android can be tricky at first, but becomes easier with practice. Make sure your Android is in the good position and angle. Always cut and switch another position of your camera to take another shot. Make sure to hold your Android perfectly! Always tell your cameraman to focus during recording to make sure your end result will be clear. Make sure you pause or stop the recording when trying to switch to a new angle/focus.  If someone makes a mistake, just start over and try again. Don't give up.   Don't be mad or angry if a member of your crew makes a mistake, because it's normal. Everybody can accidentally make a mistake during filming. What you have to do is make sure your crew is paying attention and is serious about doing the film.  Make sure everything came out how you intended it.   If you spotter any mistakes, try shooting that particular scene again. You don't have to start the whole film over, since you can edit together different shots and scenes later.  You can download any video maker from Google Play Store, and search for good options online (check the reviews). When you find one you like, use it to trim your video and merge your different scenes into one film.   If you have a computer rather than an Android phone, you can download any video application on your computer. If you need a better application, just search Google for reviews.  If you want to put any explosion or any special effects, you can download any FX action movie application from the Google Play Store.  Making a film is not easy. You may need a few days, or more than a month to complete your project, depending on the scale.	Get an Android smartphone with a better camera. Gather a team. Discuss. Plan out your action and main lines before filming. Find a place to film. Make sure everything is ready. Start shooting!, Reshoot as needed. After everything is done, replay the recorder. Start editing. Add special effects. Keep it active and don't give up!
If your car smells are unpleasant but aren’t a sign of mechanical malfunction, there are ways you can make your car smell better.   Try baking soda. This will remove odors from carpet. Maybe some food spilled on the carpet. Remove what you can, and then sprinkle baking soda on it. Rub it in. Leave it for a couple of hours, and then vacuum it up.Charcoal also absorbs smells. If you leave a chunk of grilling charcoal in the car for a couple of days, the charcoal will absorb a lot of the car smell. You could also put vanilla or another scent on cotton balls, and leave them in your car. Or you could put a container of ground coffee in the car. To deal with the smell of cigarettes, open your hood and spray air deodorizer in the intake valve. This is necessary because cigarette smoke also enters your car’s duct system.  Use a little preventative maintenance so that bad smells don’t take over your car.   This can be as simple as vacuuming your car regularly to remove dirt that’s been tracked in it or food crumbs that have spilled.Don’t let trash accumulate in your car. Keep a small plastic bag in the car to immediately deposit trash inside, and throw it away every few days (or even every day).  If you've got a problem with food or drink spills, it's a good idea to shampoo your car's floor mats or seats.   Remove floor mats, and shampoo them immediately if food spills on them. Just take detergent and water, and scrub them. You can also buy car upholstery shampoos in many auto stores. It's a good idea to test the detergent on a small spot first. You can also use carpet cleaner, and a wet/dry shop vac. Just spray the carpet cleaner on the seats. Vacuum it up., One of the most common odors in a car is mustiness. It can smell like old gym socks. Just hanging up an air freshener won't permanently eliminate the problem.If you smell this odor, especially when you turn on your heater or your air conditioner, it’s probably mildew that grew because moisture condensed inside your air conditioner. The key is to dry out the air conditioning system. You can do this by turning off your air conditioner and running the fan on high for about a mile.  You’re not going to be able to camouflage this one with a bunch of air fresheners. You’ll have to get at the root of the problem, which is likely moisture or humidity inside the car.Look for condensation inside the car. Remove the floor mats to see if they appear wet. Look in the trunk and in the spare tire storage space. It’s also possible that the air conditioning filter is causing the musty smell. See if the floor mat is wet near the air conditioner. If you smell the odor from the floor or trunk, remove all floor mats. If the smell is coming from the air conditioner, remove the filter in it. Just open up the front cover of the unit to remove the filter.  Take a rag, and wipe off any moisture that you can find. If you see any mildew or mold on the area, use a nylon scrub pad to remove it. Try not to scratch the car.   Now you will need to dry the area to remove the moisture causing the smell. You can use a hair dryer if the area is small enough or a wet vacuum for larger areas. You could use a cotton swab in the air conditioner. You might want to apply anti-mildew solution to the area. Dry any of the floor mats you removed, and then put baking soda on them. Let them hang outside for 24 hours, vacuum, and put back in the car.	Get rid of other common smells in your car. Protect your car from growing smells. Shampoo your car regularly. Diagnose the odor as mildew. Remove other causes of car mildew. Get rid of the moisture that's causing the mildew.
Twist each group together to begin forming the roots. Continue separating each root into smaller roots until you run out of wire to twist.  Bend or straighten the roots as needed so that the tree sits level.	Separate the root wire into three groups. Use the wire cutters to trim the ends of the roots.
Hate having supplies strewn across the room, creating not only a mess but also an opportunity for paint cans to be knocked over? Use an empty water case bin to keep your supplies together.   Cut the plastic away from the tops of the water bottles and remove/store bottles. Keep plastic in tact as it will help to contain paint supplies. Fold plastic down and into the bottom of the cardboard case. The entire case should be engulfed in plastic. Place paint gallons, brushes and other supplies inside the cardboard case. Slide the case around the room or place it on something with wheels (such as a skateboard) for travel ease.; , No matter how neat you are, sometimes a few paint splatters may occur in areas you wanted to avoid.   Remove pimple pad from container and gently squeeze any remaining solution/alcohol from pad into container. Keep it neat by avoid having the solution drip on the paint and surface (which could create a further mess). Dab pad onto paint smeared surface to remove first layer of paint. Press down and create a circular motion with the pad to remove paint. Use additional pads to remove paint. For latex paint, you may want to allow the paint to dry first for best results.  Painting in awkward areas can be tough with a traditional paint brush. However to reach those difficult crevasses and corners you can make one using the pad from an edging tool and a craft or yardstick.   Remove the pad portion from the paint edging tool using either a sharp blade or a knife. Avoid ripping the pad from the original material as it may rip. Attach the pad to either a long rod or a yardstick or a craft stick, depending on the area you need to paint. For example if you need to paint behind a toilet, you may want to use the craft stick. However, for high reaching areas, such as behind a furnace pipe, you may opt for the yardstick. Use a paintbrush to apply the paint to the pad and then use the pad on the intended surface. Doing this will ensure smooth, even coverage.  Avoid splashing paint or painting your drop cloth, then risking having the legs stick to the cloth by elevating the chair. This allows you to fully cover the bottom of the chair without having to paint the drop cloth too.   Determine if the chair is sturdy or light enough to hold screws. For heavier furniture consider using large wooden blocks instead of screws. Gather screws for each leg and your electric drill. One screw for each leg will do. Also, using an electric drill will make the process move along more efficiently. Drive screws approximately ½” into the bottom of each leg. Make sure each screw is drilled into the leg the same length (so you avoid having the chair wobble while you paint). Perch chair on drop cloth and then paint. Now you don’t have to worry about turning the chair on its side to paint the legs--you can do it all at once. Wait until the chair is completely dry before removing screws with electric drill. Use the “reverse” setting on your electric drill to remove the screws.  Sometimes the painter’s or masking tape you used to protect other surfaces during painting just won’t be ripped with ease (and may leave behind pieces). Use a hairdryer to apply heat to the area to gently (and completely) remove tape.   Wait until the surface is completely dry. Otherwise you may compromise your paint job by removing tape from a wet surface. Use your hair dryer to add gentle heat to the paint or masking tape. Heat the tape until it is warm to the touch and not scorching hot. Immediately (and gently) pull tape at a 90 degree angle. This will allow you to remove the most amount of tape with one pull.  The perfect example is painting behind a toilet. Getting behind the toilet is hard enough, posing numerous opportunities for you to splash paint onto the porcelain.   Purchase the special wrap that you can use to cover the item. Depending on the size of the item you’d like to protect, you may want to purchase multiple rolls. Wrap the item like you would a gift. You won’t need tape to adhere the sealant to the item but still approach wrapping the item like a gift to ensure full coverage. Smooth your hand over the sealant to ensure full coverage and protection. Make sure you didn’t miss any spots by inspecting the item or by running your hand over the item to check for any holes or missing areas.  Although you could place the items in the grass and paint, consider using a large cardboard box to protect the ground and other surroundings when you use spray paint.   Find a large cardboard box, left over from an appliance, moving or at a grocery or retail store. The box doesn’t have to be in perfect condition, just strong enough to stand on its side and void of holes that could emit paint. Place items inside the box. Either stand items inside the box or you can hang them by poking a wire coat hanger through the top of the box and using the bottom of the hanger to hold your item. Spray paint and allow the items to dry inside the box.	Contain your painting supplies within an empty water bottle cardboard case. Erase errant paint from furniture using pimple pads. Create a make-shift tight spot painting tool from a paint edger. Paint the bottoms of chairs without painting the floor by driving drywall screws in to the bottom of the legs. Remove stubborn paint tape with a little heat. Use “Press and Seal” wrap to protect non-removal furniture or items. Create a special “painting booth” when spray painting smaller items.
First, you have to get in grinding position. Though you can mix it up once in a while, typical grinding position is when a guy stands behind a girl. You can leave about a foot between your bodies and don't have to get incredibly intimate to start grinding with the guy -- especially if you don't know him.  Both you and the guy should bend your knees so that you're lower to the ground. If the guy is much taller than you, then you won't have to bend your knees very much. If the guy isn't much taller than you, however -- this is likely to happen if you're wearing high heels -- then you should bend your knees a bit further so he's a bit above you.  Now, move your hips and butt in one continuous circular motion, continuing to move from side to side while moving your legs up and down just a bit while keeping your knees bent. If the guy knows what he's doing, then his hips should find a similar rhythm to yours -- your hips should move in the same direction to the beat of the music.          If you're feeling bold, you can touch the guy's front side with your butt as you move it from side to side. But you can also maintain a distance away from the guy.  Move your arms and chest to the beat of the music, gyrating your arms and chest in the same fluid motion. Look ahead or slightly down as you continue to work your arms and chest while you move your hips. You can bring your arms down so they're on your knees or near your waist, and wait for the guys hands to land on top of yours or around your waist as you continue to dance.	Step in front of the guy, facing away from him. Bend your knees. Move your hips and butt. Move your arms and chest.
You can etch stainless steel, mild steel, or high-carbon steel. Which type of steel you etch will determine the best acid or chemical to use to etch it with.       ; , File away any burrs on the side of the steel you plan to etch with acid. You can leave the burrs on the other side if you're etching a steel plate.  Use a chlorine cleanser on an abrasive sponge, a wire brush, fine steel wool, wet number 600 emery paper, or corundum paper, scrubbing in a circular motion. You want to leave the surface just gritty enough to grip the resist material, but not so scratched that you end up etching extra lines that aren't part of your design.  The water should sheet off the steel surface.	Choose the type of steel you want to etch. Remove any burrs on the edges of the steel. Scrub the steel. Rinse the steel with water. Clean the steel a second time with isopropyl alcohol.
Let them know that the band is coming and you are interested. Chances are your parents aren't going to pay for your ticket so you are going to need to save up money.; , You just heard your favorite band is coming to town and you want to go to their concert.

If the concert is in a large city traffic will be bad most likely. If your parents can't give you a ride, talk to parents of friends who are going, family, older siblings, etc. You can always take the bus too.  If not, go buy it during a song that you don't mind missing.  Concerts are very crowded. There will always be smokers, druggies, crazies, and drunks. If you are by one of these people and are uncomfortable, talk to security and explain the situation. Most of the time they will understand and move you.  The concert has ended and it's time to leave. This is a very dangerous time. Lots of people trying to go to one place is crazy. Make sure everyone has their cell phones or is with someone who has one. Make a plan. Tell whoever is picking you up a very specific place to get you. If anyone gets separated from the group, then they know where to go.	Talk to your parents. Find out the price of a ticket.

This guide will explain everything you'll need. Take a backpack, not too big, not too small. Most venues don't allow full size backpacks. Something that won't get in the way.; , Camera, sunblock, money, cell phone, Sharpie, etc.  You'll be able to start getting used to the place.  or else they'll trash it.  No black shirts (that'll absorb the heat). Shorts, not skirts! It gets really hot and you're going to be sweating.  Wear something really comfortable. You're going to be walking all day. Vans or Converse always work.  People might try to steal something from it so be very careful!  ,, If you don't want to get into one then move aside or get closer to where there are no people.

Instead of winding floss around the card inserts though, wind the ribbon around instead. This method only works for finer, small amounts of ribbon. It can be a bit of a pain if you have to replenish it regularly.	Use an embroidery container with plastic or paper card inserts.
They should work well together and enjoy healthy competition. However, they should respect each other at all times.  With team goals, come team incentives, so make sure everyone is interested in the incentive.  Goals rely on accurate benchmarks and reporting., A team can work with these to cover all their bases and present a united front.  A social drink or dinner occasionally will encourage people to support each other and strive for large goals., If someone isn’t performing, give them a chance to rectify it. However, if they don’t work hard or mesh well, tactfully reassign them.  Ideally, this person should be willing to accept some risk and reward for their extra work.  When you’ve created a high-performance team, they will become empowered by some independence. Rethink this if performance falls.	Pick an “A” team. Create collaborative goals as well as individual goals. Let the entire team know how success will be measured. Be honest about strengths and weaknesses. Encourage the team to bond. Cut someone from the team when necessary. Choose a leader or let the team naturally chose a leader. Let the teamwork independently without too much micromanaging.
Most varieties can be grown in pots, but larger tomatoes will need larger containers. Tomato plants are also significantly easier to grow by transplant, rather than by seed.; , Most tomato plants require a 15-gallon (60-liter), 18-inch (46-centimeter) pot in order to have adequate room to develop. Some small varieties may fit inside a 12-inch (30.5-centimeter) pot, but the roots will be restricted and your yield may not be very impressive.  Sturdy clay pots may look nice, but a pot this large will get very heavy and you will not be able to move it without some strain. As a result, plastic pots with drainage holes and saucers may work best.  This step is crucial if your pot once held another plant, since it may have left bacteria and microscopic insect eggs behind. At minimum, you should wash the pot out with hot water and soap. You can also use a little bleach for a more thorough cleansing.  Never use garden soil, which may contain harmful pests and bacteria that can damage tomatoes, which are susceptible to disease. An all-purpose potting soil provides an excellent base, but you can also mix it with equal parts perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and compost to improve drainage and provide additional nutrition. Make sure that any compost you use has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill off potentially harmful organisms.  You can use a commercial fertilizer safe for vegetables, or you can mix in organic fertilizing components, including soy meal, blood meal, bone meal, kelp meal, and greensand.   Organic fertilizing components can purchased online, and a few common types, like blood meal and bone meal, can usually be found in big chain garden and home improvement stores, as well as specialized nurseries. Feed stores that sell food for livestock may also carry a few organic components, like kelp meal.	Obtain a healthy tomato plant. Use a large pot with drainage holes. Be mindful about material. Scrub your pot clean. Prepare your potting mix. Mix fertilizers into the soil.
Choose a shoe with a flexible, thin sole for the dance floor. Stay away from platform shoes; that thick sole and heel make it difficult to feel the floor. Be sure, too, that your feet feel secure in you shoes. Backless sandals are best left at home. Do not wear sneakers or other shoes with rubbery or sticky soles or be prepared to pick up your feet. At best, you'll risk looking a bit herky-jerky in your movements; at worst you may find yourself with a twisted ankle or tweaked-out knee.  Tight satin might look (and feel) great, but it could inhibit your moves on the dance floor, and one wrong move could leave you with an embarrassing rip. Stay away, too, from tops or shirts that fit low in the armhole; they make it harder to move. Try on your outfit at home to be sure you can dance with ease.  If you tend to perspire, choose garments made of natural fibers. Tank tops and halter tops can look great, but sweaty or clammy skin could be a turn off if a partner asks you to dance. Drop a pack of moist towelettes and a travel-size powder in your pocket so you can freshen up when needed.	Put on your boogie shoes. Make sure you can move. Be prepared for the heat.

If you and your friends share the same taste in music, this shouldn’t be too hard. Maybe you also know someone who has taken a class in the past who can give you some tips.   You can also ask around, post a facebook or twitter status, or gather friends who you know are up for anything. You should never be too forceful with your friends. If they are too uncomfortable, no one will have any fun. This might mean that you aren’t dancing with your closest friends, but rather your friends who are the most up for dancing. That’s okay! You can have more than one type of friend.  If you or one of your friends has previous experience with dancing, this can be very valuable to the group. The best thing about doing things in a group is that you suddenly have the knowledge of multiple people.  There are multiple ways to dance in a group, so decide on the one that best fits the group that you have.   There plenty of group routines that you can copy just by watching videos. If you want to do something more formal, like a performance, this would be the way to go. Maybe you just want to dance as a group in a club. In that case, it would be better for you all to learn hip hop moves or solo routines, so that you can switch off. There are plenty of youtube videos for individual moves that you can learn together. , You don’t have to wait until everybody is 100% confident in him or herself. That’s the beauty of working in a group! You always have everyone’s support and the knowledge that everyone you are with wants to dance with you too.	Gather friends who you know are interested. Pool your knowledge. Decide on a style. Take the clubs by storm!
In order to increase the amount of water released with each flush, you’ll need to have access to the tank. Shut off the water supply, remove the lid and hit the plunger to drain the tank. Once this is done, you’ll be able to work unobstructed.Do not attempt to change your toilet’s fill level while there’s still water in the tank.  On most standard toilets, this will appear as a large upright tube positioned on one side of the tank. This is the part that controls how much water enters the tank when the toilet refills. Your toilet’s fill valve will most likely have either a ballcock or floating cylinder construction—both can be tweaked manually in just a couple of minutes.Ballcock valves make use of a floating rubber ball to gauge the water level, while cylinder valves can be set to designate the cutoff point.If there’s any obvious damage to your toilet’s fill valve, the wisest option is to simply purchase a new one.  If your toilet uses a ballcock design with a floating rubber ball attached to a separate arm, you can manually adjust the water level by twisting the stem at the top of the arm counterclockwise. If it uses a newer sliding cylinder construction, simply pinch the clips on the edge of the cylinder and raise or lower it to the desired height.You may need to use a screwdriver, coin or some other slender object to change the position of a ballcock stem.Take note of the normal water level, as indicated by hard water discoloration. This will give you an idea how much water is typically needed to achieve a satisfactory flush. On some newer toilets, the manufacturers specify the optimal fill level with a line etched on the interior wall of the tank., Turn the water supply to the toilet back on and wait for the tank to refill. Lift the toilet seat and flush. If you’re satisfied with the flush, replace the toilet tank lid and continue using your toilet as usual. If not, continue adjusting the height of the fill valve to improve the flushing power to your liking.   It may take you a few unsuccessful tries before you finally get the water level exactly where you want it. Be careful not to set your toilet tank to overfill. This will cause it to run incessantly in an effort to drain excess water, which is wasteful and expensive.	Empty the toilet tank. Locate the fill valve. Reset the height of the fill valve. Test the toilet’s flush.
Open all of your car doors one-by-one, and take your mats out of the car, if they are removable. Do not clean them while they are still inside the car.You want to remove the mats so that you won't get water damage in your car’s interior. Also, you should not allow oily or foam consistency products to come in contact with the gas, clutch and brake pedals in your car as this could cause your foot to slip off the pedal during driving, which is dangerous. Clean the mats outside. You can clean the mats at a gas station or at home in your parking lot or inside your garage. Most car mats are removable. However, occasionally the mats are built into the car. In those cases, you will have to clean them inside the car.; , Use a vacuum to ensure that you suction up all of the dust particles and soil specks from your car mats before you try to clean them further.   Cleaning a damp carpet mat can be difficult. You could use baking soda to absorb some moisture and foul odor by lightly sprinkling it onto the carpet floor mat and then leaving it to sit for about 10-20 minutes, before vacuuming. Vacuum the mats on both sides, making sure to thoroughly get crumbs and dust off of them. , This will shake out some of the dust that is embedded in the rubber or cloth floor mats. Do this outside.   Give the mat a couple of whacks against the ground. Find a hard surface to strike the mats against. This works for rubber and cloth mats. You might also want to use a scraper to remove hardened materials from the rubber mat before cleaning it.	Remove your floor mats, whether rubber or cloth, from your car, if possible. Vacuum cloth floor mats first. Shake or whack the mats to remove dirt.
When substances build up around the teeth of your zipper, it can prevent the zipper from staying closed. As a result, you’ll need to clean the teeth and remove stuff that could be preventing the zipper from closing.          Combine water and soap in a small dish, and stir until suds form. Dip a clean rag in the soapy water and wipe down the zipper’s teeth. Grab a fresh rag and run it under the tap. Wipe the soapy mixture off the teeth with the damp rag. Attempt to zip and unzip as normal., If all else fails, you may need to fix bent teeth to get your zipper to close. To do this, use your tool of choice (perhaps pliers) to pull the tooth straight.          Repeat as needed. Be careful not to pull the tooth out of the tape. Test the repair by opening and closing the zipper as normal., Move the slider towards the bottom of the zipper without pulling it off. Straighten and align the zipper’s teeth with your fingers. Slowly feed the zipper into the slider. You may need to apply a little force. Make sure the side of the zipper moves down all the way into the bottom stopper.          You may need to repeat this several times.	Remove buildup from a zipper’s teeth. Straighten bent teeth. Resecure the zipper and the teeth.
Do this by grasping the stem in one hand and the flower part in the other and pulling in opposite directions.  Some can be stubborn, so tug hard.  They will come apart, and small plastic pieces such as stamens will fall out.  Keep these little pieces to use later.   Look inside and you will see a tiny hole where the flower was once attached.  The two pipe cleaners might be a tight fit, but the chenille will flatten and they will go through the hole.  This makes the skirt, repeat with up to two more blossoms for a fuller skirt.   Push the skirt to approximately half way on the pipe cleaners and allow the two "body" beads to rest against the skirt.  Thread on a small flower part to act as the collar.,  Thread on another small blossom for a hat.  Cut 1" off the ends of the arms.  Thread the small plastic flower pieces that fell off when you took the flower apart onto each of the arms as bracelets.,  Separate the two pipe cleaners and bend one down until it touches the head bead to form a loop.  Wrap the other piece tightly around the base of the loop to secure it.  Thread a 12" piece of curling ribbon through the loop and tie for a hanger.   Bend back the ends and twist to form feet.  Bend the feet upward.,  She will make you smile.  Draw on a face with fine line Sharpie.  Her perky little skirt will never need pressing.	Begin by pulling apart three silk flowers with large, full blossoms. Hold two pipe cleaners together and with one of the large blossoms upside down, thread the blossom onto the pipe cleaner. Thread two 1" wooden beads from the top onto the two pipe cleaners. Continue working from the top and add one more 1" wooden bead for the head. Hold another pipe cleaner horizontally under the head bead and twist twice to secure it to make the arms. Return to the top and create a hook for hanging the flower lady. Separate the two legs and thread on tiny flowers for ankle bracelets. Hang your petal girl where she will be seen as you pass through a room.
Decide which branch(es) you will cut and where. You may wish to cut a branch for aesthetic reasons (because it overhangs something or grows in a direction it shouldn't) or because branches are rubbing or damaged.   If you have any doubts about which branches to cut or how to cut them safely, hire a tree service.  Prune branches smaller than about 5cm (2 inches) in diameter with bypass loppers. Use the technique below for larger branches.; , This cut should be made at ‘A’ in the picture above. ,,   Don't cut into the "branch collar" of the limb being removed. This will actually inhibit healing. Search "branch collar" images on your browser if you have trouble seeing it. The branch collar can be identified on most trees as a bulge where the limb meets the trunk but can be hard to see on young trees or trees that grow slowly.   Save your money, use clean, sharp tools and don't paint the cut. At one time it was common practice to paint tree cuts, but it's been shown to harm trees more than help.Leave the wound free to dry naturally.	Plan your cut. Cut the limb from the underside about 1/2 way through but stop before the saw binds. Make a second cut at ‘B’, slightly further out on the limb and from the top.  , Allow the branch to break free and fall under its own weight.  , Cut the remaining stub off from ‘E’ to ‘F’,(to prevent tearing the bark make a small cut at 'F' first) make the cut close to the main trunk. Cut flush with the outer edge of the branch collar, and healing will proceed much faster.
Sometimes stadiums or music venues will put out job ads for a large event that they are having. Having this experience may open the doors for you to apply to future positions if you do well. Visit popular job boards like Craigslist and Indeed and search for tour roadie or crew member jobs. Alternatively, you can look up positions at local theaters like production assistant or stage crew and get experience with a local theater.   Jobs that are available at venues or stadiums include janitorial staff, lighting and sound engineers, event planners, security, set up and break down crews, ticket cashiers, and food staff.Sometimes when venues need general help they won't require any previous experience. Look for venues that need help as soon as possible as they will be more likely to hire someone with no experience.  There are several roadie specific job boards that contain listings for jobs related to roadies. Sometimes these websites will require you to create an account before you can view open positions.Make sure that you have an updated resume and choose jobs that meet your level of experience.   Some of the most popular roadie specific job boards include, Roadiejobs.com and Crewspace.com.  Try to find the contact information of your favorite band on their website, or look for the manager's information and contact them to see if they need any help on the road. Long hours and intense travel mean that many people can't live the roadie lifestyle. For this reason, you may be able to get a job on the road with your favorite band even if it seems unrealistic.   You can search for band's contact information using popular search engines, however many times response rates are low.Try reaching out to the band or crew manager via social media to see if there are any job openings.  Talk to friends that are involved in the music industry and ask them if they know of any jobs that are available in the field. If you know bar or venue owners, they may be able to make an exception for you and provide you a job with no experience. If you went for your formal education, past teachers or mentors could also point you in the right direction.   You can say something like, "I'm having a hard time finding a job. Do you know of anyone that needs a good lighting person right now?"  , Once you have the proper experience in the field that you enjoy, try to develop a team of crew members. Select people that have experience and knowledge in places that you don't. Many people are looking for lighting, sound, or visual technicians and will regularly contract work out to them.Create a business page and a website so that venues and bands can reach out to you. Network with existing contacts to see if there's anyone that's in search of your skills. Once you get a couple of jobs under your belt, see if your prior customers can refer you to other businesses that need your services. If you have a reliable and knowledgeable crew, it will be easy to take on projects that require a lot of different types of work. You may also want to obtain a business license for your crew. Since you won't always be on tour, you'll need to be able to supplement your tour work with work that you can do while you're off-tour. The more jobs you get as a freelancer the more reputable your work will become.	Apply to gigs at music venues or stadiums. Search for job openings on roading-specific job boards. Reach out to your favorite bands to see if they need help. Use your networking connections to get a job. Set up your own crew and do contract work.
A car's radiator needs bleeding for the same reason that a home's radiator does - pockets of air have become trapped in the car's cooling system. This prevents antifreeze from circulating effectively, causing the car to overheat. If you observe one or more of the following symptoms, your car's radiator may need bleeding:   Abnormally high temperature readings on your dashboard temperature meter. Fluid boiling out of your radiator. Odd smells from your engine, especially sweet smells (caused by antifreeze leaking and/or burning up.) Additionally, it can be a good idea to bleed your radiator after performing maintenance or part replacement on your cooling system. Air can be introduced to the system during maintenance work - keep an eye on your temperature gauge after modifying your cooling system in any way.  Some cars have bleeder valves incorporated into the cooling system which function by releasing trapped air, just like the bleeder valves on a home radiator. Consult your owner's manual to find the precise location of this valve - usually it's located at your cooling system's highest point to most effectively release air, which naturally rises.   To bleed a car's radiator via a bleeder valve, simply loosen it until you hear the hissing sound of air escaping. Use a cloth to catch any sputtering coolant, then re-tighten the valve when the valve releases a steady stream of coolant. Some cars don't have special bleeder valves. Don't worry - it's still possible to bleed these cars' radiators via other processes (see below.)  , Another easy way to bleed the car's radiator is simply to allow it to idle with the radiator cap removed (this is also a great option if your car doesn't come equipped with a special bleeder valve.) Remove the radiator cap, then allow your car to run for about fifteen to twenty minutes. The air pockets should be forced through the cooling system and bubble out of the car's radiator.  Air naturally rises, so by raising the front of your car, putting the radiator at a higher point than the rest of your cooling system, you can speed the release of air from your system. Carefully use a jack to raise your car - most cars come with one, but if yours didn't, they're available at auto supply stores. Ensure your radiator cap is loosened or removed before lifting the car.   In certain special car varieties, the radiator may not be located at the front of the car - consult your car's owner's manual if you're not sure.  After you've bled a car's radiator, it can be a good idea to add new coolant. Trapped air can artificially inflate a car's coolant reading - you may be running low on coolant without having realized it. Drain old coolant from your system and add fresh coolant, observing any special instruction in your owner's manual. Below are general instructions for replacing your car's coolant:   Allow the engine to cool completely. Place a drainage pan under your radiator's drain valve to collect old coolant. Add water to the car's radiator until it's full, then allow it to drain out of the drain valve under the car. Close the drain valve and add fresh coolant, generally a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and distilled water (not tap water, which can form mineral deposits.) Bleed your radiator again to eliminate any air introduced during the flush and fill.	Look for symptoms that your car's radiator isn't working. Locate and loosen your car's bleeder valve. Start the car with the radiator cap off. Elevate your car. Perform a "flush and fill."
Fruits never contain gluten (since they are free of wheat products), and make great snacks.If you’re not in a hurry, buy a selection: apples, peaches, plums, nectarines, and grapes can be eaten in any situation, and provide plenty of healthy vitamins. You can also purchase dried versions of most popular fruits, which are well suited for eating in a car or at work.  Most supermarkets will stock dried apricots, raisins, and dried mango, among other dried fruits.; , Like fruits, vegetables will never contain gluten, and so are a reliable snacking option. Carrot sticks, celery, sliced bell peppers, and broccoli are a few popular vegetable snacks.If you’d rather not eat your vegetables plain, you can easily find a gluten-free dip to eat them with.  Pairing vegetables with hummus, nut butters, flavored cream dips, salad dressing, or chunks of cheese can offer healthy gluten-free snack options. Whole fruits, nuts, rice cakes, and salads are healthy, filling, and often gluten-free.  These products are typically gluten free, since they do not contain wheat or any grain products or byproducts. Nuts can be found in either salted or non-salted variety; either makes for a tasty snack.If you have access to a large grocery store, you should be able to find plenty of varieties of nuts: peanuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds are a few popular varieties of nut.  Rice cakes are generally light and low on calories, and can be found in a variety of flavors.  Meat does not contain gluten, so look for snacks that contain meat and minimal added ingredients.Jerky is by far the most popular meat-based snack (followed by the “slim jim” style of long, thin sticks of processed meat). Beef and turkey jerky are the two most common types of jerky, and can typically be found in the snack aisle of a grocery store. These products are gluten free, as long as they have not had a flavoring added which contains gluten (e.g. soy sauce or teriyaki).  Specialty stores or natural-foods supermarkets may carry an even larger variety of jerky, including animals like buffalo, bison, or ostrich. These are likely to cost more, though.	Buy fresh or dried fruits. Snack on vegetables and gluten-free dips. Shop for nuts and rice cakes. Find jerky or other meat-based snacks.
Paying attention to the traffic around you, frequently surveying your mirrors, and anticipating what other drivers are going to do is the most important step to becoming a courteous and safe driver.; , This is no 1950s drag race. Proving your need for speed leads to dangerous circumstances between your car and other cars. You should almost always be in the right-most lane, except when passing others. The exceptions would be if you are anticipating a left turn, or a left-sided exit on the expressway. Staying in the right-most lane will allow others traveling faster than you to get around you safely and avoid them having to pass you on the right side, which is discouraged as it is not as safe a maneuver.  Notify other drivers of your intent to turn or to change lanes early enough that they are able to take appropriate action. Sitting at a red light is NOT the right time to turn on your blinker; if you had done so earlier, the person behind you would have been able to change lanes and avoid sitting behind you when the light turns green.  Also, time your entry into an intersection so that you don't get caught blocking it once the light turns red (i.e. "don't block the box").  If the light turns yellow and you have enough space to stop safely, then stop. Cyclists, pedestrians, and even other drivers expect you to be completely stopped by the time the light turns red. You endanger yourself and others by running yellow lights, only to save a minute or two, it simply isn't worth it.  Do not, however, suddenly slam the brakes in moving traffic in order to let a driver enter. This will most likely lead to a fender bender or worse, a collision from the unsuspecting driver behind you. This occurred at least once, killing the driver who drove behind the car that had suddenly braked in constantly moving traffic. Drivers in moving traffic never expect a sudden brake. Be extremely careful.  You should keep at least 2 to 4 seconds distance between you and the person in front of you. You can use the signs or the paint dashes to judge this distance. Perhaps if the vehicle in front suddenly stalls or stops, you as a driver have enough room to stop safely, or turn into the next lane without causing a backup in traffic. Other weather-related conditions, such as snow and rain, also make it wise to prevent collisions by keeping a safe distance behind for slippery, sliding and swerving cars.  Their minds focus on retrieving their ball in the street or catching up to friends by suddenly crossing roads on bikes, for instance. When driving through residential streets, be wary of unpredictable objects and people in the streets.  When passing a semi-truck, keep in mind that the truck driver has more difficulty braking. It is best to wait until you can see the truck in your rear-view mirror before completing a pass. Also avoid remaining beside a truck when in multi-lane traffic, if you cannot see the truck driver through his/her mirror, then he/she cannot see you.  Senior citizens need to drive just like everyone else. This is especially the case when they have no other means to obtain essentials. Most senior citizens, however, tend to prefer driving during early afternoons when there is less traffic and more daylight. When driving behind a senior citizen, always keep a safe distance and watch for unexpected moves, such as lane changes. Some seniors may change lanes without prior signaling.  Odds are there's an accident, stalled car, or on the shoulder someone is pulled over, broken down car etc. By doing so you make yourself less prone to be in a secondary accident and it helps people who are in a dangerous or bad situation.  Accidents happen, but you can take a few steps to prevent many of them from occurring, either to yourself or others. By understanding the way various drivers react, you will have a better grasp of how to be a better driver. The best drivers learn to anticipate possible changes in traffic, and prepare for them in advance by adjusting their speed, their lane/direction, or where their attention is directed.  It will depend on what you did and the traffic conditions as to the offense. Not all officers are out to write tickets.  You will get nailed no matter how many cars you pass.	Focus. Allow someone to pass, if you happen to see them going beyond the speed limit. Use your turn signals, and use them at the right time. Never switch lanes when in the middle of an intersection. NEVER try to "beat the light.", Keep in mind that it is courteous to allow a vehicle to turn into traffic if the driver is waiting for a break. Remember: maintaining a decently comfortable distance between you and the driver ahead of you is an excellent rule of thumb. Note that residential areas are common grounds for children to run spontaneously into the streets without looking for oncoming cars. Remember that trucks often give their drivers difficulty stopping, turning, or backing up, we, as drivers, have all witnessed this. Be courteous of the senior citizens, as well. Make an effort to change lanes when safe if you see utility work, police and emergency vehicles up ahead, or see a lane starting to slow down to a crawl while the opposite lanes are open or have less traffic. Understand that the majority of drivers just aim to get to their destination, just like everyone else does. If you are signaled to stop by the police, be nice to the officer and they may let you go despite violating a traffic law. Don't use the shoulder or median to get around people not moving with traffic.
Acidic liquids, hot pans, and wet glasses can damage your travertine countertops. The best way to combat damage is to prevent it. Use hot pads, placemats, and coasters on your kitchen countertops. In your bathroom, place all of your beauty and health products on a vanity tray instead of directly on the counter., Travertine is a porous stone that absorbs liquids. When accidents happen, blot up the spill right away. Wiping up the spill will only cause the item to spread, increasing the area susceptible to a permanent stain.   Once a year, seal your countertops. This layer of protection will prevent stains from setting., Sanitize and wipe down your travertine countertops on a regular basis with hot water, gentle cleaners, and a microfiber rag.   Spray the surface with a gentle cleaner that is safe on natural stone. Wipe up the cleaner with a fresh microfiber rag. Polish the surface with a new microfiber cloth.	Protect your travertine countertops. Clean up spills immediately. Clean regularly with gentle products.
Line your seed containers with your seed growing medium. Fill the containers to within half an inch of the rim, rather than all the way to the top. Sprinkle water over the growing medium to moisten the growing medium all the way to the bottom. Don't douse it in water; it should just be slightly wet to provide a good environment for the seeds.  Some seeds need to be soaked for a few hours before planting, while others can go straight into the growing medium without soaking. Determine whether the seeds you have need any type of pre-processing before they get planted. Look on the seed packet or check online.          To soak seeds, place them in a clean container and cover them with room temperature water. Let them sit for between 3 and 24 hours. Strain them and pat them dry with a paper towel. If you soak your seeds, plan to plant them directly afterward. Don't let them dry out again first.  Scatter seeds evenly over the growing medium and use your fingers to lightly press them in. Cover the seeds with a layer of growing medium about three times the thickness of the seeds. Moisten the growing medium again once the seeds are sown.          Don't sow too many seeds together; make sure not to overcrowd them. Check the seed packet for each type of seed you are planting to get specific recommendations for spacing the seeds. Some seeds need to be planted deeper in the growing medium, and others shouldn't be covered at all. Most seeds are fine with a light covering of growing medium as described above, but you should check to make sure the seeds you have don't need special treatment.  Most seeds don't need sunlight to germinate, but some do, so you'll need to check to make sure you give your seeds the proper conditions. Placing the seeds in a room with a temperature between 60 and 80 degrees F is a safe bet, but again, some seeds need special treatment and require very cold or hot temperatures to do well.          You can use a heat mat under the seed tray to regulate the temperature and keep things on the warmer side during the germination period.Once the seedlings sprout, keep them in an area with a temperature above 70 °F (21 °C) until they're ready to be transplanted outside., Cover the trays lightly with a sheet of plastic wrap to keep the moisture in and regulate the temperature. Lift the plastic wrap each day to lightly water the seeds. Make sure they never get the chance to dry out, or they won't germinate properly.          Do not overwater the seeds. If they get waterlogged they won't grow. You can use newspaper instead of plastic wrap. Use a spray bottle to keep the newspaper moist while the seeds germinate.	Get the containers ready. Determine whether to soak the seeds. Sow the seeds. Put the seed containers in the right environment. Keep the growing medium moist.
Stir until most of the Epsom salt has dissolved into the water.  Clear glue will result in a brighter color of slime than will white glue.          Remember to choose non-toxic glue if small children will be involved.  Stir the mixture to combine and continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved.          Highlighter ink can be an alternative to craft paint. Simply pull the bottom off a highlighter and drop the ink filament into the slime mixture. Using gloves, squeeze the ink filament to get the ink out. Be aware, though, that highlighter ink may only glow under a blacklight.  Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime!	Combine the water and Epsom salt in a medium bowl. Add the liquid glue and stir to combine. Add the craft paint. Finished!
Cut the lid and flaps off of an egg carton first. Next, cut it straight down the middle so that you have two rows of egg cups. Set one of those strips aside for another project.   A 12 or 18-cup egg carton will work better than a 6-cup egg carton, otherwise you'll get a very short caterpillar. Use scissors to trim off any sharp corners from the cups so that they are nice and smooth.; , Flip the strip over so that you can see the outside of the cups. Paint it using acrylic paint, tempera paint, or poster paint. You can paint it all one color, or many different colors. You can even paint one end red, and the rest of it green to make it a "very hungry" caterpillar. Let the caterpillar dry before moving on.  Choose an end to be the head, then poke two holes in the middle for the antenna. You can do this with a pair of scissors or a pencil. Younger children may need help with this step.If you made a "very hungry" caterpillar, the red end is the head. You can paint the inside of the caterpillar if you want to.  Flip the caterpillar over so that you can see the inside. Cut a pipe cleaner in half. Poke each end through a hole.Set the other half of the pipe cleaner aside for another project.  Turn the caterpillar back over. Twist the pipe cleaner once, then spread it open to make a V. Decorate the pipe cleaners by gluing a pompom to the ends. You can also curl the ends over a pencil instead.If the antenna are too long, cut them shorter.  Glue two googly eyes onto the front end, just below the antenna. Use a marker to draw a smile below the eyes. If you don't have any googly eyes, you can draw the eyes on instead., Cut some pipe cleaners into thirds. Stick two mini pipe cleaners into each cup (except for the head). Tape the pipe cleaners in place, one on each side of every cup. Bend the pipe cleaners into an L shape, if desired.How many pipe cleaners you cut depends on how many cups make up your caterpillars body.  Let your imagination run wild! Paint spots or stripes on to it. Glue some pompoms down its back. Give it a goofy tongue, eyelashes, or a nose. Bend its antenna into a new shape. The possibilities are endless!	Cut apart an egg carton into rows. Paint the outside of the egg cup strip. Punch two holes in the first cup. Cut a pipe cleaner in half, then poke it through the holes. Twist the pipe cleaner to make the antenna. Give the caterpillar a face. Give it some pipe cleaner legs, if desired. Decorate the caterpillar further.
, If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use aluminum foil instead. Leave some space between each pinecone. This will allow the hot air to flow better between them. It will also give them room to open up., This will take about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it may take longer.Check the pinecones frequently so that they don't catch on fire. They are ready when they fully open and shiny., Use a pair of oven mitts, tongs, or even a soup ladle to do this. Be careful while moving the pinecones; they will be very fragile., Once they are cool, you can paint them, display them, or seal them further. They will have a shiny coating on them, which is just melted sap. This can act as a natural preservative.If you want to preserve them further, read on to the next section.	Preheat your oven to 200 to 250°F (94 to 122°C). Transfer the pinecones to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake the pinecones until they open up. Transfer the pinecones to a wire cooling rack. Allow the pinecones to cool.
, It's easier if you leave the crayon wrappers on. Squeeze a thick bead of glue along the length of the crayon, and press the glued part onto the side of the pen-holder.  Tie some ribbon around the pen-holder and glue it in place, add stickers, or write a person's name with a marker if giving as a gift.	Get a plain pen-holder or make one from a clean empty jar or sturdy paper cup.  , Glue crayons vertically around the base of the pen-holder. Add more decorations if you like. Leave to dry.
Select one that you treasure but don't mind repurposing into a notebook. It needs to be the right size for a notebook, although it can be cut down to size if needed. You'll also need printer paper seconds or similar repurposed paper for the inner pages of the notebook. Choose as many pieces as you'd like amount of pages within the book.  If you're using printer paper seconds cut them a little smaller than your greeting card., Space them evenly so when you tie it all together with the ribbon it will look neat and even., Save both pieces of the card., Using the paper as a pattern, punch holes corresponding to the ones you punched in the paper along the spine of the greeting card front. Do the same with the back part of the greeting card., Line up the holes as you do so., Feed the other end of the ribbon through the hole that's at the top or bottom of the stack, pulling it tight until the knot is flush with the surface of the greeting card. Continue feeding the ribbon through the holes, pulling it tight, until you have fed it through all the holes., Cut away any excess ribbon., If you have enough ribbon left over, you can use it as trim for the outer edges of the greeting card. Apply glue to the underside of the ribbon, lay it long sides together along the outer surface of the front of the greeting card. Press it with your fingers along the inner surface. Press together with your fingers, making sure the ribbon is smooth and flat as you go along.  You may have to fold it when you come to the corners of the greeting card in order to deal with the turn. If you have to fold it, apply a little of your glue to anything that sticks out, then press flat with your fingers.  Continue as long as you have ribbon and/or edges you'd like to trim. Do the same with the back of the greeting card if you have enough ribbon to finish it.  Now you have your book! Lay it aside and let the glue dry thoroughly before using it.	Choose a greeting card as the cover of the notebook. Prepare the paper. Punch one row of three holes along the long side of your paper. Cut the greeting card along the spine. Put the paper on top of the front part of the greeting card. Sandwich the paper between the front and back of the greeting card. Tie a small knot in one end of the ribbon. Tie another small knot in the ribbon, pushing it down with your fingers until it's flush with the surface of the greeting card. Add optional trim. Done.
Use your sewing machine to sew an even line 1/4 inch (6 mm) in from the raw edge of your chiffon.This line will give you a guide, making the hem easier to fold. It also eases the edge in a bit, making it tighter and easier to fold under later on. Consider increasing the thread tension by one place further than necessary for this basting line. Restore the setting to normal once this line is complete.  Turn the raw edge in toward the wrong side of the material, folding it along the basting line. Press it in place with a hot iron.   Holding the fabric somewhat taut along the basting line can help you fold the edge while pressing it in place. Move the iron up and down, rather than moving it side to side, to prevent the material from stretching or shifting as you press it. Use plenty of steam as you press the fold in place.  Use your sewing machine to sew another line around the edge of the chiffon. This one should be 1/8 inch (3 mm) in from the folded edge.   This line of stitches will act as another guide, making it easier to fold in the hem once more.  Use sharp scissors to trim back the raw edge as close to the new sewing line you just created in the previous step.   Make sure that you do not cut beneath or into the stitches as you complete this step.  Turn the material in toward the wrong side again, just enough to fold the raw edge under. Press this fold in place with an iron.   The second line of stitching you made should be folded in during this step. Your initial line of stitching will still be visible.  Slowly stitch around the hem, working along the edge of your hemline, until you reach the end of the hem.   You should have to visible lines of stitches from the back and one visible line from the front. You can either use a straight stitch or an edgestitch for this step. Do not back tack your hem in place. Leave enough thread at the beginning and end of the seam to knot it by hand., Iron the hem one last time to flatten it out as much as possible.   This step completes the process.	Sew a basting line around the raw edge. Fold and press. Sew to the inside of the folded edge. Trim back the raw edge. Fold over the hemline. Sew through the center of the rolled hem. Press the hem.
If you don't have an area that gets a full 8 hours of sunlight everyday, put them in a place where the mums will get at least 5 hours.If you have an option to choose between morning or afternoon sun, opt for morning sun.  Mums don’t do well with ‘wet feet’ so try to avoid soil that retains a lot of water.For in-ground planting, choose an area of the yard that doesn't accumulate too much water.  Placing them against walls or other structures, or placing them too close to other mum plants could hamper their growth or cause root competition. Mums should be planted 18 to 30 inches (45.7 to 76.2 cm) apart so that they have room to grow.  Moving your plants helps to prevent pest problems and reduces the risk of disease. (See the Dividing and Transplanting section for more instructions.)	Plant or place mums in full sun. Use a fertile soil that drains easily when planting your mums in containers. Plant mums in an area where they will receive plenty of air circulation. Move them to a new location every three years.
To save the most money gardening, select vegetables that you like to eat and would normally buy at the grocery store. Do not plant vegetables that you would not purchase on a regular basis.; , By selecting vegetables that can be easily canned or frozen, you stretch your garden investment and may consume produce from your garden throughout the year.   Plant cool-weather vegetables like onions, potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and winter squash that can be easily stored. Plant tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, corn, peas and beets that can be canned or frozen.  Plant vegetables that are expensive to buy in the store, or that you consume in large quantities. Consider options like tomatoes, green beans, onions, peppers, squash, potatoes, peas, lettuce, beets, spinach, carrots, broccoli, cucumbers and Swiss chard.	Plant produce that you and your family enjoy. Choose vegetables that can be preserved, stored or frozen. Grow vegetables that provide a high return on investment.
For this project, you will braid a bracelet out of waxed linen cord. As you braid, your will slide beads onto the the strands. Unravel your waxed linen cord on a flat surface. Use a ruler and scissors to measure and cut a 26 inch strand of waxed linen cord and a 19 inch strand of waxed linen cord., Fold the 26 inch strand of waxed linen in half. Fold the 19 inch strand in half and place it on top of the 26 inch strand. Pull one end of the 19 inch strand down so that it aligns with the two ends of the 26 inch strand. Tie a knot in the two strands approximately ½ inch from the top of the loops. Cut off the short end of the 19 inch strand so that there are three even strands remaining., In order for this bracelet to maintain its shape, you must create a tight, traditional 3-strand braid.   Cross the left cord over the center cord. Cross the right cord over the center cord. Cross the left cord over the center cord. Cross the right cord over the center cord. Repeat this process until the braid is approximately 1 inch long., The center section of the bracelet contains an assortment of size 8/0 Seed Beads. For this project, your will need between 50 to 70 beads. As you braid the waxed linen cord, you will add beads to the cord in the following pattern:   Thread 1 bead onto the left strand. Push the bead to the base of the braid and cross the left cord over the middle cord. String 1 bead onto the right cord and push it to the base of the braid. Cross the right thread over the middle thread. Thread 1 bead onto the left strand. Push the bead to the base of the braid and cross the left cord over the middle cord. String 1 bead onto the right cord and push it to the base of the braid. Cross the right thread over the middle thread. Repeat this process until the bracelet is approximately 1 inch shy of fitting your wrist. As you braid, keep your thumb at the base of the braid to prevent the beads from slipping., After adding the last bead, you will add another braided section. When the new section is approximately 1 inch long, wrap the bracelet around your wrist to ensure that it is the proper length. If you need to extend the length, continue braiding the cord until it reaches the appropriate length. Tie the three cords in a knot directly below the base of the braid., To secure your bracelet around your wrist, you will use a button-and-loop enclosure. Retrieve your two-hole button. Insert two strands through one of the button’s hole and one strand through the other hole. Tie the ends in a knot to secure the button in place. Trim the ends of your bracelet., Wrap the bracelet around your wrist. Slip the button through the loop on the other end.   Stack several of these bracelets on your wrist for a chic look.	Cut two strands of waxed linen cord. Fold and knot the strands. Plait a traditional 3-strand braid. Add beads to the braid. Finish braiding the bracelet and tie the ends in a knot. Add the two-hole button enclosure. Wear the finished product.

A south-facing window typically works best. Basil thrives in full sun but needs at least six hours of sunlight a day to grow properly.  If you cannot provide enough natural sunlight for your basil, use fluorescent grow lights or specially designed high-intensity lights instead. Basil plants receiving no natural light should receive 10 to 12 hours of artificial light.   Keep standard fluorescent lights a couple of inches (5 centimeters) away from the tops of your plants, and keep high output and compact fluorescent lamps 1 foot (1 yard) above the plants. High-intensity lights should be two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) above plants.  Direct an electric fan toward the plant, allowing it to rustle the leaves for at least two hours a day. Doing this prevents the air around the plant from getting too stagnant.  A good pH level is usually between 6.0 and 7.5. Maintain this pH with an organic fertilizer. Since basil is primarily used for culinary purposes, many non-organic fertilizers may pose a potential risk.  Test the dampness by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch (2.5 centimeters) deep. If the soil feels dry even at this depth, lightly water the plant.  Pinching the tops off will encourage better leaf growth and will prevent your basil from becoming "leggy."	Set the container near a sunny window. Supplement with artificial light. Simulate a natural habitat by running a fan. Check the plant's pH levels once a month. Keep the soil moist, but not soaked. Pinch off the tops of the basil once the seedlings reach six inches (15 centimeters) in height.
The control panel is the interface with all the buttons on it. Unscrew the screws holding it into place, or, on some models, unscrew the back panel behind it to access controls. Set the control panel someplace where it will be safe.As with most dryer repairs you should unplug your dryer before beginning this. Skip this method if you have an electronic interface. Start switch malfunctions generally occur when the start button is an older, mechanical model., The start switch is the button that you press to start the dryer. There should be wires on the back of it that are connected to the start switch with metal parts. Use pliers to pull on the metal connectors, rather than the wires themselves, to disconnect the wires from the start switch.Take note of which wires insert into which parts of the start switch. You will need to correctly reconnect these wires to the appropriate spots.  Insert the ohmmeter into the start switch and measure at a resistance of R X 1. The ohmmeter should record a reading of infinity. Now press down and hold on the start switch. The ohmmeter should now record a connectivity of zero.If the ohmmeter correctly records that the start switch has connectivity, then you should stop here. If it does not give correct readings, you should replace it.  You should pull the knob out from the front. Then remove the hardware of the start switch from the back. On the back, there might be a locking tab connecting the start switch to the panel. Press down on it with a screw driver and pull out to release the start switch., Place the new start switch where the old one was. Connect the wires correctly to the places where they had previously been connected on the old model. After the switch is inserted, you put the control panel back on and plug the dryer in.	Open the control panel. Remove the start switch. Use an ohmmeter to test connectivity. Remove the old start switch. Insert a new start switch.
It should be the room that receives the greatest sunlight as well as have a good strong floor. Try to locate the garden close to a water source.; , Many websites have downloadable and/or printable design templates available if you need a reference.   Clay pots are a popular choice, but can leak. If you choose to use clay as your planter option, be sure that you place plastic sheeting on the floor and observe the water leakage carefully.       Terracotta pots can have a tendency to dry out quickly, so water must be added frequently.       Glazed ceramics or redwood pots are a good choice and come in a variety of sizes.  Consult your local extension office, online sites and local residents for specifics on your area.  When choosing vegetable plants, take into consideration the amount of space you have. Using an online or printed design can especially help in this area. Consider how much space you have and what type of vegetables you wish to plant.       Tomato plants can easily be grown inside in large pots, with two or three to a pot. Remember that they grow quite tall and will probably need support such as stakes or cones.       Beans are always a good staple, but it is best to choose bush rather than pole when space is an issue. Onions can also easily be grown indoors, but you may want to consider the scent!        , The organic types are generally best.	Decide which room will house the indoor garden. Layout a design for your garden. Consider the type of planters. Decide on the type of plants to grow. Choose a potting soil with plenty of nutrients and compost.
Example: A man is pushing a 10kg box on a rough floor, with a coefficient of friction of µ = 0.6, by applying a 20N force. You will select our body to be the box.; ,   Example: Make a square to represent the box.    Example: These are (1) the weight of the object, (2) the pushing force of the man, (3) the normal force applied by the floor, and (4) the friction force due to the rough floor.  Always start with the weight because all objects have weight.   Example: (1) For the weight, draw an arrow pointing downward because the weight is the pulling force of the earth's gravity, which is always downward.    Example: (2) Draw an arrow that follows the direction of the pushing force. (3) Draw an arrow pointing upward for the normal force because it should always be perpendicular to the floor. (4) Draw an arrow that is opposite the direction of motion of the box for the friction.  However, if you wish to put the magnitude of the forces, you may continue to the following steps.  The weight of the object is equal to mass of object*acceleration due to gravity.   Example: W = m*a. W = (10kg)*(9.81m/s^2) = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow. Note: Forces are measured in Newtons or N.  The magnitude of the pushing force applied by the man is given as 20N. Write this beside its respective arrow.  The normal force is equal to the magnitude of the weight that acts perpendicularly to the floor. In this case, all of the weight is acting perpendicularly to the floor, therefore, N and W are equal in magnitude. So, N = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow.  The friction force is given by the formula: f=µ*N. Therefore, f = 0.6*(98.1N) = 58.86N. Write this beside its respective arrow.   Now that all forces are represented with their direction and magnitude, your FBD is ready for further engineering or physics analysis!	Identify the body/object you want to make an FBD of. Draw a simple representation of the body. Think of which forces are acting on the body. Draw the forces one by one using arrows pointing to the direction of the force. Draw the remaining forces. Label your forces properly and your basic FBD is done!, Add information about the weight. Add the push forces. Add the normal force. Add the friction force.
Hit Your Consonants. That means make every single letter heard.    She sells Seashells by the seashore. I thought a thought, but the thought I thought, was not the thought, I thought I thought.   Betty bought a bit of better 'butter.  Put your hand on your diaphragm, and start with "ho". Say "ho", and make it loud, and irritating. Then say, "hi", "hey", then "he". Do each about ten times or more.	Some twisters, with a lot of the same letter is the best. Do some vowel pushes.
Most bulletin boards are plain. They consist of a simple wooden frame with an even simpler cork board. Your board does not have to be so simple. You can paint it or cover it with fabric to make it even more special. This section will give you some customization ideas. You do not have to use all of the ideas in this section. Choose one or two that appeal the most to you.  Measure the height and length of the cork part. Do not include the frame in your measurement. Cut a piece of fabric according to your measurement. Cover the entire cork part with Mod Podge using a paintbrush or foam brush. Press the fabric down onto the Mod Podge and smooth out any wrinkles. Let the Mod Podge dry before you use your board.   You can also glue your fabric down using spray adhesive. Cover the frame with painter's tape first, then spray both the fabric and the cork part with glue. Press the fabric down onto the board and smooth out any wrinkles. Remove the tape.You can also use wrapping paper for this. Keep in mind that any holes you make in the paper using pushpins or thumbtacks, they will stay.  Cover the frame part with painter's tape. Next, paint the entire cork part using acrylic paint or spray paint. Remove the tape, then wait for the paint to dry. Depending on the brand you used, this may take anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours. You may need several coats of paint to get the texture and color you want. Wait each coat to dry before applying a new one.   Use a foam brush or paintbrush to apply the acrylic paint. If your board is very large, use a foam paint roller instead.You can also use chalkboard paint. Paint your board with a paint primer first, then apply two to three coats of chalkboard paint.Once the paint dries, cover the entire board with chalk, then wipe the chalk off. This is known as "priming."  , Place a stencil down where you'd like your design. Use a foam brush or a stencil brush to tap some acrylic paint over the stencil. Carefully remove the stencil before the paint dries. Allow the paint to dry (at least 20 minutes for most brands) before you put anything on it.If the stencil moves too much, tape down the edges with painter's tape. Consider painting the cork part a solid color first. Wait for the paint to dry, then stencil designs over it using a contrasting color., Cut four pieces of ribbon: two for the height, and two for the length. Glue the ribbon down onto the cork part, just inside the frame, using fabric glue. Allow the glue to dry before you use the board.You can also use washi tape or any other patterned scrapbooking tape. You can buy them in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Make sure the width of the tape will match the border of your pin board.  Place painter's tape on the inside edges of the bulletin board, so that the frame is still showing but the cork part is partly covered. Paint the frame using acrylic paint and a paintbrush or foam brush. Remove the tape before the paint dries. Let the paint dry before you use the board. This can take anywhere between 20 minutes to two hours, depending on the brand you used.  Sometimes, even painted frames look a little bland. You can fix this by adding some texture. Here are some ideas on what you can do to make the frame part look more interesting:   Cut a strip from each tape, making sure each one matches the length of one side of your pin board. Place washi tape or any other patterned tape over the frame. Glue ribbon over the frame using fabric glue. Tape the sides first and then the top and bottom. Get a ruler and smooth over the tape. On the inner edge of the board and tape, use the edge of the ruler to push the edges of the tape down evenly. Use hot glue, super glue, or tacky glue to attach rhinestones or buttons to the frame. Cover the frame with some Mod Podge, then shake glitter onto it. Cover the frame again using glossy Mod Podge to seal the glitter in.  Buy a large sheet of cork from an arts and crafts store. Next, buy a frame that fits the cork. Take the glass and backing out of the frame. Draw a line of glue inside the frame, then press the corkboard down into it.	Consider customizing your board. Give your board a fresh look by covering the cork part with fabric. Make your board more colorful by painting the cork part. Stencil your board. Add a border around the cork part, just inside the frame. Paint the frame. Decorate the frame. Make your own bulletin board using a corkboard and a fancy frame.
Office buildings, hotels, restaurants, and other commercial spaces often have pre-established evacuations plans and procedures. Check with building management to find out about the evacuation protocol if you are in this type of building.Look for evacuation maps on building doors and in public areas such as lobbies and stairwells. If you are looking for evacuation plans for your office, check with your manager or the company head regarding current evacuation plans and what roles different people are to fill during an emergency.; , Find routes that will get people out of the building with the least risk during an evacuation. Look at your building plans to help people find the exits nearest to them, and create an evacuation plan that takes people to their nearest exit quickly and safely.Try to avoid potential hazards such as going through kitchens or areas with large windows. These pose excess risk as lines in kitchens can break and exacerbate emergencies while windows may blow out and cause increased risk due to glass. Be sure to avoid mechanical transportation such as elevators, as these could fail and put people at an increased risk. Use stairwells whenever possible.  Provide clear markers for people to guide people to exits from the building. Post evacuation maps throughout the building, and mark exits with clear “EXIT” signs.In spaces that do not get much natural light, such as interior hallways, you may also want to consider placing photoluminescent strips along the sides of the floors to help guide people to the nearest exit.  Make sure other people using the building know about the evacuation plan. Help them identify their nearest exit and tell them about safety precautions such as avoiding elevators.It may also be helpful to appoint safety monitors to help guide others in the event of an evacuation if you are dealing with a large space that holds a great number of people.  If possible, find out why you are evacuating before you leave the building. Knowing why an evacuation has been called can help you modify your plan if necessary to best accommodate the circumstances.If, for example, there is a fire that blocks your nearest exit, you know to go in the opposite direction of the fire, even if another exit is further away. If there is an active threat such as a bomb threat or an armed person spotted, seek instructions from authorities such as the police or fire department before attempting to evacuate.  Once you know you are to evacuate, proceed quickly to your nearest exit. Do try to avoid panicking, as panic can quickly disorganized a group, slow down the evacuation process, and put more people in danger.Do not worry about gathering belongings that are not immediately within reach. Taking time to pack a bag or go to another room once an evacuation has been called is dangerous. Take only what is already on your person or already packed and within arm’s reach. If possible, exit through your nearest clearly marked exit sign. If a standard exit truly is not accessible, look for other ways out of the building such as through a window.  Once you have exited the space, make sure to put safe distance between you and the building. Depending upon the situation, authorities may have set up a do not cross line to indicate a safe distance.Consider whether there is a designated meeting place outlined in your evacuation plan. If you are supposed to meet with others in a designated area, proceed directly to that area. Think about how much space is necessary for different types of emergencies. An emergency such as an electrical problem in the building likely requires less space than something like a fire. Consider how much space you need based on the reason for evacuation.  Once you are a safe distance away from the building, check in with the authorities or emergency responders to let them know you're safe and see what your next steps need to be. This is also the time to let someone know if you have been injured during evacuation.If no authorities or first responders are present, call the police or fire department as appropriate to warn them of potential threats and receive further instruction.  Before you reenter the building, make sure you get clearance from emergency responders that the building is safe and whatever threat caused the evacuation has been contained. Do not reenter a building that has not been inspected by the proper authorities.If you were sent away after an evacuation, call to check in with building manager or local authorities to make sure the space is safe to re-enter. Let them know, "We had to evacuate because of an emergency, and we would like to know if it is safe to reenter the space?" Additionally, it may be helpful to ask, "Are there any precautions we should take when going back into the space for the first time?"  , If physical damage was done to the space, take careful note of what damage occurred and what may be harmed or missing. Report any damage to the building manager, or to the authorities and your insurance if you own the building.In addition to noting damaged items, note anything that seems lost or stolen. Take photographs or video of the damage as well as thorough notes in case it is necessary for you to file an insurance claim.  Take this evacuation experience as an opportunity to work out kinks in your plan. Check with others if possible to see if there were obstacles or moments when the evacuation was slowed or stalled, and update your plan accordingly.   If an evacuation was particularly slow, look for alternative routes or consider dividing people up more evenly among exits. Recap with the evacuated group to address any problems that you saw and suggest improvements for the future.	Check evacuation plans. Identify safe escape routes. Mark your routes. Inform others. Assess the situation. Proceed quickly to an exit. Get some distance. Check in with responders. Get clearance. Assess any damage. Update evacuation plans.
Interrupting can put the breaks on effective conversation. Always allow a few seconds of silence after someone finishes talking before offering your response. This allows you to make sure the speaker is done talking.Do not talk over someone either. No matter how passionately you feel about a subject, do not start talking until the other person has finished.  Unless you are explicitly asked, do not offer advice. Unsolicited advice can make it seem like you're not really listening. You're only hearing what you want, and offering advice in response. If someone just wants to talk, refrain from trying to tell them what to do., Never change the subject before the speaker has gotten their words out. Even if a subject makes you uncomfortable, it's important you let the speaker express themselves.If there's family drama, you may be tempted to hurry the speaker. For example, if they talk about how you talked to your father last week, you may start talking about something you saw on TV that night. Avoid doing this. Part of communicating with your family is talking about difficult subjects at times. You need to allow conversations to flow where they will, even if a topic upsets you.  Never rush the person talking. Do not interject with your interpretation before the speaker is finished just to hurry the speaker along. Never say things like, "Can you get to the point?" This will make it seem like you're not invested in the conversation., Even if you're frustrated or angry with someone, try to cultivate empathy when listening. Try to understand how the person feels and why. It's never a good idea to listen with judgment, as this will reduce your ability to fully communicate. Even if you disagree with someone's actions or opinions, avoid judgment.	Do not interrupt. Refrain from offering advice. Do not change the subject prematurely. Avoid hurrying the speaker. Refrain from judgment.
Losing money can be very upsetting, but getting frazzled will make it more difficult for you to think about where you had the money last. Wait a moment before you begin your search and take a deep breath., You may know the exact amount of money that you are missing, but if not, make an estimate. Are you missing a small amount or a larger amount? What denomination was the money? $1s, $5s, $20s, etc.? Having a solid idea of how much you have lost and what bill denominations will make it easier for you to ask people about your missing money.  Try to remember where you had the money last. Did you have it at home, take it with you to the grocery store, or somewhere else? Do you remember spending any of it? If so, did you put the change back into your wallet or your pocket? Do the best you can to remember the details of when and where you last had the money.  Now that you have thought about how much money you have lost, as well as where and when you might have lost it, you can plan out where you should look. Include the places you might have lost your money and anywhere you passed through along the way.  Check usual and unusual places for your missing money. Look in the pockets of the clothes you wore when you last had the money. Check between couch cushions and on the floor. Check where you stash your keys at the end of the day.  Go back to the places where you might have lost your money and follow the same route that you took before. As you walk, scan the ground for your money just in case it fell out of your pocket along the way.  Check the floor and around the seats in your car to see if your money is there. It may have fallen out of your pocket as you got into or out of your car. Check the glove compartment, overhead visors, and other places that you might have stowed your money without remembering.  If you think you might have lost your money in a store or some other place of business, ask the manager if anyone found your money. Say how much you lost and what denomination the money was in. You can also leave your name and number just in case someone turns the money in.  If the places you went to with the money have a lost and found, check to see if your money is there. You may have to offer identifying information about your money, such as the amount, bill denomination, and when you lost it, so be prepared., A small amount of money probably would not be turned into the police, but a large amount might be. If you have lost a substantial amount of money, then you may want to report it to the police. Conduct a thorough search first, but if you still can’t find your money, file a report with the police.	Take a deep breath. Estimate how much money you have lost. Think about where you last had the money. Make a plan. Search your home. Retrace your steps. Search your car. Ask if anyone found your money. Check the lost and found. Consider reporting your lost money to the police.
If you are working from a design, then make sure that you check the design for embroidery floss recommendations.This can take the guesswork out of choosing and embroidery floss brand, color, and type.   Bring the design guide along with you to the craft store as a reference or make a list of the items you will need before you go.; , Your project may only require one color or you may need several colors. Embroidery floss comes in a wide range of colors, so you will have many options to choose from.To make it easier to choose when you arrive at the craft store, make a list of the colors you will need before you go.  Adding texture to your projects is optional, but it can be a nice touch. Think about your embroidery project to decide if using a special thread might help to give your project the desired texture.For example, if you will be hand embroidering a landscape, then using wool thread for the grass could provide texture.  Using a well-known brand name will help to ensure that you are getting a quality thread, and it will also help to reduce the chance that you are buying old thread that has been on the rack for a long time. Some brand name threads to look for include:Coats & Clark Madeira DMC Anchor Cosmo Presencia Janome  , It may be tempting to pick up thread sold in bins at dollar stores or on clearance racks, but you should avoid buying these types of thread. If the thread is cheap or old, then it will be more likely to shred or break while you are using it.Purchase thread that looks like it is in good condition and avoid any old looking thread.	Check the design for recommendations. Identify the colors you will need. Note any special texture needs. Consider the brand. Avoid using sewing thread, bargain thread, or old thread.
Knobs are smaller, and can be installed at only one point where the knob meets the cabinet. Pulls are handles, and are often attached at 2 different points where the pull meets the cabinet.; , You will want the cabinet knobs to complement the style of the room you are updating. Browse the different colors, finishes and styles that are available in cabinet knobs.   Choose modern knobs if you prefer a contemporary look. Look for metallics in glossy finishes, bold shapes, interesting sizes or retro satin metals. Select traditional knobs if you prefer an antique or classic style. You can find knobs that are mushroom shaped, wooden, wrought iron or pewter to achieve a colonial or country look. Buy novelty or specialty knobs to make your cabinets fun. They can come in many themes and styles, including nautical shapes, jeweled knobs, fruits, birds and other animals.  You will be pulling these knobs every time you need to get into a cabinet, so make sure they are easy to grab and pull.   Ask to try a knob if you are shopping in a store, and if you are considering ordering knobs online, request a sample. Check to see if the knobs will catch on clothing or jewelry. Round knobs are less likely to grab your clothing, but knobs with sharp ends or points might snag on fibers.  Hold one knob up to your cabinet before you purchase a whole set of knobs for all your cabinets. Make sure it is not disproportionate to the cabinet.  Getting a sample knob will help you decide if you like it before you buy. You may have to pay for the sample knob, but most retailers will allow you to return it or put cost of the knob towards the full price of your purchase.  Retailers such as Lowe's, Home Depot, Target and Walmart will have selections of cabinet knobs. Shopping in stores will allow you to touch and feel the knob, and match it to any fabric or color swatches you may bring with you.  Access thousands of online retailers by doing an Internet search for cabinet knobs. You should also check major sites such as Amazon, eBay and Overstock. You will probably find a larger selection than you will in stores, and better prices. Be prepared to pay for shipping, however.  Find out if you are able to return or exchange the knobs if you change your mind.  You can find previously owned knobs at antique stores, flea markets, yard sales, or online at sites such as eBay, Amazon and Craigslist. If you have a Habitat for Humanity ReStore outlet near you, you can buy donated items from there at a fraction of retail price.	Distinguish between knobs and pulls. Decide on color and style. Test the knobs to make sure they feel comfortable in your hand. Match the size of the knobs to the size of your cabinets. Ask for samples. Shop for cabinet knobs at hardware stores or department stores. Shop for cabinet knobs online. Ask about return policies. Look for used cabinet knobs to save money.
Kohlrabi is a brassica, in the cabbage family. Increasingly popular, kohlrabi is also available in different varieties, all easy to grow, with slight variations in look and time to maturity. The biggest difference is whether or not you pick a green or purple variety.   Green kohlrabi varieties include the Korridor and the Winner, which mature quickly, in about 50 days, compared to about 60 for some other varieties. Bright lime-green in color, they make an attractive addition to a garden bed. Purple kohlrabi varieties like the Azur Star and Kolibri are particularly bug-resistent, because of the purple leaves on the plant, which keep the insects away. Taste-wise, you won't notice much difference. Storage varieties like Kossak, Superschmelz, and Gigante are, as you might guess, much larger than the regular varieties of kohlrabi. They'll last longer in the cellar or the fridge, prepared correctly. Taste-wise, these varieties are all very similar.; , Kohlrabi should be planted in full sun, close to other roots, like potatoes, beets, onions. Kohlrabi are big drinkers and feeders, which means they'll need a good amount of water and fertile soil. It's usually recommended that you plant five or six cabbage-family plants for each member of the household. Sow three times the amount.   Kohlrabi should be kept in a separate part of the garden from pole beans, tomatoes, and strawberries.  Several weeks before the last frost of spring, Kohlrabi may be planted, which means you can start tilling your soil early. Kohlrabi should be planted in well-tilled soil enriched with compost. It's hardy in most conditions, though it excels in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8.Good drainage is also helpful in avoiding rot and blight in your kohlrabi plants, so make sure you've got an area of the garden that doesn't collect water too much.  Kohlrabi is a hardy grower that should be planted about a month before the last frost in spring. Ideally, you want the plant to mature before the temperature gets much over 75 F, which means you’ll want to plant it early, among your earliest sows, probably, in an area with a very hot summer. Kohlrabi will mature in 50-60 days.   If you live in a place with warm winters, it’s also common to plant kohlrabi in late autumn to harvest in early winter. The plant should be able to withstand autumn frosts. If winter's running long, you can start kohlrabi in pots indoors and move the plants outside about a month before the last frost, then plant them after.  Kohlrabi seeds should be sowed in moist soil about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep and an inch apart, a single seed in each hole. Use your finger to make a small indent in the ground, then cover the seeds loosely with soil. Leave at least an inch between each plant, which you'll thin out later.   Kohlrabi should be planted in rows, which should be spaced about a foot apart to give them room to spread out and mature.  When you see your starts coming up, weed around them very carefully, paying special attention to milkweed, thistle, and any other local weeds. Kohlrabi are easily beaten out in the beginning, and have a shallow root structure, since the bulb is above ground. The most critical time for kohlrabi is in the first couple of weeks. Let them flourish, then thin them out.  After a couple of weeks, the plants should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall and you can start thinning out the most successful of them to give them room to grow. Carefully dig up the plants and re-space them, so they're about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart, moving some to other places in the garden if necessary.   The greens of young kohlrabi can be eaten raw, in salads, or can be thrown into stir-frys as any field green. It's a unique and nutrient-rich way of spicing up a meal.  After thinning out your kohlrabi, it's important to provide them a bit of structure and nitrogen support, so you should pack some compost around the base of kohlrabi to help hold them up and inject some nutrients into the soil. This can be the big difference between healthy-looking big bulbs and woody in edibles.  Kohlrabi need lots of water, and do well in relatively mild or Mediterranean climates. If the soil is dry, under-watered kohlrabi will become woody and unpleasant to eat. If the split striations on the bulb start to look dry, increase your waterings.   When watering, water the soil around the base of each bulb, don't water on top of the plants, which can increase the possibility of rot. This goes for most cabbage.  Kohlrabi and other cabbages are susceptible to cutworms, making it important that you stay on top of these pests as your plants mature. You'll notice holes in the leaves and egg clusters on the underside of the leaves. If you find this, move swiftly.   Wash leaves with egg clusters on them thoroughly, removing the eggs as you find them. It’s common to “collar” the leaf stems of the kohlrabi by tying them up to get the leaves off the ground. This can help to keep the infestation at bay. Bacillus thuringiensis, if you’ve got a serious problem.Keep an eye out for rot, as well. “Cabbage yellows” is easy to recognize, due to the yellowish-brownish color the leaves will take on. Remove infected plants entirely.  Kohlrabi is ready to be harvested when the stem is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in diameter, and the bulbs are big and healthy-looking. The bulbs of different varieties will grow to different sizes, so you'll partially be using your judgment. If you let them go too long, kohlrabi will become slightly woody and unpleasant.  Kohlrabi have a crisp texture and a mild flavor that makes them a versatile and nutrient-rich food for your table. It's like a cross between a cabbage and an apple, sweet and savory at the same time. Roast it up with other root vegetables, bake and mash kohlrabi, or serve it in a mixed vegetable sauté.   Kohlrabi is eaten in Germany as a bar snack, dressed with salt, cut into slices, and served raw. It's maybe the best possible way to eat this crunchy vegetable, served with a mug of beer.	Select a variety of kohlrabi. Select a planting location for kohlrabi. Prepare the soil for sowing. Plant kohlrabi in cool weather. Plant seeds in an even row. Weed carefully and regularly. Thin successful seedlings about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart. Mulch plants with compost. Water deeply and frequently. Watch closely for cutworms. Harvest kohlrabi by pulling up the entire plant. Enjoy kohlrabi raw or cooked.
Most boats stored outdoors for the winter are either shrink-wrapped or have a tarp covering the top of it protecting it from the outside elements (snow, sleet, ice). Depending on the size of the boat, often people will create a framework in order to support a tarp or when shrink wrapping a boat.  Uncover the boats tarp or shrink-wrap carefully, avoiding rips or tears. If needed, take pictures and label parts of the framework so it can be reassembled and reused the next year. Disassemble the framework and store materials.       ; , Performing a general inspection of the exterior of the boat can be very helpful when determining what things need to be done. If the boat had been covered properly for the winter, a general cleaning, waxing, and painting should be the only necessary procedures needed to make the boat look good again.  Check the condition of the fiberglass for light dirt, dark stains/streaks to determine the type of cleaner needed. Inspect the exterior wood to determine if it needs to be refinished. Check the bottom of the boat to see if it had been painted with an anti-fouling paint (this procedure is necessary if the boat stays in the water during the summer season).  Make a list of supplies you think you need based on the assessments made and head to your local marine store. If you are unsure of the right supplies you need, the employees at the store can help you choose the right products to complete each task.  Take inventory of what supplies you already own. Compose a list of supplies you do not possess and what you may need more of.  Boats can be made of different materials (fiberglass, plastic, wood). For each type there are different ways to protect it and keep it looking new. The most common material used to build boats is fiberglass. If the boat is made of fiberglass, it is necessary to reapply wax yearly to keep it protected from the elements of the water and the sun.  Wash the exterior of the boat from top down with a mild boat soap and water (for the stubborn spots, there are stronger spot cleaners you can use). Let the boat sit and wait until it is completely dry before moving on. Apply the protective coat of wax, either by hand with a rag or using an electric buffing tool (wax can be in a paste or liquid form, choose what is best for you).  Many boats are made with the bottom half of the exterior covered in paint. This acts as another form of protection against external elements. When preparing your boat, another way to protect the outer layer of the boat is to reapply a fresh coat of paint to prevent things such as algae growth if the paint is either chipping away or fading. If the bottom of the boat needs painting first get the boat ready to paint.  Use blue masking tape to tape off the top edge of the paint line. Scrape off any loose paint and lightly sand the bottom. Rinse off the bottom and let it sit to dry completely before moving on. Paint the bottom using the proper paint, brush, roller and clothing for the job.  Many boats have accent wood pieces (such as teak wood) located around both the inside and outside of the boat. A lot of times with the sun beating down on them, those pieces can start to fade, looking dull and slightly grey. They can be restored by sanding and staining them. You can usually mask off surrounding fiberglass and restore small accent pieces without trying to remove them; however, some larger sections may need to be removed and restored outside of the boat.  Unscrew and remove any large pieces of accent wood. Use masking tape to tape off surrounding fiberglass (if you plan on leaving smaller accent pieces in place). Sand all pieces of wood (large and small) either by hand with sandpaper, or with a small electric palm sander. Clean away dust particles with a small vacuum and wipe with a dry cloth. Apply the new finish of your choice based on the manufactures specifications. Remove masking tape and reinstall the pieces that were removed.  Now that the exterior of the boat is prepared and ready for the upcoming season, the next step is to perform a visual inspection on the boats engine(s) and mechanical systems. If your boat has an internal engine(s) it is typical that these engines were filled with some type of antifreeze to protect them from winter temperatures.  Perform a visual inspection of the engines, looking for any leaks (if leaks are present this could be a result of improper winterization). Contact a mechanic to determine what repairs are needed (if leaking occurs); or if there are no present leaks, proceed on to next inspection. Open and close the water supply valve(s) located down in the hull (typically at its lowest point) to make sure the valve(s) operate properly. Leave the valve(s) in the open position (if they operate smoothly). Inspect all cooling system hosing for cracks. Check engine fluids for proper levels.  Many modern boats have more than one battery that are typically located deep in the hull. Depending on the type of charging system you have the batteries can either be left on the boat or they may have to be removed, which can be difficult because they are so heavy. Most larger boats have an onboard charging system, that when plugged into a power source, can maintain a fully charged battery, thus preventing it/them from freezing or breaking. If the batteries have to be removed it is important to store them somewhere inside to keep them warm.  Check to confirm the charger is still in operation and inspect the batteries for any cracks or leaks (If the batteries are left on board). Re-install all of the batteries, making sure all of the connections are tight (If the batteries were removed and charged elsewhere).  If your boat is equipped with an outdrive, trim-tabs, or both, your boat has at least one hydraulic system. These systems are typically very reliable year after year, but occasionally an O-ring or rubber seal could fail, causing hydraulic fluid to leak. It is better to know if something is malfunctioning on the outside of the boat before it goes in the water!  Operate either the boats outdrive or trim-tabs with someone standing outside at the back of the boat to make sure they are operating properly.  A boat typically has a ½ inch screwed plug that screws into the hull from the outside. This plug is usually left out when out of the water (during the winter) to allow any accumulating water to run out.  Re-install the drain plug. Tighten securely with a wrench.  Most of the time larger boats have some type of fresh water system (a sink, ice maker, or toilet). These systems would have had to be winterized to prevent freezing. The process of winterizing can be different for every boat based on how complex the boats water system is. Sometimes the water lines or sections are disconnected to allow water to drain out.  If any hose or fittings had been disconnected during the winterization process, reconnect these sections. Tighten securely with the proper tool.  Built-in electronics are becoming more and more common in newer boat models (radars, GPS, etc.) However, older boat models normally had separate devices mounted on or around the driver’s helm station. Typically, these devices were removed from the boat during the winter months to prevent possible damage or potential theft.  Re-install these devices (if removed).  All boats are required to carry certain distress signals including, flairs, fire extinguishers, life jackets, an anchor and anchor lines for the safety of everyone on board. For each distress signal there are different requirements so it is important to make sure all safety equipment is up to code and then you should be good to go!  Check flairs for expiration dates (if expired, purchase new ones). Check the fire extinguisher (purchase a new one if it is discharged). Provide life jackets for everyone on board.	Uncover the boat. Assess the exterior. Compose a list. Clean the boat. Paint. Sand and stain. Check the engine. Check the battery. Check everything is operating smoothly. Don’t forget the drain plug!, Check the fresh water systems. Reinstall electronics if needed. Take safety precautions.
While “synthesizer” is used synonymously with “electronic musical instrument,” the synthesizer is the part of the electronic instrument that produces the actual music: the beats, the rhythms, and the tones.   Early synthesizers, such as the Moog Minimoog, were capable of producing only one tone at a time (monophonic). These synthesizers could not produce the secondary tones that other musical instruments could, although some synthesizers could produce two pitches at once if two keys were pressed. From the mid-1970s on, synthesizers that can produce multiple tones at once (polyphonic) have been available, allowing you to produce chords as well as individual notes.Most early synthesizers were separate from the means used to control the sounds they made. Many electronic musical instruments, particularly those for casual home use, now feature the synthesizer physically integrated with its control unit.; , The earliest synthesizers were controlled by flipping switches, turning knobs, or in the case of the Theremin (what the Etherophone was renamed), by where the operator’s hands were positioned over the instrument. Modern controllers come in more musician-friendly varieties and control the synthesizer through the Musical Instrumental Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. Some of the controllers are described below:   Keyboard. This is the most common synthesizer controller. Keyboards range in size from the full 88-key (7-octave) keyboard found on digital pianos to as few as 25 keys (2 octaves) on a toy-sized keyboard. Keyboards for home use typically have 49, 61, or 76 keys (4, 5, or 6 octaves). Some keyboards feature weighted keys to simulate the responsiveness of a piano, while others feature spring-loaded keys, and still others combine springs with lighter weights than fully weighted keys.. Many feature touch sensitivity, where the hardness of the keys (how hard they are struck) determines how loud the sound generated is. Mouthpiece/wind controller. This controller is found on a wind synthesizer, an electronic instrument designed similar to a soprano saxophone, clarinet, recorder, or trumpet. You blow into it to regulate the sound, which can be modified by using your thumb or jaw in certain ways.MIDI guitar. This is software that lets you use your acoustic or electric guitar, with a pickup, to control a synthesizer.MIDI guitars work by attempting to convert string vibrations into digital data. There is often a delay between the input and output because of the amount of sampling necessary to create the digitized sound.SynthAxe: No longer made, the SynthAxe worked by dividing the fretboard into 6 diagonal zones and used the strings as sensors. How much bending the strings were subjected to determined the tone generated.Keytar: This controller is shaped like the body and neck of a guitar, but has a 3-octave keyboard on the guitar body and other sound-manipulating controls on the neck. Inspired by an 18th-century instrument called the orphica, it offers players the control of a keyboard and the mobility of a guitar.Electronic drum pads: Introduced in 1971, electronic drum pads are usually available in kits similar to that of acoustic drums, including cymbals. Early versions played pre-recorded samples, while later versions create the sounds mathematically. Used with headphones, it is possible to play an electronic drum kit so that only the player hears the sound it makes.Radio drum. Originally intended for use as a three-dimensional “mouse,” the radio drum senses the position of its two sticks in three dimensions, varying the sound produced according to where on the “drum” surface it is touching.BodySynth. This was a wearable controller that used muscle tension and body movement to control sound and lighting. It was intended for use by dancers and performance artists, but in many cases was too difficult to control. Simpler forms of the BodySynth have used gloves or shoes to serve as control units., While standalone electronic musical instruments are enough to play electronic music, you will need a computer system if you want to produce electronic music.   A desktop or laptop works well for creating music. If you plan on producing music at a fixed location, you’ll probably want a desktop. If you want to produce music at different locations, such as wherever your band rehearses, you’ll probably want a laptop. Use the operating system you’re most comfortable with. However, you should use the most recent version of Windows or MacOS that you can get access to. Your system should have a powerful enough CPU and enough memory to easily handle creating music with it. If you don’t know what to look for, a custom-built system designed for audio or video game usage should give you an idea of what kind of specifications to look for., You can make perfectly good electronic music with the sound chip that came with your computer and inexpensive speakers. However, if you can afford it, you should consider one or more of the following upgrades:   Sound card. Using a sound card designed for making electronic music is recommended if you plan to do a lot of external recording.Studio monitors. These are not computer monitors, but rather loudspeakers designed for studio recording. (“Monitor” in this sense means that the speaker accurately reproduces the source audio with no or minimal distortion.) Lower-cost quality studio monitors include those made by M-Audio and KRK Systems, while higher-end monitors include those made by Focal, Genelec, and Mackie.Studio-grade headphones. Listening through headphones instead of speakers lets you concentrate on individual parts of your song better, helping you track rhythms and sound levels. Studio headphone manufacturers include Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser., You’ll need the following software applications for making electronic music:   Digital audio workstation (DAW). The DAW is the actual music-making software that enables all your other software components work together to make music. Their interface usually simulates the mixer, track, and transport controls of analog music studios, as well as a waveform display of the recorded sound.Various DAWs include Ableton Live, Cakewalk Sonar, Cubase, FL Studio, Logic Pro (operates in MacOS only), Pro Tools, Reaper, and Reason. There are also freeware DAWs such as Ardour and Zynewave Podium.Audio editor program. An audio editor program provides greater musical editing capability than that found in DAW software, including the ability to edit samples and to convert your composition to MP3 format. Sound Forge Audio Studio is an example of an inexpensive audio editor, while Audacity is one of many freeware versions available. Virtual Studio Technology (VST) synthesizers/instruments. These are software versions of the synthesizer components of the electronic musical instruments described in the previous section. You install them as plugins into your DAW. Many of these plugins can be found online for free by doing a search for “free soft synths” (free software synthesizers) or “free vsti,” or you can purchase VST synthesizers from providers such as Artvera, H.G. Fortune, IK Multimedia, Native Instruments, or reFX. VST effects. These plugins provide musical effects such as reverberation, choral sound, delay, and others. They are available from many of the same providers as VST synthesizer plugins, in either paid or freeware versions. Samples. Samples are snatches of musical sounds, beats, and rhythms you can use to enhance your compositions. They are usually organized in packs specific to a given musical genre (such as blues, jazz, country, rap, or rock) and include both individual sounds and sound loops. Commercial sample packs usually offer their samples royalty-free; you buy the license to use them in your own compositions when you buy the sample pack. Some audio software companies include access to free samples online, and there are third-party sources of both free samples and samples you have to pay for., Although you can compose music on your computer with its keyboard as a “virtual piano keyboard” and your mouse, you’ll likely find it more natural to connect a MIDI controller to your system. As with standalone electronic musical instruments, a keyboard is the most commonly used MIDI controller, but you can use any of the other types of controllers described under “Electronic Musical Instrument Components” that your software supports.  While you can play an electronic musical instrument or compose music on computer without being able to read music, some knowledge of musical structure will help you understand how to make better arrangements and spot mistakes in the composition you’re working on.   Some of the music theory that can help you is covered in the wikiHow article “How to Make Music.”  , Even if you’ve tried it before you bought it, spend some time experimenting with your equipment before you take on a serious project. You’ll have a better idea of what it can do and perhaps come up with a few ideas for projects to do with it.  Each musical genre has certain elements it is associated with. The easiest way to learn those elements is to listen to a number of songs in each genre you’re interested in to see how they make use of these elements:   Beats and rhythms. Rap and hip-hop are noted for heavy, driving beats and rhythms, while big band jazz is noted for bouncy, syncopated rhythms and country music often features a shuffle beat. Instrumentation. Jazz is noted for its use of brass (trumpet, trombone) and woodwind instruments (clarinet, saxophone), while heavy metal is noted for loud electric guitars, Hawaiian music for steel guitars, folk music for acoustic guitars, mariachi for trumpets and guitars, and polka for tuba and accordion. However, many songs and artists in one genre have successfully incorporated instrument sounds from another genre, such as Bob Dylan’s adopting the electric guitar for folk music at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival,the use of mariachi trumpets to open Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire,”or Ian Anderson’s flute-playing as lead musician for the rock group Jethro Tull.Song structure: Many songs with vocals played on the radio begin with an introduction, followed by a verse, then a chorus, another verse, repeat the chorus, a bridge (often an abbreviated verse), the chorus, and a closing (called an “outro”). In contrast, most of the instrumental “trance” music played in dance clubs begins with an introduction, followed by a melody hook that builds to a point where all the elements of the song are played together, concluding with a fading outro., The beats and rhythms are the backbone that the rest your song hangs on. Here is where you use the drum sounds from your sample packs.  The next thing to add is the bass rhythm, whether from a bass guitar or other low-pitched instrumental sound. Be sure that your bass rhythm and drum beat work together before bringing in other instrumental sounds., Not all songs have a single rhythm. Some use multiple rhythms, with the additional rhythms coming into the song at places designed to catch the listener’s attention or at key moments in the song’s story. Be sure the additional rhythms work with the main rhythm to produce the effect you’re looking for.  This is where your VST instruments come into play. You can use their preset sounds or experiment with their controls to find the sound you want., You want the sounds produced by the instruments that play the beat, rhythms, and melody to work together. To achieve this, pick one component to serve as the reference sound to adjust the other components against; in most cases, this will be the beat sound.In some cases, you’ll be looking for a “fatter” (richer) sound instead of a louder sound. To do this, you can use multiple instruments on a given part or use the same instrument multiple times. The latter is often done with vocal recordings, either of background singers or sometimes the lead singer.This is how singer Enya achieves her sound on her records. You may want to introduce some variety by using different instruments on different choruses of the song, particularly if you’re trying to evoke different emotional responses from your listeners at different places. You may also want to vary the register, the pitch at which the song is being played, to keep the song lively. You don’t have to fill every second of your composition with every trick at your disposal. Sometimes, such as on the verses, you can leave out the chordal harmonies and let the beat, melody, and vocals carry your song. At other times, such as at the beginning and end, you may want to use only vocals., If you’re making electronic music for someone other than yourself, you have to take your audience’s expectations into account, such as in creating an intro that will grab them and make them listen to the rest of the song. You don’t have to cater to their every whim, however; if making a big production of the chorus doesn’t seem right to you, don’t do it.	Make electronic music with a synthesizer. Manipulate the synthesizer with the instrument controller. Choose a computer system with enough power, and make sure you’re familiar with the system. Pair your computer with good sound equipment. Install good music-making software. Consider a MIDI controller. Learn some music theory. Learn the capabilities of your instrument or software. Familiarize yourself with the musical genre(s) you want to compose in. Lay down the beats first. Add the bass rhythm. Add additional rhythms, if desired. Layer in the melody and harmony. Mix the sounds to the levels you want. Know what your audience expects.
Reinvigorate the soil by sprinkling a slow-acting fertilizer around the snowball tree a month after you’ve put it in the ground. Slow-acting fertilizer delivers nutrients over a long period of time to keep your plant healthy., Cut off dead blooms or branches during blooming season, which takes place from March to July. Trimming dead growths from the plant will make the branches grow back healthier and bushier.   Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to cut off the damaged section., Suckers are offshoots of the snowball tree that look like thick branches growing on ground level. Because suckers are offshoots of the tree, they cause the tree to divide its nutrients and resources between the main part of the tree and the suckers. Use pruning shears to cut the sucker cleanly close to where its base meets the tree.Removing suckers allows the tree to retain all of its nutrients, making it much healthier.  Check on your plant every week or so. If your area is experiencing a drought or has had very little rain, water your snowball tree. This is especially important when your tree is young and delicate.   Be sure to water at the base of the plant instead of over the top of the plant. Watering at the base ensures that the roots absorb the water.	Use slow-acting fertilizer about four weeks after planting. Remove dead or damaged branches. Remove suckers close to the base of the tree. Water when the soil is dry.
Optionally, you can aerate your lawn first to provide nutrients deeper into the soil.Mulch the leaves into small pieces with your mower, about dime-sized. You may have to mow over them a few times if the leaves are large or the layer is deep.When you cleanup a yard like this, you will leave the small pieces on the lawn to work their way into the soil. Leaf mulch suppresses weeds and fertilizes the ground. Mulched leaves will enrich your soil in the spring.You should be able to see about half of the grass through the chopped leaves if you want them to decompose quickly.  One you have collected the leaves, you can shred them for use in compost or mulch. Put the leaves into a large trash can. Then break them down with a weed whacker.You could use a leaf shredder instead.Leaves make great natural mulch. They don’t transfer black spores onto houses and buildings the way wood mulch does, which can damage siding and harm plants., Turn your leaves into “black gold!” Compost is excellent natural fertilizer for your lawn and garden. You may want to break the leaves down into mulch before putting them into the compost pile if you want them to decompose faster. You can use the decomposed leaves to fertilize your garden in the spring.You can leave your leaf pile to weather and add it to your compost pile in the springtime., Shred the leaves first. Then you can till the chopped leaves into the soil with a tiller. This will provide organic matter and nutrients to feed your lawn in the spring., Contact your local township, city or county and ask about an autumn cleanup policy. If they don’t have one, find out how to dispose of leaves and other backyard waste. Some county and city officials have specific regulations for you to follow when you cleanup a yard.Try asking, “Do you have a community recycling program for autumn leaves? Is there a municipal composting system with curbside pickup?” If there is no municipal program in place for autumn cleanup, ask how to dispose of general yard waste. In some towns you simply bag your leaves and put the bags at the curb so a designated party can pick them up on a specific day of the week. Other areas rake leaves into the street gutter and leaf collectors drive down each side of the road to collect them.  Your trees should seem healthy with no known fungal or other diseases. Bag your leaves and offer them to neighbors who may want mulch or compost. This can be especially helpful for neighbors with gardens or flower beds., You may choose to burn the leaves if you live in an area that permits this. You may need a fire permit to dispose of leaves in this way. Some states and towns require a member of the fire department to be present for the duration of the fire, while others require you to notify the fire department in advance.   Check with your locality by contacting them or searching their website for keywords like “burning” and “fire.”  , You can use fall leaves as fun craft projects. There are various ways you can preserve leaves. You can then use them to make bookmarks, coasters, wall art, candle holders, and many other crafts for kids or adults.	Mulch them into the lawn. Make mulch for gardens or flower beds. Compost them. Dig them in with a tiller. Ask your locality. Offer them to a neighbor. Burn the leaves. Make crafts.
These tend to offer a snug fit and are available anywhere from H&M to dance apparel stores. A jersey material will work well once you accessorize the look.You could also wear a long-sleeved black shirt. Try to get a V-neck or scoop-neck style shirt that fits closely around your body. Tuck the shirt into your pants to make your look more seamless.; , These should fit you snugly. Ideally, the material will be leather; however, you can still rock the Black Widow look with black jeans.  The boots should be black, have three buckles that wrap around the leg at three different heights, and have either a low or wedge heel.  The jacket should have a front zipper and fit you tightly. A leather jacket will most closely resemble Black Widow’s look, but a pleather or suede material will also work.  Finding pre-made bullet bracelets will not be an easy task, since they are an unusual item. However, you can create your own a number of different ways:   Purchase a bullet belt from an online retailer like Amazon or from a costume store. Cut it so that it is small enough to fit around your wrist, and superglue this smaller section of the belt to a black bangle bracelet. You will need 2 bullet bracelets, one for each wrist.Spray-paint crayons black and gold. The coloring should be gold from the pointy, coloring end of the crayon to the middle and black from the middle to the flat top. Let the paint dry and superglue the crayons to two bangle bracelets. Similarly-shaped items, like toy drop whistles, will also work well when painted.  You can buy gold Crayola crayons in bulk from an online retailer like Amazon. This way, you only have to paint half the crayon black.  This is an accessory that adds to Black Widow’s edgy, unique style. The thigh holster should wrap around your hips and will ideally have three pouches, as in the movie. You can find a thigh holster online by shopping for SWAT or Tomb Raider costumes at stores like Spirit Halloween.   You can also look up holsters at an army supply store like OPSGEAR or Army Surplus World. Alternatively, you could superglue a black cell phone pouch to a black heavy-duty strap and tie the strap around your thigh.  You can purchase a prop gun online from a store like Replica Airguns or from a costume store. A cheaper option would be to purchase a toy gun - even a water gun - and paint it black., In addition to the thigh holster, Black Widow wears a belt that sits higher on the waist. This belt is broad, made of cloth, and has a plain silver quick release buckle in the center.Amazon sells heavy duty law enforcement belts that resemble the one worn by Black Widow, but a regular military-looking belt will do.  You can find a close approximation to the black, leather biker gloves worn by Black Widow at most stores which sell motorcycle accessories. A cheaper option would be to wear cloth fingerless gloves., Online retailers like WigIsFashion or wigs.com sell red wigs for around $60. Choose a style that is slightly wavy so as to most closely resemble Black Widow., While more time-consuming and permanent than wearing a wig, dyeing your hair can look more realistic. Black Widow’s hair color is a burnt red, so aim to find a dye that is not too flashy - the more natural the color looks, the more believable your costume will be.A semi-permanent dye, which you can buy at a retailer like Sally Beauty, is a good option if you want to wear the costume multiple times in the span of a few days or if you want a temporary change of look, as it will last you three to six weeks but won’t flake., Black Widow’s wears minimal makeup, so all you have to do to get the right lip color is apply a medium pinkish or peach lipstick. Try to choose a lip color that subtly enhances your own rather than one that is too bright or that looks unnatural.  Black Widow doesn't wear much makeup, but a generous amount of mascara does make her eyes stand out. Double-coat your lashes or add fake eyelashes to enhance your Black Widow look.   Line your eyes with black eyeliner for even more definition.There are several tutorials on YouTube that you could use to guide your eye makeup application - simply look up “Black Widow makeup” to get the most relevant results.	Find a long-sleeved bodysuit or leotard. Wear a pair of black skinny jeans or leggings. Wear knee-length leather boots. Complete the look with a black moto jacket. Create bullet bracelets. Find a thigh holster. Get a fake gun. Wear a buckled belt. Add fingerless gloves to complete your look. Try on a red wig. Dye your hair. Apply lipstick. Put on mascara.
Making a playlist will depend on what software you're using to play music, whether online, on a mobile device, or on your computer. Making a playlist usually involves a simple drag-and-drop style of moving songs into the list, or you can select individual song files, right-click, and send them to the list. Start by making a blank list, then filling it with music you might like to include in a playlist to learn how it works.   Programs like Spotify and iTunes make creating playlists an easy and almost essential part of the music-listening experience. Project Playlist, Take 40, Windows Media Player, Grooveshark are also all good programs for managing your music. Pandora and other Internet radio stations let you create channels, but not specific playlists of songs.; , Get music by typing the name of any song, band or artist you like. You can also search just general types of music or artists to find new music or check out what your friends or other users on the site are listening to.   If you're using iTunes, you can either select music that's already in your library, which you own, or you can search the store and download any song you find for a price. If you've got iTunes, but no music, you can also upload your CDs into iTunes to "rip" the music directly. Going to the public library and loading the music into your iTunes library can be a great way of acquiring songs to make playlists on the cheap.  Mobile devices also allow you to create playlists instantaneously, by selecting songs and sending them to a playlist, or selecting "Play next," making you an instant DJ. You don't need to make playlists ahead of time, you just need to go with the flow.  Start with your favorite music genre first and add your favorite songs from a mixture of artists in that genre. The ultimate hip-hop playlist, classic rock playlist, and baroque classical playlist are all great ways of organizing your tunes.   Equally great is to pick a single artist to start with. If you've got all the records Bob Dylan ever recorded, that's a lot of tunes to sift through. Pick your 50 favorite songs from his career and organize them into a playlist of the greats. Alternatively, while it might make sense to stick to one genre, you don't have to. Try jumping all over the place. Throw some prog-jazz or some classical-folk-gothic fusion into the mix. Why not? There are no rules except what sounds good to you.  Playlists offer you a great opportunity to be like a curator at a museum, or like a DJ who tells a story with songs. Pick a mood, theme, or idea from which to organize your playlist. Make a playlist made of songs that all have "black" in the title, or a playlist of only love songs. Be creative. Some possibilities might include:   Break-up songs Monday morning songs Working songs Headphone songs Aggressive songs Trippy songs  , Another great way of creating a playlist is thinking about what you'll use the music for. Most music fans will want to listen to very different types of music at the gym, on a date, and when you're trying to relax at night. Create playlists and pick music that will fit each occasion. Some good occasion playlists might be:   Working out Driving to work Summer barbecue Dance party Meditation or relaxation  , Try making a playlist in which you pick songs you listened to during your Freshman year, or that you remember hearing on the radio when you were a kid. Make a playlist of songs you always remember your dad listening to, or songs you remember hearing on your way to after-school sports practice. Pick the songs that remind you of your best friend. Making a playlist is a great way of staying in touch with the past.   Try to tell a story with your playlist. How might you sum up your entirely middle school experience in ten songs? Give it a shot.  Many an awkward teenager has successfully wooed a date with a tastefully curated mix of love songs, and many an amateur DJ has packed the dancefloor with a properly selected group of dance jams. Consider the points of reference, the tastes, and the opinions of the people who'll be listening to the playlist, if anyone. If it's for you, just worry about what you like!  , Organize playlists around getting all the songs into a certain theme or era. For instance, you might create a playlist of the Top 100 Billboard songs from 1967, or a playlist of the complete Beatles songs. If you want, you could make a huge playlist of all the records that are on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Or make you own countdown list for fun.  The great thing about most apps and websites is that you can put the songs on shuffle, edit your playlist and add new music even when you're done, so you don't have to worry about the order yet. Nothing is set in stone, like on a CD or a mixtape. Start dumping all the songs you're considering including on the playlist in and worry about sorting them out later.   Alternatively, you could go with the mixtape approach, and go one song at a time, carefully selecting the movement of the playlist. This is especially good for dance mixes of headphones mixes.  Whatever your theme, genre, or taste, one thing about playlists is universal: it's got to start with a great song. Lead off with a song that'll hook everyone who'll listen, or will kick off your personal favorites playlist with a bang.Alternatively, maybe the order of the songs is predetermined (as in a countdown playlist) or maybe you're just not interested in a carefully selected order for the songs. Consider randomizing the order by hitting shuffle, or by tossing the songs in alphabetically for easy access. This tends to be easier for very long playlists.  In most cases, you'll want an awesome playlist to vary the mood, the tempo, and the tones in the music somewhat, or else it'll get repetitive and dull. Even if you're making a Best of Black Metal playlist, try to throw some more atmospheric headbangers in there, or it'll be hard to follow.   Alternatively, a party playlist should probably only go up, so start with a banger and progressively get rowdier. Likewise, a go-to-sleep playlist should stay relatively sedate. Let it fade off into white noise or silence at the ending.  Some songs have abrupt endings while others will have gradual fade-outs or codas. Some rock songs end with long blasts of feedback, while other songs will Listen to how each song transitions into the next.   Avoid aural schizophrenia. It's nice to have some variety, but going straight from Slayer to Simon and Garfunkel will sound strange. It's your playlist, but try to make the order relatively smooth. Slayer to Led Zeppelin's "Since I've Been Loving You" to Simon and Garfunkel? That's more like it.  You can put your playlist on your phone, iPod, CD or any other portable music device like a flash drive and take it out with you on a run, or to the gym, or to the party where you want to dance and try it out. Delete songs that don't work and add songs that enhance the experience that you're soundtracking. If that Cat Stevens song wasn't as relaxing as you wanted it to be, delete it and go softer. It's easy to make changes.	Select a music program that allows you to create a playlist. Upload music to work with. Make a playlist on the go. Start with a genre. Start with a theme. Start with an occasion. Be nostalgic. Start with an audience. Be a good organizer. Dump everything into one playlist. Start with a hook. Include some highs and lows. Listen to the transitions. Test it out.
Be sure you don’t overdo this eye-watering technique. Your eye is made up of many delicate parts, and rubbing too hard can cause damage, especially if done over a long period of time.   Be aware that this trick sets up a chain reaction that can lead to stinging eyes, creating a bloodshot appearance. You should only do this with clean hands to prevent the introduction of germs into your eyes., Your eyes’ natural response to dryness is to water to rehydrate and protect each eye. By keeping your eyes open for an extended period of time, your eye will become dry and start to water. You might even turn this into a game with a friend and have a starting contest., The stinging sensation caused by pulling on your lashes or pulling out your lashes should make your eyes water nicely. Though you shouldn’t intentionally pull out your lashes, you don’t have to worry if you do. Eyelashes, contrary to common belief, do grow back., When you yawn, the tension of the muscles in your eyes and face cause your tear ducts to close off for its duration. This causes a slight surge of fluid (tears) once you are finished and your yawning muscles relax. If you can make yourself yawn, your eyes should water., Though you shouldn’t stare into bright lights for long periods of time, as this can be harmful to your vision, some actors have used bright lights to trigger their eyes water. A famous example of this is actor Henry Fonda, who would often stare into bright lights when he needed to water up on stage.	Rub the area beneath your eyes gently. Dry out your eyes by staring. Grasp your upper eyelid and your lower eyelid by the lashes and pull. Yawn. Look into the lights.
Rather than trying to remember all the chords in every key, learn two, or even one, to start out with. The most important chord is an A chord. Luckily, this chord is also very simple to play. After the A chord, you might want to start learning the C chord. It may look confusing at first, but it's not too different from an A chord. Both of these chords are very important when playing the guitar. Learning just a few chords will mean you'll have less to remember and if you put all of your focus into them you probably won't forget them.; , When you memorize where your fingers go on both the A and C chords, try switching between the two. This doesn't have to be done quickly and should be practiced super slowly when you're starting out. Gradually, you'll speed up the transition between the two and learn how to play songs, you don't have to worry about that yet though. Just focus on "feeling" where your fingers should go and build up the muscle memory in your hands. It's hard to forget the chords when you spend ages playing them. You can also try saying the chord names out loud when you play them if it helps you.  A personal teacher will not only teach you the correct finger positioning and technique, they will also motivate you to practice what you're learning in lesson. You may be surprised about how much you can actually play when a teacher is telling you what to do. Don't only play in lessons though, you need to practice at home too. If you're worried about the cost of a one-on-one personal teacher, consider joining in at a group session. These can sometimes be cheaper and also allow you to communicate with other musicians. Some schools offer free guitar lessons to anyone that's interested, be sure to check that out too.  Chord diagrams show you exactly where to put your fingers and what fingers to actually use. These will help you understand what the chord shape is supposed to look like. Try to refer to these when you're stuck as opposed to Youtube videos and other Wikihow articles because they help you to visualize what the chord should look like when you play it. Stick these chord diagrams somewhere where you'll see them every day. This includes on your walls, on your wardrobe or on your actual guitar. Seeing them every day should help you to memorize them. Keep in mind that if you plan on playing your guitar out in public, chord diagrams will look very tacky on your instrument.  Learning songs that include basic chords should help you to memorize them much quicker than just playing the chords over and over. Try to learn a song that is simple but popular so you can play them to an audience of friends and family. A good song to learn in "Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol. This song is very popular and can be recognized by almost anybody. On top of that, is only has three chords (A, E and D) in it and repeats the same progression and strumming pattern throughout the whole song. This makes it easy to remember and sing along. Also, remembering what chords go in the song will also help you to remember what to chords look like and how they should sound.	Learn a few at a time. Practice switching between these chords. Get a teacher. Print out chord diagrams. Learn simple songs.
Alternatively, horehound can be grown by cuttings, which will take easily (just dust a little hormone powder on the end).; , Horehound will grow in poor soils but if the soil is rich, it will grow more vigorously and last longer.  Cover barely. , Regular watering after this is not necessary; the plants will fend well for themselves.  Remove any scraggly ones (you'll get plenty of vigorous growers).  After a year's growth, cut the horehound back by half. Remove the flowers to avoid self-seeding, as this plant can get away from you!	Obtain horehound seed. Select a spot in the garden with full sun. Sow the seeds shallowly (close to the surface). Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure.  , Water regularly until seedlings emerge. Thin seedlings to 45cm/18" apart. Prune.
Some pieces are very fast and harsh, while others are very graceful, slow and light. Some music is done with a voice, some with string instruments, and some with woodwind and brass. Knowing what kind you like to listen to will make it a whole lot easier to listen as well.; ,, You need to give it a chance to learn to like it. Listen to the notes, patterns, and small details. Notice what each instrument brings to the piece.  Try to pick out the sounds of individual sections like the strings, woodwinds, brass or percussion. Discerning these components of the music can increase your appreciation of the piece. Then pick out individual instrument and see if you can hear the part they play.  Consider the religious message behind the music and how that influences the sound.  Classical instruments include flute, clarinet, violin, viola, cello, oboe, and even classical guitar. Get a good classically-trained teacher to start off.	Understand that not all classical music is the same. Find out more about it, such as who it was composed by, whether it's been in any shows, and if it was appreciated at the time of its publishing.  , Be willing to listen. Try going to a live orchestral concert, choral concert, chamber concert, or band concert. Many churches, such as the Catholic church, have classical music influences in their liturgical music. You can also learn how to play classical music.
Bridges often fall out of place during tuning. To prevent this from happening, make sure you hold your bridge in place with one hand when tuning.  On occasion, you will need to replace the strings of your violin as they break and wear down over time. In this case, make sure to replace strings individually. Removing more than one string at once can cause the bridge to fall out of place., Take your violin back to the shop where you bought it, or bring it to a music shop. If you don't feel confident placing a bridge on your own, ask your instructor to do so, or get a professional do so for you despite the cost. A professional will sand it, make sure it's the right size for your instrument and will adjust the sound post.	Hold the bridge when tuning. Replace strings individually. It is best to have a professional place your bridge.
Heat 1 cup (250 ml) of water using a small saucepan or a tea kettle. Allow the water to reach a simmer, but not a full boil.; , Pour the hot water into a glass bowl. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt and 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of Borax. Stir to dissolve.You'll use this Borax solution to treat the base wick material. Treating wicks with Borax can make the candles burn brighter and longer. Moreover, it can also reduce the amount of ash and smoke produced by the burning process. Keep Borax away from children and pets since it can have a toxic effect when ingested or inhaled.  Take a piece of heavy cotton butcher's twine and submerge it in the Borax solution. Allow the twine to soak for 24 hours.   Make sure that the length of twine used is longer than the height of the container you plan to use for your candle. If you don't know how tall the candle will be, you can soak up to 1 foot (30.5 cm) of twine and trim it down to size later. Butcher's twine is a great base material for candle wicks, but nearly any thick cotton cord should work well enough. You can use embroidery cotton, torn pieces of cotton cloth, or a clean shoelace with the plastic cap removed.Soaking the twine for 24 hours will produce the best results. You can technically remove the twine after 20 minutes, but the results will not be as ideal.  Remove the twine from the Borax solution using tweezers. Hang the twine and let it dry for for two or three days.   The twine must be fully dry before you continue. Use a clothespin or similar clip to hang the treated twine in a warm, dry location. Place aluminum foil beneath the drying twine to catch any excess solution as it drips off.  Break apart 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 ml to 125 ml) of candle wax. Melt the wax using a double boiler setup.   If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a clean metal can and a small saucepan.  Heat 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water in the saucepan over your stove, letting it simmer and steam without boiling. Place the metal can inside the hot water. Wait another minute for the can to heat up before adding the wax.   Melted wax can cause serious burns, so handle it very carefully throughout the rest of the procedure.  Carefully dunk the dry, Borax-treated twine in the melted wax. Coat as much of the twine as possible.   Technically, you can use Borax-treated twine as it is without adding a wax coating. The wax makes the wick stiffer and easier to handle, however, and may also make it easier for the flame to catch on the end of the wick.  Hang the twine as before and let it dry long enough for the wax to harden. This should only take several minutes.   As before, place a sheet of aluminum foil beneath the hanging twine to catch any excess wax dripping off.  Dip and dry the twine once or twice more to build up a thick coating of wax.   Ideally, the twine should feel stiff while still retaining some flexibility. If you don't have enough wax to dip the string again, you can lay the string on a sheet of aluminum foil and carefully pour the remaining wax on top. Let the wick dry on the foil instead of hanging it again.  Once the fully-coated twine is dry, it's finished and ready to insert into a candle.	Heat the water. Dissolve the salt and Borax. Soak the twine in the solution. Dry the twine. Melt the wax. Dip the treated twine. Dry the twine. Repeat. Use the wick as needed.
Remove all your furniture using a furniture dolly or assistants. This will give you a better idea of the room's shape without the existing arrangement influencing your judgement.   If you don't have enough storage space, remove as much as you can, then place the remaining items in unobtrusive corners while you plan.; , Unless you consider your living room extra small, extra large, or an unusual shape, follow these guidelines. A few large pieces of furniture should make up most of the furniture by volume. End tables, ottomans, and similar small items should complement these and provide footrests and drink stands, not obstruct passage through the room or turn a pleasing arrangement into a busy mess.   For instance, a couch, an armchair, and bookcase can outline the usable space and set the color scheme. Two end tables and a small coffee table then serve useful functions and provide smaller objects for more visual interest without taking attention away from the larger pieces. See the Small Room and Large Room sections for advice on arranging unusually sized spaces. This can also apply if your living room is an odd shape, especially with angled walls that make the space appear too crowded or too spread apart.  Every room benefits from a center of attention, or focal point, which can be any object or area that attracts the eye and gives you something to orient your other furniture around.Without choosing something to draw attention, the overall design can look messy and unplanned, and there may be awkward spaces that make guests uncomfortable.   The most common focal points are up against one wall, such as a television, fireplace, or set of large windows. Place seating arrangement along the other three sides of the room, at right angles or angled slightly toward the focal point. If you don't have a focal point, or if you want to encourage more conversation, create a symmetrical arrangement of furniture, with seating on four sides. It is harder to accomplish an appealing design this way, however; consider decorating a bookcase or other tall piece of furniture instead to create visual harmony without distracting guests.  If all your sofas are pushed back against a wall, the room can seem cold and unwelcoming. Pull the furniture inward on at least two or three sides to create a more intimate area. Follow the guidelines for distance below, but feel free to adjust these if you prefer smaller or larger spaces.Allow 3 ft (1m) wide spaces where people will be walking. If you have energetic kids or household members who require extra space, increase this to 4 ft (1.2m). If you don't have the space to create walkways on three or four sides of the room, pull the furniture inward just enough place a lamp behind it, either standalone or standing on a narrow table. The light creates the suggestion of additional space.  Some of this comes down to personal preference, and you can always readjust to match your household's habits. Still, these simple design "rules" are a good place to start:   Coffee tables are typically placed 14–18 inches (35–45 cm) from seating. Shorten this distance if your household members have short arms, and lengthen this distance if they have long legs. If you have both types of people in your household, place the seating closer on two opposite ends and further on the third, or vice versa. Designers place side chairs 48–100 inches (120–250 cm) from the sofa as a default. Just make sure there's enough space to walk between them if you don't have sufficient room. Television placement varies greatly with size of room, eyesight of viewers, and personal preference. As a rough guide, begin by placing the seating facing the television three times further from the TV as the height of the screen. For instance, a 15-inch (40 cm) tall screen should be positioned 45 inches (120 cm) from the sofa and then adjusted to suit taste.  Symmetrical arrangements feel orderly and calm, and are great for resting the mind or low key activities. To create a room with bilateral symmetry, imagine drawing a line across the exact center of the floor; the furnishings on one side should be the mirror image of the furnishings on the other.   The most common symmetrical arrangement: a focal point in the center of one wall, a couch directly facing it on the other side, and two chairs or smaller couches on either side of the couch, facing inward. A coffee table and/or end tables complete the space. You don't need identical furnishings to pull this off. For instance, you can balance an L-shaped couch by placing a low end table on the opposite side of the "L" arm. The overall shape is more important than the exactly matching elements.  If one side of the room is different than the other, whether with completely different furniture or through smaller changes, the room seems exciting and has a sense of motion.This step is optional, but a minor asymmetry can add a nice touch even to a restful room.   Make small changes at first and keep adjusting until you find something you like. It's harder to create an appealing asymmetrical design than a symmetrical one, especially if you try to make it all in one go. For instance, place a bookshelf against a corner instead of in the center of the wall. If this seems uncomfortable, balance it out with less obvious symmetry, such as one or two small paintings on the opposite side of the wall. If you don't typically have many people in your living room, try placing seating only on two sides, in an L shape, with the center of attention on a third. The fourth side should contain the main entryway. This uses asymmetry to make it easy to reach the seating.  Using a furniture dolly or strong assistants, bring your furniture into the room without dragging it. Start with the largest, major elements. This helps you get a feel for the room piece by piece, adjusting further elements as you go.   If your design includes new furniture, start by placing the existing or major pieces before buying the smaller ones. You may discover you changed your mind partway through the arrangement.	Empty the room. For most living rooms, select a few large elements and a few small elements. Select a center of attention. Leave space between the walls and furniture. Place your furniture for convenient use. Use symmetry to create restful designs. Use asymmetry to add excitement. Place furniture elements one by one.
Congas can range in price dramatically between low-end and high-end models. Generally, higher-end congas will sound and feel better, which can lead to a more enjoyable time learning basic technique. For this reason, it may be preferable to purchase a single high-end conga as opposed to buying a set of 2 or 3 cheaper models. You can always expand your collection later.; , Congas are available in 3 distinct sizes (as determined by the diameter of the drumhead). From smallest to largest, they are referred to as the quinto, the conga, and the tumba. These drums are typically played in sets of 2 or 3. However, if you can only afford a single drum, buy the conga size, as it is the most versatile.   Occasionally you will see "requinto" drums that are even smaller than the quinto, or "super tumba" drums that are bigger than the tumba. These are rarer, specialty drums that shouldn't be considered by a novice player.  The body of the conga, the drum shell, will either be made from wood or fiberglass.   Wood is the traditional material, and lends a warm, full tone to the drums. It is preferred by most professionals, and is widely used on high-end models. The drawback to wood congas is that they don't project very loudly without the use of proper technique. Fiberglass congas are cheaper and more durable than their wood counterparts. They tend to have a thinner, brighter tone quality, but are more forgiving for novice players due to their clear projection.  The drum head (sometimes called a "skin") is the stretched membrane that you actually touch with your hands during play.   Traditionally, conga heads are made from animal skin. Rawhide is the standard, but very high-end models will feature buffalo skin. These heads lend a full, warm tone to the drum that complements a wood shell nicely. An alternative to a natural head is a synthetic head. These heads are made to mimic the tone of animal skin heads, but are cheaper and more durable. While the tone of these heads can be a bit thin, they do have a crisper, brighter projection, which suits them well to novice players.  After deciding on your desired specs, you can browse for congas. Online music retailers like Sam Ash and Musician's Friend will carry a wide selection of congas and allow you to read customer reviews. Classifieds sites or secondhand stores are an option if your budget is low - sometimes a used high-end conga can be purchased for less than a new budget model. Popular conga manufacturers are LP, Toca, and Remo.	Assess your budget. Determine which size of conga you want. Decide whether you would prefer a wood or fiberglass shell. Decide whether you want synthetic or natural heads. Browse for congas at music retailers or secondhand stores.

Take the measuring tape and drape it around the wearer’s neck. Get a comfortable measurement, not too loose or too tight. Keep in mind the ruff is going to fit right over the wearer’s shirt collar.   Determine how much linen you will need to buy. Look for evenweave handkerchief-weight linen. Go to your local fabric store and ask for samples of linen. For the best looking ruff, try to buy the most tightly-woven fabric available. Fabrics of this quality range from $12-$80 per yard, so buy linen based on your budget. Be wary of Chinese linen, woven from a very short staple fiber and prone to wrinkling. Irish, German, and Italian linens are all good options.  Wash it in hot water. Let it dry and then press it with an iron., You’re looking for the true grain of the linen. You don’t want to cut strips from the length-wise grain, as these strips won’t spring up from the neckband of the ruff properly.   Draw the thread and then cut along this line. Continue to pull the thread with the needle to get it started.  A 3” wide strip produces an average 1570s ruff with a finished depth of around 2 ½”.  Hold them so the edges meet. Thread the needle. The, use a whip stitchto attach them. Try to catch the smallest amount of thread possible at the edge of each piece of linen.   If you do the stitch properly, the stitch should be barely visible from the exposed side of the linen pieces. There should be a slight ridge on the back side of the linen pieces. Continue to attach pieces of linen together with whip stitches.  This will stop them from unraveling. Try to use the least amount of thread possible as you do not want to add bulk to the ruff.   Avoid using a zigzag stitch to finish the edges. The ruff will look less authentic.  Use a gathering stitchto form the pleats of the ruff.   Run the first line of gathering stitches about ⅛” from the unhemmed edge. Run another line of gathering threads about ¼” away from the first line of stitches. Create two to four lines of gathering stitches total. Keep the fabric flat as you make the stitches. Leave a 10” to 12” tail on either end of the linen.  Always make the neckband a bit bigger than necessary as the ruff can be bulky. You don’t want the neckband to be too tight, but it should fit snuggly.   It may help to gather up the ruff and loop it around your neck. Then, use a measuring tape to measure the length. Don’t be surprised if the measurement is larger than you thought, as the bulk of the ruff can add up to 2” to your neck measurement. For a 15” x 2” neckband, start with a rectangle that is 16” x 8”. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, and press it with an iron. Unfold the fabric and then fold the two long edges toward the center crease line. Press this fold with an iron. The fabric strip should now be 4” wide. Unfold the strip and then fold it under ½” on the short ends, towards the inside. Press the folds. Refold the two long edges down toward the center fold line and then bring the two long folded over edges together. The neckband should now be 15” x 2”. Press the neckband well. You can use some starch to hold the creases, if desired.  Use your needle and thread. Divide the ruff into workable units.   For a 15” neckband, for example, mark three 5” sections on the neckband. Gather the ruff to 15” and adjust the pleats so they are even. You can hit the finished, gathered ruff with a shot of steam from an iron to keep the pleats in place. This will make the ruff easier to attach to the neckband. Whipstitch the neckband to the pleated ruff. Work from the center of the neckband to the short ends. Make sure the end of the ruff stops just shy of folded under the short end of the neckband. Once you have completed all the stitching, tie a square knot to the gathering threads. Clip them to about 1” and tuck the tails back into the neckband. Finish the short ends by whip stitching them as close to the edge as you can.  Sew 12 to 18 inches of narrow ribbon or cord to each end of the ruff. This will help the wearer tie on the ruff and secure it.  Be warned that the ruff will likely collapse when it gets wet. So wash linen ruffs in hot water. Then, dry the ruff by rolling it in a dry towel. Linen absorbs a lot of water, so you may need to use a large towel.   Don’t wring out wet linen. Instead, hang dry the ruff.  There are two methods of starching:Cold starch: dissolve raw starch in water and apply it to the fabric. The starch is then “cooked” (turns into a gel) when the linen ruff is ironed. This produces a nice stiff finish, but requires skill so you don’t scorch the fabric or end up with cloth stuck to the iron. Using boiled starch: Mix two tablespoons of starch (corn, wheat, or rice) in 1 cup of water. Either microwave the starch on high or heat it on the stove. Stir it until it becomes thick and transparent. Regardless of the method, starch should always be applied to damp, not dry, linen, so it can penetrate the fibers. Work the starch into all of the folds. Then, gently shake out the excess starch. But make sure there is a rather thick coating on the ruff. Let the ruff dry. Open up the pleats as the ruff is drying so they don’t stick together.	Measure the wearer’s neck. Pre shrink the linen. Use a needle to pull the thread from the linen. Cut strips of linen that are 3” wide. Place two pieces of linen together. Use the sewing machine to finish the raw edges of the linen. Gather the linen pieces to form pleats. Construct the neckband. Attach the ruff to the neckband. Add the ties to the ruff. Take care of the linen ruff. Starch the ruff to keep it pleated and springy.
Stripes are a simple, baby-friendly design that are easy to create yourself with some paint and paint strips. Lay the paint strips over the wall to paint on your first shade. Let this shade dry completely and then fill in the bare spots with your second color. This is a quick, easy, low-cost design that works great for a nursery., The busier you make your decorations, the more expensive they'll be. Focusing in on a single focal point can save you money. Instead of having many decorations spread across the room, pick something like a large area rug for the center of the room. This will draw attention to a single spot in the room, making it look decorative while saving you money on excess decorations.Look for cheaper items for your focal point as well to save even more money. Check secondhand stores and discount websites to find the centerpiece you want.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend on professional supplies, decorate on your own. Even if you're not artistically inclined, things like stencils are easy enough to use.If you want a decorative dresser, for example, buy one secondhand. Paint it yourself and then stencil on the designs you want. Use chalkboard paint. You can use colorful chalk to draw any designs you want. As your baby gets older, they'll be able to experiment with painting and drawing on the wall.  When you're having a baby, you may receive a lot of toys your baby is not old enough to use. While you're waiting for the toys to be safe for your baby, use them as decorations. This will save you money buying knick-knacks for shelves and drawers.Fill in bare spots in your bookshelf with stuffed animals. For example, a stuffed owl could be placed on the bookshelf. Place things like figurines, plastic dolls, and action figures on mantels and dressers.  You can save on buying decorative items by doubling up and making your storage devices decorations. Go for things like decorative baskets, shelves, and floor storage. This can spruce up the room and add a splash of color without making you go over-budget on expensive decorations.You can also paint duller items in your nursery. For example, a yellow dresser can brighten up a room. Try painting a neutral-color piece of furniture in a bright, kid-friendly shade.  Your decorations do not have to come from a store. You can fill the nursery with personal decorations. Hang up family photographs. If you have other children, have them make artwork for the new baby.Feel free to get creative. Make a collage, for example, of family photos. Arrange family photos and mementos in a frame, using decorative paper for the background.	Choose stripes for the wall. Create one focal point. Encourage DIY decorations. Use toys as decorations. Go for decorative storage. Use personal decorations.
If there isn't enough water coming into the bowl to thoroughly clean it out, it probably means that not enough water is getting into the tank in the first place. Find the floating arm and try bending it up slightly to allow more water to fill into the tank.   Be careful not to raise it too far past the overflow tube, or the tank will run constantly.  After shutting off the water and flushing the tank, check to make sure the valve isn't closing too soon, shutting off more water from getting into the bowl. If it is, adjust the rod arm or the chain.   There should be three or four different height settings to allow the assembly to customize to your toilet. Try different settings until enough water flows into the toilet.  These will often become clogged with mildew or rust because it's a difficult area of the toilet to clean. Take a toilet brush with toilet cleaner to the underside of the rim to make sure enough water can get through the ports.   To see if they're clogged without sticking your head in the toilet, use a small mirror and check them out in the reflection. You can also use a wire hanger to clean the ports out if there's anything lodged in there you can't get out with a brush.  Generally, a pipe connects them. Look at the base of the tank and check the nuts to see if they need tightening, replacing, or new washers.   If part of the tank or bowl is cracked or leaking, this may result in a weak flush or other problems and you may need to replace the toilet completely.	Check the water level in the tank. Check the flush valve at the bottom of the tank. Check the water ports on the underside of the toilet bowl rim. Check to see if the joint that connects the tank to the toilet bowl is leaking.
If you and your friend have pink tails, you could call it Pearl Pink Tails or something. If it's about you and your best friends moving somewhere, like Malibu, you could call it Malibu Mermaids. Make it unique, and make sure you don't copy anyone.; , You can't have a show without people! You may want to have some humans and some mermaids, or all mermaids. Also, decide if you are land mermaids or sea mermaids. Did you become a mermaid or did you become a human. Does your family live in the sea or on land? You should decide.  Every mermaid show needs decent tails. If you want, make one! There's some great YouTube videos that provide instruction. If you want a simple tail, use leggings and a pillowcase. If you want a medium tail, use waterproof material, a tail pattern and a Mono fin. If you want a Professional tail, buy one from Mermaigica.com or FinFun.com  , What are their character's names? What are they like? What is their background?  , If you want a good show, have someone who's good with computers. Consider having someone to film it and someone to edit it.  Your parents may not want 7 kids in their house, all with mermaid tails and such.  You have to have something to work with. You can't just shove a bunch of people in front of a camera and expect them to be word perfect. Make sure everyone knows his or her lines.  You don't need professional cameras. You could use your iPhone, your iPad, and your tablet's camera.  Don't just pick any random person. See who's the best. Make sure to pick someone who can supply their own tail, unless you have spares.  Make sure no one gets bored.  For example - Scales and Tails-Season 1 Episode 1- New Start, New Tail.  For example - Scales and Tails - Season 2 - Episode 1 - Back to Malibu	Decide on the name of your show. Get actors/actresses. Have some type of tails. Develop good characters. Have a 'Technical Person.', Make sure you have your parent's permission. Write the script. Get a camera. Hold Auditions. Have Fun. When you edit the video, make sure to give it a title. Make seasons!
You should have the boat itself (the hull), the dagger board, the rudder and tiller, your mainsheet, both mast pieces, boom, boom bang and sail in one place.; , The bottom of the top half just slides into the top of the bottom half. There are no locks, or anything, it should just fit snugly.  There will be a pocket along one side of the sail to slide over the mast. , This is the hardest part of the entire rigging process, so be careful, no-one likes a broken mast or hull. You stand up the mast, make sure it's right next to the bow of the laser, and pick it straight up off the ground, and put it into the mast step (the hole at the front of your laser). A way to make this easier is to grab the mast around the middle, then walk forward thereby pushing the sail up. While walking you should also move your top hand up to have better control of the mast.   The sail should now be flapping in the wind.  Hold it in there, as it will fall off without any other support.  Grab the outhaul (the line on the very end of the sail), and put it through the eye at the end of the boom. Now run the line down the boom, and cleat it off.   If you have cleated the outhaul properly, the boom should now stay up on its own. , Supposing it is already rigged itself, you only have to attach it to the bottom of the mast, then slide it into the little metal clip on the bottom of the boom. Now pull down on the hanging line, and then pull straight up to cleat it.  Take one end of it, go to the end of the boom, and tie it around the eye on the bottom of the pulley there. Do not put it through the pulley itself; you're going to need that pulley in a moment. Now that it's tied off, find the other end of your line, and run it through the traveler on the stern of the boat. Then run it back up, through the pulley on the end up the boom, then forward across the bottom of the boom, through that metal loop, through the next pulley, and then down through the main block at the front of the cockpit. Make sure that your main block clicks when you pull the mainsheet through it - if it doesn't, you have to run the mainsheet through the other side of the main block. Then tie a knot in the very end of the mainsheet, so the line can't run back through the main block when you are sailing or if you capsize.  Then attach the rudder, tiller and daggerboard. Slide the rudder pins into the eyes on the backside of the laser, and make sure that the clip is holding it down.   Test it by pulling up on the rudder. Then put on the tiller by sliding it into the space on the top of the rudder. Once it's in, insert the pin to hold it there. Tie the dagger board with a long loop of elastic to the eye at the very front of the boat. Verify the elastic creates enough friction that the daggerboard will stay up or down (even when you invert the boat).  The last thing you need to do, just before you start sailing, is tie down the rudder. There is a tiny string, found anywhere around the rudder and tiller, that you have to pull on to bring down the rudder. Once it's down, tie off the string on the cleat that is on the side of your tiller, and you're set to sail!	Get all your parts together. Put together both the pieces of your mast. Slide the sail over the mast. Insert the battens into the sail, they should slide in and then you push your end of the batten down so it won't fall out.  , Stand up the mast. Get your boom, and put its front end into the gooseneck (the little pin sticking out of your mast). While still holding the boom on the gooseneck, walk around to the flapping end of the sail. Attach the clew-tie-down (a small line that wraps around the ring the outhaul is attached to) and wrap it around the boom and tie it so that the clew is as close to the boom as it can be while still being able to slide back and forth along the boom.  , Attach the boom vang (This piece holds the boom down while you're sailing). Rig the mainsheet. Just before you put the laser in the water, check to be sure the hull plug is screwed into the drain hole in the stern. Launch.
, Remember you should Choose a device with a longer battery life for vehicle tracking purposes.  If you click on the "low Battery Notification" other two options will be highlighted.   Set Battery level - It will Notify on user defined battery level. For example if you set 15% GhosTrack will start to notify when the phone battery is 15%. Notify Ghost - It means GhosTrack will start to notify any user defined ghost (member) when battery drained to user defined level. So this two options are very useful for vehicle tracking. If you set those on the device of your car, it will start to notify you when the battery level is alarming. View the tracking history. And this tracking history means where your car traveled. So its pretty much important too.  Someone means someone from your ghost list. So if there is a privacy issue you can easily cancel the tracking option.

Click the option "Track Me" means you are actually enabling the feature that someone can track you. * Enter Minimum Time (Minute); Means you can modify your tracking by defining time.
Since transplanting the seedlings is hard on the plant, it's important to make sure they are strong enough to be moved. To check this, see if your herb seedlings have grown their “true leaves.” This should be the plants’ second set of leaves, which will be fuller and frond-like, as opposed to the thin and stringy nature of their first set of leaves. They should appear after 5-6 weeks.You can also check to make sure the herb seedlings have formed a ball of roots, but this can be difficult to do without removing the plant from its pot or pellet.; , You should do this about two hours before you try to transplant your seedlings. You want the plants to be as strong as possible before being moved so they are more likely to grow once transplanted. The water will make sure the soil is loose and easy to break apart, which will help you transfer your seedlings quickly. Be careful to use just enough to make the soil moist. , You should use moist potting soil and make sure you have enough room at the top for the seedling’s stem base to come up just below the top of the pot. This should be 1 to 2 inches below the pot’s rim depending on the size of your seedlings. You also want to make sure you aren't packing the soil. It shouldn’t be loose, but you don't want it compacted or it will be difficult for the roots to continue forming.   You can also add rocks to the bottom of your pot to help drain the water. Try to stick to pots between 6”-8” for single plants and 10” and up for multiples.  If your seedlings are in a small planting pot, place your hand over the soil with the seedling in between your fingers. Then gently turn the pot upside down and shake it till the soil dislodges. However, if your seedlings are in pellets, simply peel off the skin around the soil., You can do this with your hands or a trowel. If you are planning to transplant more than one seedling, make sure you have enough space to make multiple holes without overcrowding the plants. Each hole should be deep enough for the seedling’s ball of roots.   If you are unsure of how many seedlings to put in each pot, a common rule to remember is that a pot that is 8 inches or smaller should have only one plant, and one that is 10 inches or larger can have multiple plants.  Once placed, move the soil back in over your seedling, and pat it down lightly. Remember, you want the soil tight, but not too compacted. You should also make sure that your seedling isn’t buried. You should be able to see its leaves and a little bit of its stem.  You want to water towards the base of your seedlings, since pouring water over their leaves can be damaging. You should also water them until you see some of it drain out of the bottom of your pot. If you are using a pot without holes in the bottom, try to watch the edges of the soil for water bouncing back upward. If you see this, you’ve used too much.  You don’t want to put them into direct sunlight until they adjust to their re-potting. Direct light and heat will damage the plant and may prevent it from growing. Instead, try gradually introducing the seedlings to sunlight a little at a time., Even after transplanting, you should make sure to check on the growth of your seedlings regularly. You want to make sure that the roots have grown and taken hold in the pot. You can try and check this by turning your plant’s pot on its side and gently tapping to dislodge the root ball. However, if your plant is showing positive signs of growth it is likely to have taken root in its new home.	Make sure your herb seedlings are ready. Water your herb seedlings. Put dirt in the pot you’ll be using. Remove your seedlings from their pots or pellets. Make a small hole in your potting soil. Put your seedlings into the hole. Water your seedlings. Place your seedlings in the sun. Check on your seedlings.
Get comfortable playing in front of a crowd. You’ll likely have to play a lot of non-paying gigs before you can land any playing ones.   Perform at open mics. Volunteer to play at retirement homes. Busk (play on the street) if it’s allowed in your city.  Plan out your live show. You want to make sure you have a great stage presence as to go along with your music. Find out what you can do to make your show more engaging.Add personal stories to go along with your songs. Tell jokes. Learn dance moves that will help your audience get into the music. Have a light show to go with your music.  Rehearsal is different than practicing your songs. You want to rehearse everything you’ll be doing in your show. Make your performance tight. Practice engaging with the audience.  Contact booking agents in your area to try to secure gigs. Give them your demo and a link to your website so can hear your music and decide whether it fits their venue. Booking agents are constantly being approached by musicians so it can sometimes take weeks or months for them to get back to you. Remind them politely by email periodically that you’d still like to play at their venue.Be honest about your draw. Don’t say you can bring in more audience than you’re sure you can. When you do book a gig, always be on time and be respectful of the crew.  Try to talk to people who enjoy your show to make new fans. Show them where they can go to find your music. Have them join your mailing list. You may even meet people who have skills and can help you further your career. Getting your music heard is all about connecting with people who want to support you.   Be organized. Have a list of the people in the music industry you meet and what they do. Stay in touch. Maintain relationships with the people you meet in the industry. They’re more likely to help you spread your music if they feel like you like them.	Play as much as you can. Create a show. Rehearse your show. Book gigs. Meet people.
You don’t want to purchase seats that you think are great and end up having a blocked view. See if the venue’s online seating chart mentions where obstructions of view occur. If it doesn’t, contact the venue.   Try asking, “Which seating areas have obstructed views? Could you tell me where I can find a map that marks which parts of the seating chart have unobstructed views of the stage?”; , The internet is full of articles and reviews about the best places to sit at specific venues. Go to a search engine and type in the name of the venue. Then add the keywords “best seats” and search the web.   There are interactive seating charts online for many venues. Open a seating map through a website like SeatGeek or Ticketmaster. When you select a specific seating area, the chart will open an image of what it will look like from the vantage point of those seats.  Box seats are generally better in the middle; if they’re off to the side you may only be able to see part of the stage. Box seats offer the advantage that there won’t be audience members ahead of you blocking your view. Typically there is more room in box seats as well. Well-placed box seats can be the best seats in the venue.Box seats may even be closer to restrooms and refreshments – consult with a map of the venue.  If so, the balcony will be higher up and further from the stage. The balcony seats will probably be the cheapest choice, but won’t be great seats. You would probably need to bring binoculars or opera glasses. If the theater has just a single upper level, it’s usually called the “balcony.”The first couple of rows in the mezzanine are usually closer to the stage than orchestra seats. From the mezzanine you can see the entire stage.  Venues that are designed like classic Greek theatres, for example, have upper balconies that protrude out over the last several rows of ground floor seats. This design actually muffles the sound those ground floor seats receive.It can also obstruct your view of the top of stage sets., If tickets are tough to get, you might have to opt for whatever seats you can snag. There can be advantages to upper level seats. You may not want to choose upper level seats if you have vertigo or a fear of heights that’s easily triggered.   You should be able to see the whole stage, although it will be a distance away. There may be a big screen where you can see up-close shots of the band. You’ll likely be on an incline so that the people in front of you won’t block your view. Sound floats upward well to balconies.Snag a side view. Tiered riser sections in front of the stage on the right or left can offer good views and sound. Being on an angle helps you to see when you’re sitting and other people are standing., If you’re short and get floor seats, you may not be able to see with people standing in front of you. Avoid orchestra seats in the center if you’re short. You could be blocked by large or tall people in front of you, and without an angled view you won’t be able to look around them.If you’re tall, floor seats and centralized orchestra seats should be fine for you. However, consider getting an aisle seat if you have long legs, as it might be difficult for people entering and leaving their seats to get past you.  Floor seats are usually the most expensive seats, but are also considered some of the worst seats – it all depends on your personality. What is the vibe of the crowd that the performers attracts? Is it likely to be a laid back or highly energetic crowd?Would you expect a mosh pit to occur up front? For example, heavy metal, rock and rap concerts often have moshing, as well as some hip-hop concerts. People in the floor seat area may crowd together, sweat, and even be pushy. They will often be holding up cell phones to capture footage. If you want an active, electric feeling and don’t mind the scene being intensely social, floor seats may work for you., If all you care about is being as close to the performers as possible, and price is no object, then front row seats may be your preferred choice. Keep in mind that if you have seats up front, you may not be able to see everything. The stage’s height is one factor: it can be high for shows at big stadiums. The stage may be obstructed by production equipment.If you’re sitting in the front row, you’ll probably be looking up most of the time and may get a sore neck. The second or third row is often better than the front row. If you want to choose the front row, consider sitting to the right or left instead of the center, as you will likely have a clearer view of the stage., If your top priority is sound, consider middle central seating. Surfaces towards the front, back and sides of the venue can break up the acoustics, especially by walls. Look for seats near the soundboard: engineers will mix sound for the entire location based on what they’re hearing.Sound waves mostly project in the direction they’re pointed, so if you find out where the speakers are, aim to be in their line of sight for the best sound.  Check for presales, for example through the band’s fan club, or promotional offers on the artist’s website. Find out exactly when the tickets will be going on sale to public. That way if you can’t score presale tickets, you’ll be ready to try the public sale as soon as it opens.   Sign up for email lists of local radio stations, venues, and the band’s website so that you’ll be notified about any upcoming contests or special offers. You can also opt to get notifications from any of those sources’ official social media profiles.  You have a better chance to get good seats if you buy less tickets, especially if you’re buying just one. You could always carpool with other concert attendees and then split up to your different seats at the venue. Make sure to have a plan for where to meet back up after the show.  Don’t reload the page on the same device. If you get a “wait” icon that indicates your computer is connecting to the site, you should wait. If you reload the page, you can lose your place in the virtual line. You can, however, try connecting with a different device while you’re waiting for the browser to load.Avoid sharing a Wi-Fi network, which can slow you down. Don’t try to use multiple browsers on the save device, or the website may think you’re a robot and block your IP address.  If you can afford them, get VIP tickets. These are often the best seats in the house, and come with extra perks. For example, you might get an autograph, a meet-and-greet with the artist, or a fan club membership.  Generally, seats become less expensive the farther they get from the stage. However, that’s not always the case. Sometimes seats are priced higher just so that they don’t appear to be bad seats to the buyer.If there are different prices for seats in the same section and row, go with the cheaper tickets., You may want to get more than one phone ready to call with. Practice hanging up and redialing with each phone. Landline phones will have a different way of disconnecting and redialing than cell phones do.  If you’re willing to buy tickets for another, unrelated show, it can give you a leg up on the competition. Call a bit before ticket sale time, and select the option that lets you buy tickets through a human operator. When the sales representative answers, order tickets  for a show that is available already, since the tickets you really want will not be on sale for another few minutes.   Since you’ll already have the representative on the line, you can ask her for tickets to the other concert once the proper time is reached. This way you won’t have to spend time trying to get through on the phone when ticket sales begin, because you’ll already be connected to a live representative. Say that you want the best tickets available for the second show.  If you haven’t been able to get tickets by the day of the show, find out from the theater if there are any unclaimed house seats. These prime seats are reserved for creative teams, producers and artists, and if any are unclaimed the VIP seats may be sold to the public.This sale can happen as early as when the box office opens, up to as late as an hour before the curtain goes up.  It’s important to arrive early because general admission tickets may not be a guarantee of seating. Also, they are first come, first serve, and you want to get the best seats you can! General admission tickets are seating or standing areas without assigned seats. There may be section, row, or seat numbers on the tickets, but if they say “General Admission” than the numbers are for inventory purposes and don’t represent your actual seats.The doors may open an hour or even several hours before the show begins. Plan to get there as early as possible and wait outside for the venue to open if necessary.  “Seat poaching” happens in places like concerts and airplanes, and is discouraged by the respective authorities. It isn’t fair to other people who are staying in their assigned seats. Furthermore, you can be tracked down by ushers and get in trouble with the venue.   Empty seats may be meant for accessibility for disabled people, or reserved for employees who will come and go., Sometimes tours, fan clubs or venues will have seat upgrade contests, which you can search for online. In some instances, tour staff may approach people who are already seated far away from the stage and give upgrades to loyal fans who can answer band trivia. You can also install an app, such as Pogoseat, that gives you the ability to request concert seat upgrades.  It may seem counterintuitive, but earplugs can actually help you to hear better at a concert. They take the edge off the sound so that you can enjoy it. They also reduce your chances of ringing in the ears and hearing loss.	Find out where visual obstructions are. Research where the best seats are at the venue you’re attending. Look for centralized box seats. Find out if the venue has both a mezzanine and a balcony. Avoid rows below upper balcony overhangs. Consider upper-level seats. Consider your height. Think about the audience before choosing floor seats. Weigh pros and cons of front row seats. Select seating for optimum sound. Buy early. Split up your seats. Buy through a ticket distributor’s website or app. Shop for VIP packages. Don’t assume a high price means good seats. Verify the telephone number if you’re calling in for tickets. Purchase other tickets first. Check on the day of the show. Show up early for general admission tickets. Don’t plan to ditch your seats for closer ones. Look for upgrades. Bring earplugs.
Switch off the socket that is connected to the power supply. Unplug the line voltage power cord from the socket.  Remove the CPU casing. Unplug the low voltage cables that are connected to the drives and motherboard. Remove any CPU cards that may obstruct your view of the power supply., Generally, the power supply is held in place by 4 torx screws. Unscrew them using the torx screwdriver and remove the power supply from the CPU., The warranty is a stamped sticker that is on one of the edges of the power supply. It consists of the warranty date, a bar code and a ‘pass’ stamp. If the warranty has expired, cut across the sticker safety seal and open the power supply case., The fuse is usually located on one corner of the power supply. Use an ohm meter to check the fuse. If the ohm meter is showing readings below 0.1 ohms, or if there is resistance on the meter, then you will know that the fuse has blown., Plug in the soldering iron and heat it to about 700 degrees. Touch the tip of the soldering iron to the tin wires on either side of the fuse. As the solder softens, gently push the fuse away from the circuit board. Once the soldering is complete, you can remove the fuse., Buff each end of the fuse with emery paper to dull the plating. Take the six inch long stripped 24 gauge wire with flux and tin it with resin solder. Tin the ends of the fuse, after which you can solder the wires to the ends., Use the wire cutter to remove any excess pins from the board. Also, cut the gauge wire with only an inch of space from the fuse joint., Place the new fuse onto the circuit board and solder it into place with the soldering iron. Once this has been completed, use the ohmmeter to test the fuse., Once the fuse is showing good readings on the ohmmeter, close the power supply case. Keep it back into the CPU and screw it in. Replace the CPU casing and plug it in for use.	Unplug the Power Supply. Open and Unplug the CPU: Use a torx screwdriver to remove the torx screws of the CPU. Unscrew the Power Supply. Check the Warranty. Examine the Fuse. Charge the Soldering Iron. Solder New Pins to the New Fuse. Trim the Wires and Circuit Board Pins. Solder the New Fuse. Reinstall the CPU.
Even in high school, you can take certain classes that will prepare you for plumbing. A number of high schools offer vocational training for upperclassmen. Ideal courses would be in plumbing and heating. You can still prepare yourself by enrolling in classes in math, physics, and computer technology.You may also want to take classes in drafting and blueprint reading, if your school offers them.; , You’re required to complete high school or get your GED to enroll in vocational training and apprenticeships. People working in your school’s career center may have connections and available programs for you.   Take advantage of the resources available to you.  Survey the available community colleges in your area. Depending on the school, you may be able to attend any state community college. Pick a school that has a program that specializes in plumbing. Some schools offer one year vocational degrees while others offer a two associate's degree.If you’re unsure about the options available, talk to your high school’s counseling services. Certain high schools have resources for advising and contacting colleges.  Once you find a plumbing program at a trade school, technical or community college, you’ll need to sign up for classes. You'll earn a certificate that covers water supply and drainage systems, as well as piping equipment. It is not necessary to get a degree in plumbing, but many companies and state agencies prefer it.   Not all plumbers get their vocational training in this manner.  Depending on the school you decide on, you might be able to take courses that specialize in niche areas of study. There is a major shift towards water conservation today and many businesses want plumbers who specialize in this.	Take relevant classes. Get your high school diploma or GED. Research higher education. Enroll in vocational training. Take specialty programs.
Some good places to store these lights would be your living room, kitchen and at least one of the bedrooms.   These emergency light sources can include battery operated flashlights, hand cranked or rechargeable flashlights, or candles. Always be sure that you keep extra fresh batteries and/or matches on hand.; , The radio should have an alternate power supply such as hand-cranking or batteries.This way, you will be able to hear important weather updates, as well as know what the current time is.  Cordless phones only operate when electricity is present and extended outages can drain cellphones.  Include a few days of prescription medications, if needed.   You should also include specialty items for infants or seniors. These items should include formula, extra diapers and extra battery packs for breathing apparatuses.  You might also consider a portable heater or firewood if you have a fireplace or wood stove. This is needed for a winter blackout, as once the power goes out, the heat won't work, so it is important that you try your best to stay warm.  This should include tools such as a hammer, screwdriver and duct tape. During the winter, it should also include, in addition to the tools, snow removal equipment and rock salt or sand for traction.	Have at least one backup light on each level of the house. Buy an emergency radio and a battery or windup alarm clock for your home. Have a land line phone to notify the power company of an outage, and make emergency phone calls. Stock a first aid kit with over-the-counter medications, bandages and antiseptics. Have extra blankets and sleeping bags on hand. Assemble a basic tool kit for any emergency fixes in the house that need to be done.
Strong, healthy plants will be more resistant to diseases of all kinds, so the fight against rose disease starts at planting time. Select healthy rose plants that have sturdy-looking leaves and stems and don’t show any signs of disease or pests.   Look to see if any of the leaves have black spots, red leaves, or chew marks. These are all signs of disease or infestation.; , Despite their name, Midnight Blue roses actually prefer sun to shade. They need about 6 hours of direct sunlight a day to be at their best, though they will still survive in very bright shade.Container rose bushes should receive a minimum of 4 hours of direct sunlight a day.  Roses have an easier time growing in soil that drains easily and does not hold water. Avoid planting them anywhere you’ve seen puddles form.  Midnight Blue roses are not particular about soil type or pH, so there's no need to perform any soil tests., If you’ve purchased a rose bush that isn’t in a container of soil, soak the roots overnight in a bucket of water. This will rehydrate the root system before you plant the bush., The hole needs to be wide enough and deep enough to hold the roots when they're all the way spread out. Aim for a size of about 2 feet (60 cm) wide and 2 feet (60 cm) deep.If you come across weeds or stones as you’re digging, use a garden fork to turn the soil over and remove them. Pull up anything that won't allow the roses’ roots to venture freely. If planting multiple shrubs, space them at least 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) apart to allow space for growth.  Roses love soil that is enriched by manure, so incorporate some into the soil where you intend to plant your rose bush. You can purchase well-rotted manure at your local garden store.   Be sure the manure is at least 3-4 years old, since new manure can burn the roots of roses.Try to incorporate roughly a bucket full of manure per square meter of soil.  The graft union, which is the little swollen area between the roots and the stems, should be at or just below the soil level. If it’s too high, you’ll need to dig the hole deeper. If it’s several inches below the soil line, add more soil and manure below the roots. Then spread the roots out in all different directions and refill the displaced soil.Placing a long stick across the top of the graft union will help you see if it’s level with the soil line before you begin to fill the hole back in.  Saturate the area around the rose bush to remove any air pockets, settle the soil, and get water to the roots immediately. Stop when you see a puddle of water starting to form at the base of the plant., Organic mulch should be spread over the dirt around a Midnight Blue rose bush to help retain moisture in the soil and keep weeds from growing. Apply a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7 cm) layer, and maintain this level throughout the plant’s life.Use shredded bark mulch that has been properly processed to remove insects and diseases. Pre-packaged mulch that is sold at garden centers is the safest bet. It should state right on the bag that it has been composted or sterilized.  To water your roses, wait until the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. Then give it a good, long soak to encourage your Midnight Blue rose bush to develop deep water-seeking roots that will help it survive drier periods in the future.In a hot, dry climate where temperatures rise to 80 or 90 °F (27 or 32 °C) or higher, your roses should be given 6 to 8 gallons (22 to 30 L) each week. You may need to water your roses every two or three days. In a more moderate climate, you will most likely find that you only need to water your rose bush once a week. Three to four gallons (11 to 15 L) should be sufficient. To prevent fungal growth, water in the morning to allow the leaves adequate time to dry out during the day.  Foliar feed is a liquid plant food that is sprayed directly onto the leaves. In addition to providing the plant with nutrients, it also helps protect against disease. Begin feeding your Midnight Blue rose bush as soon as it’s established in the spring (about 3-4 weeks after planting, or as soon as you see new growth on an older plant). Feed it a couple more times during the growing season – once after the first blooms form and then a final time around midsummer.Water your rose bush before giving it fertilizer. Do not give fertilizer to a thirsty plant. Follow the dosage guidelines on the product packaging. Excess doses can damage the plant.You can opt to sprinkle a slow-release granule feed on top of the soil instead. The nutrients will be taken down to the roots the next few times you water the plant., Give container roses a feeding every 2-3 weeks through the spring and summer with a foliar feed or granule feed. Check the top inch of soil for moisture several times a week, and if it feels dry, saturate the soil with water. Ensure good drainage by putting the container up on feet.A layer of gravel at the bottom of the container can also help with drainage. If the rose outgrows the container it will need to be repotted into a larger one. Look for matted roots at the surface of the soil or roots growing out through the drainage holes.  Consider hand-pulling the weeds, as this is the gentlest and safest way to remove weeds without damaging your rose bush. You can also put mulch down around your plant to help stop weed growth.Try to avoid hoeing weeds around your roses, as rose roots tend to be close to the soil surface and can be damaged by the hoe. Avoid chemical weed killers as well, since these can also harm your rose bush.  Wait until the leaf buds begin to swell, then use a sturdy, sharp blade to ensure a clean cut. Prune by cutting at a 45-degree angle, just above a growth bud. Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow.Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems. If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about ⅓ of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less., Cut this back until you see a healthy white center to the stem. Your aim is to have a plant where growth is well spaced out to encourage the flow and circulation of air. Remove close growing stems and any that cross or are tangled.On older plants you can cut back any old wood growth that no longer produces any new stems.  In mild winter climates where shrub roses retain their leaves and bloom throughout most of the year, prune off all of the flowers and strip the leaves off the stems in January. When you do this, the shrub will be forced to take a brief rest and will grow fresh, new foliage and flowers in the spring., One criticism of the Midnight Blue Rose is that the flower heads don’t last very long. To promote the growth of more flowers, remove the spent flower heads regularly during the flowering season. 'Deadheading,’ as this is called, will encourage the plant to produce more flowers rather than put its energies into producing seed heads (also known as hips).Only cut the spent flower heads back to the first leaf in order to preserve as many leaves on the bush as possible.  Suckers are shoots produced from the plant’s roots. They appear from the ground and often have leaves that look different from the rest of the foliage: they may be paler in color or shaped differently. Trace any suckers back to the roots from which they grow and gently pull these away. If you just remove them at ground level they will regrow., Never leave any trimmed blooms, leaves, or stems on the ground around the bush. The debris can contribute to disease on your plant, so pick up all clippings and throw them away. Do not add them to compost since this could end up back in the soil around your rose bush., Blackspot is a fungal disease that causes leaf loss and stunts plant growth. Left untreated, it can kill a plant. While Midnight Blue rose bushes are typically resistant to blackspot, large amounts of rainfall could still trigger an attack. To treat blackspot, spray the tops and bottoms of all leaves with a fungicidal spray.Remove any leaves or parts of the plant that are infected with blackspot and throw them away. Pruning to promote air circulation, only watering in the morning, and keeping the area below the plant free of debris are a few ways to keep the leaves dry and free of blackspot.  A systemic spray will enter the plant’s system and prevent pests from being attracted to your rose bush. Use this once early in the growing season, just as leaves are beginning to form, then reapply every few weeks., Inspect your rose plant regularly for signs of aphids, scales and mealybugs, and spider mites. Aphids are tiny, soft-bodied insects that are commonly green or white and look like miniature moths. Scales and mealy bugs are small, flat or rounded insects that are usually immobile and look like tiny cotton balls.Spider mites are barely visible to the naked eye, but they cause tiny dots or stippling on the leaves and a fine web between the leaves or branches.  A mild infestation can usually be controlled by simply spraying them off with a strong stream of water from the garden hose in the morning a few times each week. However, if the pests become a serious problem, spray the rose in the early morning with insecticidal soap, being careful to coat the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as the stems.This type of soap is commonly sold in ready-to-use form and comes in a spray bottle at garden or home improvement stores. Spray the entire shrub and stems until the liquid is dripping from the leaves and running down the stems. Wait about an hour, then wash it off with a stream of water.	Pick out midnight blue roses that look healthy. Select a sunny spot. Choose a spot with well-draining soil. Soak bareroot rose bush roots overnight. Dig a hole that will accommodate the bush’s roots. Add manure to the soil before planting your roses. Place the bush in the hole and refill it with soil. Water the rose bush and the soil around it. Apply a layer of mulch to the area to help fight weeds. Water your rose bush when the soil around it becomes dry. Apply foliar feed to the leaves. Feed and water a container rose bush more regularly. Pull weeds that grow up around your rose bush. Prune your rose bush in the early spring. Remove any damaged or diseased growth. Prune in January if you live in an area with mild winters. Remove old flower heads to help the blooms last longer. Remove any suckers that appear. Rake up and dispose of any debris. Treat blackspot with fungicide. Prevent pests by using a systemic spray. Check your rose plant for pests regularly. Spray an infested shrub with insecticidal soap.
Whether your goal is to enhance the beauty of your home, or provide additional security, you have numerous lighting options to light up your home's exterior. Extend the hours you can spend outside, or create a festive environment!  , The selection of lighting fixtures is of two primary types: decorative and functional., The design of these fixtures should complement the look and feel of your house and landscape while providing sufficient lighting for safety, security, and functionality.   When installing a wall lantern, size the fixture to the door and surrounding space. Wall lanterns should be mounted slightly above eye level at about 60" to 66" from the center of the fixture to the floor. Post-top lanterns can be selected to match the style of the wall lanterns. Large post top lanterns make a better impression when used in large open space.  They spill light in all directions and can be a cause of light trespass (onto others' properties) and distracting glare for drivers. Many lighting designers forgo lantern style lights entirely and instead use lights with hoods (that shield the glare) and lights that are positioned within plant material so they are hidden completely.  They are strategically positioned around the property to selectively illuminate plant material and architecture. A skilled lighting designer positions fixtures so only the effect of the illumination is seen, not the lighting fixtures themselves.  Add landscape lighting, deck lighting, and step lighting to not only bring out the beauty of the home at night, but also add extra security and safety.	Use functional and fun lighting outside. Consider the types of lighting available. Use decorative fixtures are used along pathways, on walls and posts, and entrance foyers. Be mindful, however, that most lantern-style fixtures are glaring light sources. Use hidden lights for functional purposes. Include some lighting for security, too.
Like many vegetables, there are innumerable varieties of radishes at your disposal, both hybrid and open-pollinated. If you are a novice gardener, consider growing Cherry Belle radishes; they mature in just 22 days and have a pleasant, mild flavor.Spring radishes are the types that people are most familiar (like the Cherry Belle radish, which is the the red on the outside, white on the inside one). You want to make sure that you're growing these in spring or fall. They tend to be the fastest growing radish, as well. Typically the summer radish is similar to the spring radish, but tends to grow more slowly, taking around 6-8 weeks to mature. The winter radish is much larger and starchier than the spring and summer radishes and takes longer to grow. It's best to sow it in late summer for a fall or winter harvest. Winter radishes include Daikon and Champions. Daikon can grow to 18 inches (45 cm) long and takes 60 days to mature, and includes some extra-spicy varieties.; , Radishes should be planted in an area with full sun or partial shade, and loose, well-drained soil. Remove any rocks from the soil, as the roots will bifurcate around any rocks in their way. Add organic matter to the soil before planting, such as compost, manure, or leaf mold.Make sure your radishes are getting plenty of sunlight. Otherwise they will grow big on top and very small in the root section. However, too much sunlight can cause radishes to go to seed. The soil needs to be free of rocks, well-drained and have a pH content between 5.8 and 6.8. Use plenty of organic matter (like compost) in the soil. For best results, conduct a soil test or send soil samples to a lab to check for proper nutrients. Make any adjustments to the soil at least one week before planting.  Radishes are a cool weather crop best planted in spring and autumn. Growing radishes during the hot summer months may cause them to bolt. You can plant your first crop a full 2 weeks before the last frost in spring, as radishes endure frost well.Stop growing when hot weather shows up. This basically means that if you're having consecutive days of 60 °F (16 °C) or above you should hold off on your radish planting until it gets cooler. A typical spring radish germinates in about 5 days, and is ready for harvest in 3 to 4 weeks. Because radishes grow so quickly, you can "inter-crop" them between slow-growing vegetables to make row markers. You can also "succession plant" them by sowing a new row each week, to spread your harvest over a longer period.  You will want them to be about 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) deep and 1 inch (25 mm) apart. As they germinate, thin the successful seedlings to about 2 inches (5 cm) apart, allowing more space for bigger varieties. Rows should be planted about 1 foot (30 cm) apart.You will want to thin the radishes when they have grown about 1 inch. Aim to just cut off their heads with a small pair of scissors, all the way down to the soil.If you're planting a large radish you will want to plant the seeds about 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch deep. Radishes work well as companion plants, because they keep a lot of the bugs off the regular plants and they grow more quickly. Plant them alongside carrots, parsnips, and cabbages.  Keep the radish beds moist, but not soaked. Watering radishes frequently and evenly will result in quick growth; if radishes grow too slowly, they will develop a hot, woody taste. Add compost to the radish bed as desired to help retain moisture.   If you don't water them evenly (for example, not watering for a few days and then drowning them) the radishes can crack.  Radishes are typically ready to harvest when their roots are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Check your seed packet for your variety's expected size at harvest and time to maturity. To harvest, lift the entire plant out of the ground with your hand.You can also push back the dirt and see if a bulb has grown. If so, pull a few radishes and taste them. That will let you know if they're ready to be harvested. Unlike many root vegetables, radishes cannot be left in the ground, as doing so will cause them to become tough and pithy.  Brush the soil off your radishes using your hand, and then store them in a cool, dark place for up to 2 weeks. Wash them with water before eating them., There are different kinds of fungi that can kill your radish or make it taste really bad. Usually there are obvious signs of a fungus problem that you can watch out for and subsequently deal with.If pale yellow and grey spots appear on the radish leaves, your radish might have leaf spot, also known as Septoria leaf spot, a fungal disease. If you do have this, make sure that your planting bed is well-drained (the water doesn't just sit there) and add organic matter (like compost). Remove the infected radishes. To avoid this problem, rotate your crops so that you don't plant your radishes in the same bed each time. Also, keep your garden free of plant debris (dead plants, weeds you've picked, etc.). If pale green spots start appearing on the upper side of the leaves, with a purple downy growth on the undersides, you might be dealing with downy mildew, a type of fungus. Get rid of infected plants and make sure that you aren't over-watering. Avoiding radish over-crowding by thinning the herd. To avoid downy mildew, make sure that you rotate your crops, and keep the garden free of plant debris. If the radish leaves turn yellow between their veins, if the leaf margins turn brown and curl upward, if the stem base turns dark brown, black, and becomes slimy, you might have blackleg, a fungal disease. Add organic matter, like compost, to the plant bed, and make sure that your soil is well drained (not holding too much water and that you aren't over-watering). To avoid getting this, make sure that you rotate your crops.  Fungi aren't the only things that can cause problems with your radishes. Certain bugs can get into your plants and feed on them so that they begin to die. Many times you can avoid these bugs by keeping your garden clear of plant debris and weeds. If they do show up there are some ways you can deal with them.   If your leaves are looking faded and you find that there are tunnels and grooves in the roots, you might have root maggots. These tiny critters are small, gray/white, legless worms. Flies lay their eggs in the soil beside the plant. To get rid of them, add lime or wood ashes to the base of your radish plants. Wait to plant your radishes until the weather is drier so that you avoid the maggot's life cycle. If you have tiny holes appearing in the radish leaves, you might have flea beetles. These little critters are bronze or black beetles 1/16th of an inch long. If you find you have these, spread diatomaceous earth, a type of soft, sedimentary rock that crumbles easily into a fine, off-white powder. This can act as a natural bug killer.You should also cultivate the ground often, so that you disrupt the beetles' life cycle. If your radish plants have whitish or yellowish spots, have deformed leaves, or if the plants are wilting, you might have Harlequin bugs. These bugs, which are black with yellow or red or orange markings, suck the fluids out of the radish's plant tissue. Pick out and destroy all the bugs and the egg masses. To help keep them out of your garden, keep it clear of the places where bugs breed, like crop residue and weeds. If the leaves of your radish plant turn a dull yellow, if they curl and become brittle, your radish plant might have contracted Aster yellows, a mycoplasma disease spread by Leafhoppers. If this is the case, remove the infected plant or plants, and control the leaf-hopper population by keeping down the weeds and plant debris.  Soil temperature, type, and how watered it is can play a big role in how well your radish plant is doing. Remember that you're trying for evenly watered (not overly watered), correct pH content soil.   If your radishes end up tasting too hot or too pungent, it likely means that the soil is too dry or the temperature of the soil is too hot (above 90 degrees Fahrenheit). To protect your roots and cool the soil, add 2 to 3 inches of organic mulch. Water your radishes 2 to 3 hours at a time and then wait until the soil has dried to at least a 4 inch depth. If the radish root is pithy and woody the temperature of the soil has likely been too high and the watering spotty. Make sure that the roots are covered with soil or warmth to keep them cool and that you are watering evenly. Also, make sure that you are harvesting your radishes as soon as they're big enough, so that they don't grow too big and crack.	Decide what variety of radishes you want to plant. Pick the right site for growing. Schedule your radish plantings. Sow the radish seeds. Water the radishes as they grow. Harvest the radishes. Clean and store your radishes. Deal with fungi problems. Get rid of problematic bugs. Check your soil.
Here are some ideas:   Chopsticks Knitting needle (blunt end) Screwdriver (blunt end); , Wrap the end of a pencil in adhesive tape, sticky side facing out.  This is a great tool because the stuffing sticks to the tape, enabling it to be carried easily into the far corners of the toy or doll. Push the stuffing into the corners of the toy using the end of the tool and pulling back out when the stuffing is in place.  If you need to replace the tape for a larger soft toy, do so as the need becomes obvious.	Use what you have lying around. Make the tool. Use it. Repeat until all the stuffing is in place.
The most important item to buy is either canvas or burlap measuring 2 1/2 feet by 4 1/2 feet. This can be found at most craft stores. You can choose any color of canvas or burlap you like, but remember that you will be painting designs on top of the material. Therefore, you should go for lighter colors, such as white or off-white.You will also need to pick up the following items: painter's tape, fabric paint, a paper plate, a small paintbrush, a template with your design of choice, sandpaper, an iron, fabric glue, two 7/8-inch dowels, two eye hooks, and twine to hang your tapestry.  Measure, with a ruler, 3 inches from the bottom of the canvas and draw a straight horizontal line. Take a piece of masking tape that is 2 1/2 feet long and place it along this line (top edge of masking tape goes on the line).Measure 1 inch above the masking tape, and draw another straight, horizontal line. Place a 2 1/2 foot long piece of masking tape along this line (bottom edge of masking tape goes along line).  Place a small amount of fabric paint on a paper plate. Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and paint between the two pieces of tape. While you can slightly paint over the tape, make sure not to get loose paint on the rest of the canvas. It is best to dab rather than to brush in long strokes.Wipe your paintbrush off with a paper towel, and then run it under some hot water. This will get the excess paint off. Wait for the paint to dry before you safely remove the tape strips. You can add more paint stripes above the one you made. Simply repeat the previous instructions, adjusting the height of each of your stripes (instead of a 1 inch stripe, you may want to paint a 1/2 inch stripe above the one you already painted). Leave some space in between each stripe so that you can clearly see each one. Make sure not to make too many stripes, as you need some space to paint on your design.  You will want to stick to something basic that can be identified simply by the outline of the object or thing. Many simple designs can be found online, such as animals, flowers, architecture, etc. Whatever picture you choose, print it out, and cut it out using scissors.You can adjust the picture size when you print it out to fit your canvas. You will want it no larger than 2 1/2 feet in vertical length, and 2 feet in horizontal width. When you have cut out your design, center it on the canvas. Use a ruler to make sure that it is equidistant on the horizontal sides and vertical sides respectively. Trace around the design with a light pencil mark, and remove the design.  Spread a small amount of fabric paint onto a clean paper plate. Dip into the paint with your small paintbrush, and use dabbing motions on the fabric. You can choose to use multiple colors for your design, or just one. You can also add small amounts of black or white paint to create some shading.Try to keep the paint color true to the original design. For instance, if you do a piece of architecture, use brown paint if its wooden, or grey paint if it is stone. Once you are done painting the design, set your canvas aside to give it time to dry. Meanwhile, you can rub off the excess paint on your paintbrush with paper towel, and then run the paintbrush under some hot water.  Note: this is a strictly optional step. When your canvas is nearly dried, you can scrunch up with fabric in order to give your painting a more worn, and antiquated look. Fold it like an accordion, and immediately relieve the stress. You can also run sandpaper over the design gently. This will peel off some of the paint and create a weathered look.If you choose to do this step, you will need to iron the surrounding canvas. Iron the blank canvas around the design, using the low setting on your iron. Make sure to do this on an ironing board, or another safe surface. Ironing the excess fabric will create a nice contrast between the antiquated design, and the smooth, soft canvas. Once you are done ironing, let your canvas rest in a safe place so that it stays wrinkle-free.  These loops will be used to hold your dowel rods. Once your design is completely dry, flip your canvas over. Take the top part of the canvas and curl it backwards, so that you have one inch of fabric on the back. You can crease it if you like in order to keep it from constantly curling back.Place a small amount of fabric glue on the edge of the pulled back fabric. Make sure to leave some space underneath for your dowel rod to slide through. Press the edge down onto the backside of the canvas and apply pressure until it is dry. Do the same at the bottom of your canvas. Pull backwards an inch of fabric and fold it by making a crease. Place some fabric glue on the edge of the folded fabric (leaving space underneath) and apply pressure until it is dry. If you do not have the patience for typical fabric glue, you can use hot glue for a faster drying period. However, make sure that you are using safe practices, not getting any of the hot glue on your hands.  One dowel rod for each of the two loops you just created. Screw an eye hook onto each end of the top dowel (eye hooks are basically screws with hoops on the end). You should be able to screw them in by hand, although you may need to pre-drill a tiny hole in order to help expedite the process.Thread one strand of twine through both of the eye hooks. Leave some lagging twine in between so that you can hang your canvas. Tie a knot on each end of the twine, near the eye hooks. Once you are done, hang the tapestry design on your wall.	Gather your materials. Lay your canvas out vertically. Paint your canvas. Print out your template. Paint inside of your design. Add texture and life to your painting. Create loops at the top and bottom of your canvas. Slide your dowel rods through the loops.
For the optimum security, your home needs to be outfitted with strong deadbolts and door locks to keep your stuff and your family safe. You can do this yourself, as door locks are easy and inexpensive to replace. Once you do, always lock them and instruct your family to always lock them.   It's possible that older residents likely have kept a copy of your key, so it's good to change the locks if you've just moved in, to help prevent theft.; , Having an alarm reduces the likelihood of a break-in, and makes the effects of a break-in much more minor. You can engage the alarm when you're away, as well as setting it to night or stay mode, for your own safety while you're in for the night. Invest in a system that will alert the police (or fire station) immediately and your home phone should receive a call from them asking if everything is all right.   Shop around for the best monthly monitoring prices. The brands you probably know from television cost four times per month more than other companies that are probably local to you. Knowing the pricing of other companies will help you negotiate a lower rate. Be sure to use the alarm each time you go out, and change the code every year or two, using something hard to guess but easy to remember for the code. If the alarm company offers signs for windows or lawn, use them. The whole idea is to make your home less attractive for an easy theft.  You can help prevent theft at your home by putting a clear thick window film on your ground floor and basement windows to keep them from breaking-in. There are clear, frosted and reflective (mirrored) films, depending on your privacy needs. This is commonly used in earthquake country to prevent shattering, and is also useful to resist a break-and-enter type of theft.  Help your neighborhood by getting to know the cars and habits of your neighbors. This may seem like a little thing, but thieves really do target places where they think they are blending in or not noticed. Once they know someone is very aware of them, they will feel uncomfortable and will quickly move on. As you probably can't be home all the time, this works best if you can encourage your neighbors to do the same.   If you see someone strange or a strange vehicle near your house, go out and offer to help them with directions (pretend to think that they are lost) or otherwise engage them "how are you, how is your day." Be polite and never challenge them ("what are you doing here") as a confrontation could be a risk to safety. A thief will talk as little as possible and then move on to the next neighborhood.  If they arrive at your door, go outside to talk with them, locking your door behind. Many thieves use some excuse to come into the home to get some idea of what to steal. Going outside will help deter them. If they ask, politely say no.   If they claim to be from your town government, ask to see ID first and take their picture using your mobile phone. A real government official won't be upset by this and may even congratulate you on being safe. Always document strangers who come around or seem suspicious in some way. Take a quick picture just to have it in case something happens in the future.  Dogs, even small dogs and docile animals, can help to deter theft. Thieves don't want to mess with potential dog-alarms and bites. If you're concerned about security at your home, consider investing in a family pet who will have the added benefit of barking its head off any time someone comes around with ill intent. This can help you feel safe and provide you with an added layer of security.  Be sure to put away bicycles, radios or anything of value away when you're not using them or done for the day to reduce their visibility to the passerby. Expensive tools, shoes and other things should never be left out where they could be easily taken.  Never leave coins, paper money, wallets, radios, mobile phones or computers visible through the windows of your car. Take them inside and store them properly. This can encourage vehicle theft, and possibly more.  There's no need to broadcast that you've got a big plasma screen television inside and a new Macbook sitting on your desk. Thieves will be much less interested in gambling with what you've got inside if they can't see it. There's no sense in drawing attention to what you've got.  If you are one of the lucky ones with a garage and you keep anything like tools, bicycle or expensive vehicles in it, keep it closed most of the time to prevent anyone passing by taking mental inventory of what you have as incentive to possibly break in later.  Increase night visibility around your home by employing outdoor lighting. Modern LEDs are waterproof and use much less wattage than conventional outdoor lighting.  Consider removing any bushes that are growing against the home providing hiding spots. If you have a fence, keep the gates closed and put up no trespassing signs, which suggests to thieves that you're taking security seriously.  Don't publish personal information such as your telephone number, address, and detailed lists of things you own and your daily activity. If you let everyone know you're out of the town for three days, your new stereo could become an attractive theft option.   If you post a picture in the place you live, be careful not to let the GPS turned on, so everybody will find out where you live.	Change your home's exterior door locks. Consider getting an alarm system installed. Have anti-shatter plastic installed on your windows. Keep an eye out for your neighbors. Never invite strangers into your home. Get a dog. Keep things inside. Take things out of your car. Keep your blinds closed. Keep your garage door closed. Keep your home well-lit. Eliminate hiding spots around your home. Be careful on the Internet.
As the camera panned the audience who was cheering happily, the announcer for the show would scream into the camera "All these people want to know" then the theme music sung by the a capella group would chime in with their music of "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" as the show's logo entered the picture. After this, the scene would segue into the greeting of players. During the first three seasons the players would be standing in the hallway prior to the main entry area of the stage where the show would be taped - some reading the newspaper, some using the phone, others just standing around waiting - though this was only how they were cast. During the fourth and fifth season of the show, players entered from the "Chief's" room door directly onto the stage.; , Based upon the results of a National Geographic survey that indicated that Americans didn't know enough about their geography, this show was presented to alarmingly see just how much children knew and understood about geography in a series of questions which resulted in the capture of a crook and the master hench-woman herself, Carmen Sandiego. (You'll see game play information below.), Each of these contestants would be called "gumshoes" because they would be spying for clues and trying to solve a mystery of which henchman took a piece of a location. Each gumshoe was informed of who took the loot and sometimes even tried to discuss the crook's reason for stealing such a priceless item. During season 2 only, the viewer would see new graphics be presented where a file cabinet's drawer would open and discuss the crook, but the ultimate knowledge that players needed to know wasn't really what was in the drawer but what clues were given otherwise., Round one was rather easy. Through a variety of sketches and clues, players would take guesses at trying to track down the episode's crook. The three contestants would be awarded a free 50 points to begin the game.  Research on the Lightning Round to the show. Questions relating to the locations of where the loot was stolen from was called the Lightning round. Unlike what you'd find in rounds that go faster with a name similar to "lightning", this didn't involve fast questions. Starting with season 3, the stage would flash with "lightning effects" but without loosing the power. If the player buzzing in answered it correctly, they would be awarded 5 crime bucks. If they didn't answer or buzzed in and were incorrect, they wouldn't loose any points but wouldn't gain these extra points. Watch the comedy breaks in the show. The Chief would call the host (described later) into her office. Normally this would be a comedy break in the show after a period of 5 or so airtime minutes, during which both would mention the ultimate prize of winning the show - an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in the continental United States (during season 1) or an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in North America (seasons 2 and 3). Most of the way through season 3, they introduced a new bit. Viewers could enter a contest - after writing down what was stolen and from where over the course of 4 episodes, the viewers could send in this information in an envelope (you got-to remember, this was a time before the Internet was well-known) and would be entered into a contest - some people won these contests as was displayed on screen. (Each winning contest winner would receive a Carmen Sandiego T-shirt). Watch the Training exercise that began after the host met with the Chief (who was the announcer who'll you meet with later in this article). Training exercises began after the Chief's sketch. The gumshoes each opened one of three trash cans to grab a card. On it had a flag of the country in which the crook was hiding out, along with questions relating to the clue that the host had to answer. Such things included "language of the location" or "major religion" or one of many others. Play later moved inside to try and find out this location. Players who buzzed in and answered correctly would win 10 crime point/bucks. Players who didn't wouldn't loose any points, but wouldn't gain any either. This clue game only began in the 5th and final season of the show - something that wasn't very developed when the show ended. Understand the Phone Tap. All of a sudden, the host would talk to the gumshoes that ACME intercepted a call between Carmen and the crook that would lead to clues of where the crook was hiding yet again. These phone taps would always happen. If the player guessed in correctly, they'd win 10 Crime buck points. If incorrect, they wouldn't loose anything. Research the Chase round. The Chase was a rather weird round. Following a sketch that had several of Rockapella's members chasing each other one in back of the other (as a comedy to introduce the segment, though this comedy sketch only began starting with season 3), players would try to track the crook through various locations on one of several maps. From the location according to that received during the phone tap, players would guess this country, mountain or (in later seasons outside of season 1 and 2) river and, if correct receive 5 crime buck points. If they didn't answer correctly, they wouldn't be penalized.  Final clue destination question: At first, the host would ask the players to wager points out of their available points - anywhere between 0 and 50 only in increments of 10 - of which they'd have cards to denote each. Rockapella would sing a classic tune that all viewers knew by the end of the series though most would be not typeable here since it had a hint of incorrectly understood lyrics (until you checked the closed captioning) on the show. The gumshoes would try to wager based on their knowledge of the map on the TV screen they had in front of them. Clues would be given, then one last question was asked. The players would try and answer the question. If they were right, they'd gain their points they wagered. However, unlike other clue answers, if they guessed incorrectly, they'd loose these points. Wagering worked best when you lots of knowledge towards each of the areas on the map board - sometimes this would be the United States or North America. The top two-scoring teams passed into Round 2. The third gumshoe left the episode with some departing gifts that more often that not contained a electronic address book tool (that was the envy of every kid before the Internet, PDAs and iPhones were well-known).   During season 1, before the gumshoes and host left for the location obtained in the very last question, the host would segue into a Photo Recon session then leave for the location's room that was used for round 2, carrying suitcases as if they really traveled from one place to another. However, past season 1, things got a little hairy. Photo Recon happened after they arrived in the new location starting with season 2, and in season 3 there was even a skit where monochrome videos were shown and you'd hear voiceovers of the Chief and the host bickering over how they were getting to their destination. In Season 5, they changed the walk into something a little more "virtual" and they were beamed up (and later beamed down) after holding their breaths into an showerhead-like external modem that came down from the ceiling. They grabbed bags as they walked out the door. Photo Recon was ever rarely anything useful for the next round but to explain the place to the gumshoe player and what was up on their board to choose from and to more inform the player of what that location had to hold.  Sometimes called the Photo Recon round in a special room that looked like a train station, Round 2 generally started with Photo Recon starting with the second season after the host placed a special "card" or other object that was supposed to visually transition over to the chief into the machine-board. The boards contained a total of fifteen landmark locations from which the gumshoes had to find three items. To complete the board, they had to find the loot from the days show, then the Warrant then the crook (and only in that order). If they found any of these special tiles, they would be able to choose another tile. This round was much like the game of Memory that you might have played as a kid. If they found tiles that had footmarks on them; these were bad and they'd lose their turn and turn would be passed to the next player of the two. Generally, when a player found either the loot, warrant or crook, their house band Rockapella would sing what they found - and even starting with season 2 would change what they'd found into things a little more comical. Until all three have been found. Season 3 added Rockapella singing that the team had found a dud when they located the footprint tile. Sometimes, the crook had a special "send-off" - (Patty Larceny would be sung "P-P-P-Patty", but there were other notable variations once you've seen each type in action a few times.  The only time when the gumshoe ended up choosing this order first, without seeing other tiles, the gumshoe Ali Haider was at the board. On his very first pick which was the very first player of the round, he chose all three of the correct tiles in the correct order. Was this just a fluke, or was he briefed beforehand off-screen? He was later asked to find a $100 savings bond hidden within the remaining tiles where the footsteps tiles would have appeared - (spoiler for remainder of the sentence) he later missed finding this tile but was found just below one of the tiles he picked. You can find this episode online in the case called The Gateway Getaway (episode 6 of season 1) if you look on YouTube.  The gumshoe then walked over and put the crook away. There was a metal rope (with a green handle loop at the bottom edge) that the gumshoe would pull down a fair distance which would trigger the graphics of the program which would put the crook behind bars and out of sight.  Shortly thereafter, the departing player would be told what they'd depart with as per gifts. Most often times, this included a year's subscription of National Geographic World and/or a communicator like the one handed to the departing contestant from round 1.  The winning gumshoe then was asked to write down where they'd like to go if they won the grand prize which was an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in the continental United States (season 1) or North America (seasons 2-5) in a portfolio styled notebook. This segment would generally be oversung by Rockapella's classic song that began 'Where do you wanna' go? Yeah, yeah!" then concluded with misunderstood audible words to their same song. This segment would generally last about 60 seconds - therefore, the answers would generally be written down quickly and there would be no artistic works inside the portfolio., The crook would then call the set that would be received in the telephone box on the wall. The crook would tell the player where they last knew Carmen would be. During season 1 this could have included the United States, South America, Europe, Asia, or Africa. During season 2-5, United States expanded to North America. After a classic host moment of the Chief saying "Greg" and the host saying "Let's go to the map", they'd run across to the set the final challenge would be set up, and where if completed correctly the gumshoe would capture Carmen Sandiego. This is the last time the viewer hears about the Crook who stole the loot., After the introduction, the player and host would run over to the final challenge of the game which was a huge map on the floor that was a political map to a continent with several circular placemarks on it. There was a huge map of the continent or United States (season 1)/North America (all others) placed on the ground where along with several dots on it. During season 3-5, there'd be additional arrows that indicated bodies of water. The gumshoe had 45 seconds (60 seconds if the map was Asia) to locate the 7 items that the host would read off. Each item was read off and they used blue-light special like markers to mark the location of the item on the map. If they got their answer right, great! If they got it wrong, they could move it one time. If they got it wrong on the second attempt, they were asked to leave the marker where it was - few understood that and many picked up the marker to move it - but didn't get too far following that., While some players won this round and captured Carmen (and in turn the newspaper clipping would show Carmen being put behind bars of a jail cell), many times the player missed her and she'd escape (no bars would be seen and she'd be in the newspaper clipping looking for the next thing to steal in her side profile way). A newspaper listing would come up on screen if she escaped capture, and by the 4th season her logo in the newspaper would inevitably disappear (in other seasons preceding the 4th, her face profile logo would stay on the page. If the player was able to make it, the portfolio would be tossed to the host who'd reveal the prize vacation the player won. For those who didn't make it for the grand prize, their portfolio was never shown, and all they won was the generic prize package instead., During round 1, each player had to grab a cardboard sign from in front of them. Upon verbally answering, they'd have to hold up their sign that stated what they were verbally going to say in front of their chest until all players have answered or the answer had been mentioned. (As you'll learn later, for the episode containing guest stars along with the gumshoes to help them out, only one teammate had to hold the sign while the guest-star verbally answered the choice.) During the Photo Recon round, players stood in front of a board containing many Memory-like pieces that turned and players gave their response verbally. In the Map Round, players ran around a giant board with several "blue light special"-type lightpoles that strobe-light-flashed a red light when placed at the right location to mark their answers., As players finished the final map puzzle or had run out of time, they'd look at where the player was going (if they lost or didn't finish the map correctly, they didn't look at what their choice was.) then the host handed over the duties of telling the player what they won to the announcer/the Chief who'd say that they won several things (but this varied) and also their status with ACME changed from "gumshoe" to sleuth. Then, the scene would segue one more time; the host would remind the player what their last job was for the show (apparently being briefed before the show on this). Both the host and the player would say "Do it, Rockapella" as they cheered with throwing their left arm into the air. During the credits (of seasons 2-5), the audience was allowed to come up on top of the map to dance and sing with the theme song. However, for season 1, the audience wasn't that lucky. The Chief would always state "This is Lynne Thigpen speaking for Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, and remember, and she'd continue with something rhythmically comical of prose.  Sometimes during the first season, the Chief would call a contestant into her office. She'd ask the member to answer a single geography question. Whether or not they got this right, they were asked to return as a contestant for the following season. If they got it right, they were given a Carmen Sandiego sweatshirt, but if they got it wrong, would be given a National Geographic World Atlas instead. According to the written statements at the end of the credits, all gumshoes were briefed before the show as to the rules, but was stated that this was the case by the end of the show. Also, none of the season 1 episodes ever returned in repeats. In 1991, the Soviet Union breakup happened during the off-season and PBS didn't want inaccurate information floating around to the outside world after the breakup. Lastly, there was a verbal statement that ended up being spoken that said "All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded." However, during the second season, this wasn't mentioned except in text on the screen during the credits.  During the question rounds at the beginning, players would be shown their question and a map of the area on an older-style TV set. During the first season, the TV would be turned on by the host, but this segue would later be discontinued and ended up coming on and staying on without needing to be turned on by the host following the first season., Greg Lee was this show's host, and although this was his only real TV game show he was really appointed host of, he really got into his work and enjoyed the challenge of hosting this show. The onstage title he was given was that of "ACME's Special Agent in Charge of Training New Recruits" (later changed from the third season onwards to Senior Agent in Charge of Training New Recruits". Greg would generally enter the show with a blue suit jacket and a tie with a white dress shirt underneath it. He'd generally open the stage door to enter the staging area at the beginning of each and every episode. He would later leave the set prior to the Jailtime Challenge round when the players would need to be promoted to the next round, grabbing his hat in between. (During season 5, Greg would leave this stage using a digital graphic of the players and him disappearing through a modem connection beaming them up and dropping them where they needed to go, but this looked awful to the viewer and was one of the causes of the demise of this program., Double Trouble were a pair of almost-conjoined twins who almost always mirror each other in their monochrome skin colors. Eartha Brute is a muscle-heavy workaholic. She even exemplifies that of a workaholic when she wears her pink singlet uniform and VILE initialed-weight belt. Kneemoi is an round alien from another planet out of our galaxy. Although this villain is pretty much a pink ball of ectoplasm, this villain can change herself into any form and color she desires. Patty Larceny is a blonde-haired schoolgirl who has an beyond just-giggly attitude but who has just a kindle and polite manner under her skin without letting her attitude show. RoboCrook is a robot spoof who appeared to be the crook beginning in an episode in the third season. It was originally mentioned that his real name was "RoboCrook Unit 059" but those additional details were rarely mentioned and he was never called this full name when he was the crook for the show. Sarah Nade is a punk-rock teenager with a rainbow colored hairdo. Top Grunge is a muscle-builder, smelly motorcyclist. He always has flies hanging over him. He rides a motorcycle that is definitely not finely-tuned: it always has smoke coming out the back. But the viewer never sees this biker without his large sunglasses which always stand-out from the normal appearance of your traditional biker. Vic the Slick is of the salesman variety who always comes dressed in a polyester suit and tie, as well as shifty eyes and well-combed black hair. Most often times, Vic would hit on Carmen calling her "sweetheart" and "doll face". Apparently, he had this special love for the titular character, Carmen Sandiego, though he knew he would never catch up with her in the end. Wonder Rat is a superhero parody who wears a rat costume who is strapped via a bungee cord to a flying helicopter. Carmen Sandiego was the ultimate crook who was the ultimate person who each gumshoe player had to "catch" at the end of the show. She'd generally wear a red down-coat, along with a red long-brimmed South-American-like hat and black slim gloves on her hands. We rarely saw her lower extremities, so what she wore there still remains a mystery. The viewers ultimate goal of each show was to watch the gumshoe catch her after successfully completing the World Map, and jailing the crook after the Jailhouse Challenge round. She'd be the instigator of the group of crooks and would always speak to the gang in several portions of the episode including the Phone Tap in the middle of the Questions/Clues round.  While this was described in the Question round with players standing at a podium with a long desk, a TV screen for the Host, and window and several clippings up on the walls with the host in the Question round room, you could also see a door that led to a hallway. Another door to the left of the contestants (from the viewpoint of the viewer) led to the chief's office. The Chief's office looked like the office of a spy and a desk filled with paperwork was shown along with file cabinets and papers galore, several books on a bookshelf (that included information on the crooks that were in place during each seasons' episodes) and various other knick-kacks. Past this, you could never see any other round's info until the round came up. During the Photo Recon, the set looked like a train station followed by a board that had several turn-around spots. Players stood in back of a solid set of a line - the board was set up a little higher than normal on a slight pedestal that only was emphasized for the board alone. During the Map scene, you could often see the audience situated around the edges to the Map room (though Seldom you could see the final Map from the introductory sequence). As was described before, this Map changed from show to show so this set looked different almost every single time. (As you'll see later, things looked quite different when a spin-off of this show occurred and had looked more like the inside of a Star-Trek like space ship/time traveling device and rooms with Portals that will be described later.), The player's costume's never changed. Each player would wear a red sleeveless vest, along with a yellow dress shirt. They would wear this same costume throughout the entire show and never had to change it until the episode was over. The shirts the players would have on would contain a neck piece that would be folded down, and on the vest would be the "ACME Crimenet" logo on the right side, and their yellow, square nametag would be on their left., Rockapella was a common stage band that performed at this show, and who still performs to this day. They acted to introduce the Chase round, and sung several things, helped with singing clues when the clue needed to be sung (this didn't happen too often) and they even helped out with other unsung clues in the hallway. They helped sing the reprised version at the end of the show, and could even be spotted during the balcony(season 1 only) and hallway seasons(following seasons) and at other times. They were an integral portion of the well-used cast who performed their jobs rather well. There were 4 members of this house band when this band performed in the show., Although there were times when special episodes occurred, most often times episodes would air as if the people on it were just normal contestants. In one episode in the fifth season, Greg Lee and Marc Summers (host of the popular Nickelodeon kids game show called Double Dare and it's more current inclusionary programs called Super Sloppy Double Dare and Family Double Dare) co-hosted together for a few moments and even introduced the clue together for a question. On another episode during the second season(first episode of the second season), celebrity guests helped the players out - including a special reminder for viewers to watch their show they were a part of during the phone conversation after the Jailtime Challenge round prior to having the villain tell them where Carmen would be sending them to complete her challenge - the only time guest stars would help the gumshoe players out., Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego aired for five seasons generally at the 5pm ET slot daily every weekday of each week but only from September to December on the viewer's public broadcasting networks such as PBS under the discretion of several sponsors and the support of "viewers like you". It was produced by WQED Pittsburgh and WGBH Boston. It generally aired without advertisements in a 30 minute time slot and would never rerun an episode twice (all episodes were "fresh out of the box"). It had 5 seasons on air and it aired 295 episodes during this time span.Season 1 aired every weekday between September 30, 1991 and December 27,1991 airing 65 episodes.Season 2 aired every weekday between September 28, 1992 and December 25, 1992 airing 65 episodes.Season 3 aired every weekday between September 27, 1993 and December 24, 1993 airing 65 episodes.Season 4 aired every weekday between October 10, 1994 and December 23, 1994 airing 50 episodes.Season 5 aired every weekday between October 9, 1995 and December 22,1995 airing 50 episodes.There was an episode that never aired but apparently was an un-aired pilot episode that was titled "Auld Lang Gone" where the contestants were tracking Patty Larceny and the person captured Carmen San Diego as well through the Map of Europe., The announcer for the show had a varied responsibility. Although she was known more often as just "The Chief", she partook to mocking fun at the tough role her Chief responsibility took her, and even starting with the third and fourth season helped transition the group (with the help of Greg in her office - another common response during most episodes) to helping to show past winners of the weekly game where viewers would collect information from four shows (including what was stolen and from where and then mailed those in to the show). This person's name was Lynne Thigpen who went on to have other jobs in the entertainment industry including more major major-character roles out in the workforce., When this show went off the air after the 1995 season due to it's decreasing popularity, another show picked up where this show left off. And while Thigpen (explained earlier) reprised her role, things changed. The show that aired was called "Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego" and even that show didn't last all that long either - basing the clues on time periods instead of world's popular places and things. It included new villains and changed the host, included a famous robot motor that would transport it's players through time (called the "Chronoskimmer") and introduced a 3-person crew that would operate it's motor. On this show during the bonus run, players would enter time portals and exit through to catch Carmen. However, it only ran 2 seasons.	Recognize how each episode began.

You can either use face paint or makeup. Put a base paint of yellow all over your face. This is the iconic foundation for the Cheshire Cat from the 1951 cartoon.  Sponge purple around the outside of your face so that the the yellow fades in. You can use a house sponge if you do not own any makeup accessories. Be sure to cover all the areas that are on the outside of your face like: the top of your forehead, neck, ears, etc., Dab your cheeks with white to lighten your cheeks. It might help you to look at a picture of the Cheshire Cat and apply the paint in relation to the image.  Use yellow or white eyeliner along your waterline. Draw whiskers in black around your nose. Color in your nose with black face paint. You can use black eyeliner for the whiskers., You don’t have to create a mouth out of make up over your mouth, but instead could wear purple lipstick. There are a few ways you can create the smiling mouth out of makeup. Depending on your makeup skills, you can make the classic smiling face, or create a scarier face with sharper teeth.For the classic smile: use white makeup to create a wide smiling face around your mouth. Imagine a crescent moon when designing the smile. Once the white has dried, use a fine tipped brush or eyeliner to create teeth. The classic smile, from the cartoon, only has one row of teeth. The Tim Burton smile is much creepier because the teeth are rigged and fang like. To create this look, you’ll need to create a crescent smile using black paint. Once the black has dried, create small teeth in the shape of triangles, or in the shape of shark’s teeth. Create two rows of teeth: one row going down from the top and the other going up from the bottom of the mouth.	Apply the base layer. Apply a layer of purple. Lighten your cheeks. Add additional details. Create the Cheshire’s smile.
You may need to give it a good scrubbing if the label leaves debris behind.   Make sure you allow ample dry time for the wine bottle before proceeding to the next steps.; , You will want to drill a hole large enough to string lights through. Don’t forget the protective gear before drilling/cutting the hole.   The hole will be located on the backside of the bottle so take that into consideration before making the cut.  You can either apply glue directly to the bottle or add marbles or to the marbles and place on the glass.   Pack the marbles tightly on the bottle so you can barely see the glass bottle.       Allow marbles to dry before moving to the next step.  Holding the first light, begin to thread the lights through the drilled hole toward the bottom and fill the bottle with lights.   Continue stringing lights until the bottle is filled. The plug should still be outside the bottle.	Remove label from wine bottle and clean well. Drill hole on the lower side of the bottle. Add marbles. String lights through the bottom of the bottle. Plug in the lights and illuminate the bottle.
Band rehearsals can be held for several reasons, most notably as "jam sessions," in-depth practices, or dress rehearsals.   A jam session is a relatively unstructured type of rehearsal. Rather than trying to address imperfections in the music, the band will play through a lot of material - often material that is either familiar or improvised. Jam sessions allow the band members to develop their overall sound, get more comfortable playing with each other, and have fun. An in-depth practice session is much more structured. This type of rehearsal involves spending lots of time on relatively little material - perhaps a single piece or even a few troublesome phrases within a piece. The goal is to fine-tune the music from both a technical and lyrical perspective. A dress rehearsal is a session held shortly before a performance. These serve primarily to warm the band up and keep the music familiar in their heads. Dress rehearsals should not be used to introduce new pieces or changes.; , Depending on the type of rehearsal being held, you may want to distribute some materials in advance. If an in-depth practice is scheduled, make sure the band members have copies of the musical score and an audio recording if possible. You should also consider distributing a copy of the rehearsal schedule detailing how the time will be spent.  The overall meeting time should be known by all band members well in advance. Short rehearsals can leave little time for anything but warming up, while excessively long rehearsals can lead to fatigue and distraction. A good starting point is a 3-hour rehearsal with a short break every hour.   As the rehearsal leader, make sure you know how the time will be spent. Plan time for the band's warm-up, and know how much time you want to spend on each piece or section. You can make changes to this schedule as needed during the rehearsal. Make sure to include time for band members to set up. Drum sets take time to set up, for instance. String instruments ideally need time to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the room in order to stay in tune. Consider opening the rehearsal space for an hour or so before the practice begins.  Strive to begin practicing right on time with a group warm-up. Use the schedule as a guide, but make sure to attune yourself to the band's needs. Allocate extra time to sections that need work, while spending less time on better-sounding sections. If you are also acting as a lead performer, make sure to take control of each song's direction. The band should respond to cues from the lead performer, not the other way around.  When the rehearsal is over, make sure all the band members know when the next rehearsal is and what the band's goals are for the time in between. Each player should have a good idea of what needs to be practiced at home and what to expect in the next group rehearsal.	Determine the type of rehearsal you want to hold. Distribute the necessary materials before the rehearsal. Schedule the band rehearsal. Conduct the rehearsal according to the schedule. Make sure the band members know what to practice at home.
