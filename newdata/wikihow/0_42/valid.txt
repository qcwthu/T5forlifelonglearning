Then, unfold them and use the tuck them into the folds that you have made previously. These folds will be directly below the corners that you just folded down, so it should be easy to figure out. These will become the ears. , Fold both sides in and down from the top right and left corners until they meet in the middle.  The next step is to fold the ears out. Find the corners that you tucked inside those pleats you made earlier. Unfold them so that they're sticking out.  Now you need to fold down the head. Fold down the top of the paper so that the double crease you made earlier is on top of the creases you made after your third and fourth pencil marks.  If you want, you can sculpt Yoda's expression by pulling at the eye and mouth pleats. You can even make Yoda's ears pointier and more wrinkled by pulling at them and crinkling the paper.	Fold down the top two corners. Flip the paper. Make your ears. Make your head. Gently pull at the pleats.
If you have the kind of job that you can do absolutely anywhere as long as you have a computer, try taking your work to a coffee shop one day a week and see how it feels. If you feel more focused and organized in this type of work environment, and less tempted to do chores or text your friends, then maybe this is a better work environment for you than your actual home.   Working in a coffee shop, library, or another place where people are also working can also be good for your mental state. You will feel less isolated and more part of a working community.  Though you may spend all day at work online, don't get distracted by checking your email, Facebook, favorite news sources, or any other favorite websites too often. Though you may not think that clicking on your five favorite websites every five minutes is making you lose time, that time not only adds up, but keeps you from fully focusing on your tasks.   Reward yourself by letting yourself browse the Internet every hour or so, when you need a break. If you really need your email to stay connected at work, then leave it open, but if you don't get any urgent messages, try to check it every half hour or hour or so.  Do not chat with your friends while you're working. This will slow you down exponentially.  Though you may think that multi-tasking will help you get more things done and finish your work day faster, you'll actually be more focused if you complete one type of work at a time. Go down your to-do list one item at a time, and you'll be shocked by how much faster you'll get things done than if you try to finish four things at once.   If you're multi-tasking, you'll never be fully engrossed in one task and will be more likely to get distracted and to make a mistake.  Taking a break from time to time will actually help you stay focused. Let's face it -- no one spends eight hours straight working in an office, and neither should you. You should do something to take a sanity break every hour, whether it's to munch on an apple, take a short walk, or just read on your porch and breathe in some fresh air. Taking breaks will actually make you more focused when you do get back to work.Try to go out for lunch or to pick up lunch as often as you can. Though you may spend some money paying for lunch, getting into this routine will help you stay refreshed and will split up your work day. Make a goal of leaving the house at least once a day. You'll start to get cabin fever if you don't leave your house at all. Rest your eyes. If you've been staring at a monitor all day, take at least a five-minute break to rest your eyes to avoid straining them and getting a headache.	Change your environment to avoid getting distracted. Don't spend too much time browsing the Internet. Avoid multi-tasking. Take occasional breaks.
The biggest benefit to fleet vehicle leasing is the cash that becomes available for your business. A significantly smaller upfront investment is required when you decide to lease rather than own your fleet. A well-written lease agreement reduces fleet costs to a monthly operating expense, while keeping credit lines clear and cash on hand to re-invest into the company. The money that would have gone into buying and maintaining a fleet can be used to grow the core business.; , Choose the right lease. A commercial vehicle lease typically comes in one of two categories: Open-End lease or Closed-End lease.   The vast majority (about 95%) of organizations in the United States and Canada that lease vehicles through a fleet management company choose to utilize an Open-End structure, because it allows these organizations to manage the vehicle as a corporate asset and more easily deal with issues such as turnover, territory changes, etc. That’s because, unlike Closed-End leases, Open-End leases generally entail no mileage limitations, no penalties for early termination (after a 12-month minimum term) and no penalties for excess wear and tear. At resale, under an Open-End structure, the lessee will generally receive a credit or debit based on the difference between the net sale proceeds and remaining book value; in a Closed-End structure, the lessor typically keeps the resale proceeds if net sale price exceeds remaining book value or eats the cost if sale proceeds are less than remaining book value. Closed-End leasing may be appropriate in certain situations, such as where executive vehicles are provided primarily as a perk and a set monthly price is desired. These vehicles tend to have low mileage, making them less likely to incur penalties, and they typically don’t need to be moved based on circumstances such as turnover or territory realignments. But for most fleets in North America, Open-End leasing is the more appropriate option.  Companies that own their fleet are responsible for a variety of administrative duties. The titleholder must deal with everything from taxes owed to license renewals. When leasing a fleet, the leasing provider typically handles a variety of fleet management tasks, including paperwork and record keeping, leaving you to concentrate on your core business.  Many fleet leasing providers offer programs to ensure the routine maintenance of vehicles, including roadside assistance. These programs are usually covered with a flat monthly fee, allowing you to build the cost into an op-ex budget. And since most leased vehicles fall on the newer side, there are generally fewer maintenance issues and less down time overall.  Fleet leasing providers typically offer a number of tools to help their clients manage expenses easier. Many offer online fleet management tools to track a fleet’s costs, history and lease terms, along with other necessary information. These tools have made fleet management much less time consuming, resulting in reduced costs. By monitoring expenses more closely and accurately, problems can be identified and dealt with immediately.  Many fleet leasing providers offer fuel programs that help control spending at the pump through regular odometer updates and other tools. Fuel programs also often provide preventative maintenance scheduling and fleet cycling, which can help to control fleet costs over the longer term.  Simply put, “value leasing” programs provide late-model vehicles that typically look and perform “like new,” yet can save up to $100 per month, per vehicle, depending on the type of vehicle and the terms of the lease. Many of these vehicles even have remaining coverage under the original manufacturer’s warranty.  Corporate vehicle leasing can provide significant tax benefits, which vary depending on the type of lease. With an operating lease (the most common type of lease when it comes to commercial enterprises), you treat the lease payments as an expense on the income statement, with the lease obligation footnoted on the balance sheet. In this way, you can gain significant financial tax benefits without the full lease obligation affecting the balance sheet. Alternatively, in a capital lease, you are treated as the owner for tax purposes. By assuming some of the risks of ownership, you can claim depreciation on the asset each year and deduct the interest expense of the fleet lease payments.  A less tangible benefit to commercial vehicle leasing is the ability to keep a more modern, reliable, and better-looking fleet on the road. It can sometimes be overlooked that a company’s fleet is a representation of the company itself, and a fleet consisting of vehicles of varying quality, age, and looks can sometimes send a mixed message. With an updated fleet, drivers benefit from updated technologies, improved safety features, and better fuel economy.	Take advantage of freed up cash. Choose the right lease. Save on administration costs. Adopt a maintenance plan. Use technology to reign in costs. Take advantage of fuel programs. Consider “value leasing” programs. Explore tax benefits. Boost your company image.
Place your basic supplies and most commonly used items in the top drawers so they’ll be close at hand. This includes things like writing utensils, envelopes, important forms and file folders. Save the bottom drawers for backup supplies, reference materials and documents that you only need to look at occasionally. Take a little extra time to organize the contents of your desk drawers so that you’ll know exactly where everything is when you need it.Stock up on copy paper, printer cartridge refills, ink pens, staples and other items you tend to go through quickly to create a ready cache of supplies. Drawers are particularly at-risk zones for clutter. Go through your drawers every couple of weeks and get rid of anything you don't need that's interfering with the efficiency of your desk's layout.  All the drawer space in the world won't do you any good if the drawers themselves are a jumbled mess. Stop simply throwing things into your desk and instead use a compartmentalized drawer organizer that does the work of sorting and storing for you. Dedicated organizers will prove useful day in and day out, as they allow you to separate your supplies however you see fit while keeping them together in one place.Label the various compartments of your drawer organizer so that its contents are immediately identifiable. For especially large or full desks, try running with multiple organizers of different sizes and configurations that are conducive to keeping track of your supplies.  If your laptop, tablet or smartphone plays an integral role in your work, feel free to leave them out, but isolate them to one corner or a special drawer. That way, they won’t end up spread out over the desktop. Try not to rely on too many devices at once, as they can quickly become an aggravation rather than an aid.Set up a “charging station” near an outlet or electrical strip where your devices can remain plugged in and ready for use.In general, it’s best to only use your digital devices when they’re strictly necessary. Electronics contribute to a lot of mental clutter, as well.  Backpacks, purses, laptop bags, lunchboxes and other carriers are bulky and take up a lot of space, so it doesn’t make sense to cover your desk with them. Stash these accessories elsewhere, preferably beside or underneath your desk where they’ll be accessible without being an obstacle. Try to pack your essentials in as few bags as possible on the way to work each day.Take advantage of lockers or break rooms for storing personal belongings if your company offers them. When storing larger accessories at floor level, try not to obstruct existing walking space.	Use your drawers. Invest in a drawer organizer. Have a dedicated spot for electronic devices. Keep bags and briefcases out of the way.
As with wood and other upholstery, hold the hose directly above the soot, getting it as close as possible without touching the soot or leather directly.  Stiff leathers are a little more durable than other types of fabric upholstery, so you can pass a brush over the soot without risking immediate staining. Pass the brush over the soot lightly, once or twice, to remove free-standing soot. Do not rub.  Use the same method described for wood, passing clean portions of the sponge over the soot in unstopping lines.  Leather usually benefits from oil treatments, and the fibers that make up leather allow oil to pass in and out without too much difficulty. Since soot is oil-based, you may be able to work soot out of the leather by drawing and drying it out. Both corn starch and talcum powder are effective drying agents. Liberally sprinkle either powder over the soot and allow it to sit overnight before brushing it off.  If you cannot draw the soot out of the leather, a leather cleanser may do the trick. Look for a cleanser specifically designed to treat soot or oily stains to reduce the risk of making the stain worse.  Deep stains may require professional treatment for removal. Sensitive leathers, like suede, should not be home treated and should be taken in for professional cleaning from the start.	Vacuum the soot spot with a plain hose. Switch to the brush attachment and give the area a light sweep. Wipe the leather down with a dry chemical sponge. Cover the remaining soot with corn starch or talcum powder. Use specialized leather cleaner on smooth, treated leather. Take any deeply stained leather or sensitive leathers, like suede, into a professional cleaner's establishment.
If you believe you were searched in violation of your Fourth Amendment rights, the first thing you should do is record your account of the search while everything is still fresh in your mind.   Include as many factual details as possible in your account, including the date and time of the search and the names and job titles of school officials involved. Recount where and how the search took place – these details may make a difference in whether the search was reasonable or violated your Fourth Amendment rights. For example, if you were patted down in front of a classroom of students, a court might consider that excessively intrusive because of the embarrassment caused by you being singled out and patted down in front of your peers – even though pat-downs are generally permissible in the school setting. On the other hand, if you were called out of class and patted down in a private location such as the principal's office, that search typically would not be considered unreasonable providing the search was justified.; , Generally, school officials must have a reasonable suspicion that a search will uncover evidence of illegal activity. You must know why school officials searched you to analyze whether an individualized, reasonable suspicion existed.Reasonable suspicion is something less than the probable cause required for police to get a warrant to search. This lower standard may mean that anything school officials find wouldn't be admissible in court. For example, if school officials had reasonable suspicion to believe a student had illegal drugs in her backpack, and a search revealed illegal drugs, that evidence could be used to impose school discipline on the student. However, it couldn't necessarily be used in a court prosecution of that student, even though the drugs were a violation of the law as well as a violation of school rules. The "reasonable suspicion" standard is not one that has been defined by the courts. Therefore, you must compare your school's reasons to reasons provided by other schools in court cases to determine whether the school's suspicion could be categorized as reasonable. The Supreme Court has ruled that school searches must be justified at their inception. This means that reasonable suspicion must exist before you're searched – the school can't use the fact that they actually found something illegal when they searched to justify the search after the fact.  The lesser standard of reasonable suspicion only applies to school officials – not to police officers, even if they are employed by your school. If a police officer conducts a search of you or your belongings, they must have a warrant.This applies to "resource officers" as well, even if they are not employed by the school or are considered off duty while working with the school. If someone has a law enforcement badge, they must get a warrant based on sufficient probable cause to conduct a search of you or your belongings. School officials have a lower standard because courts recognize that it would be impractical and potentially dangerous to require them to get a warrant. Teachers and school officials have a substantial need to maintain order and control in the school setting that requires more flexibility. However, this lowered standard doesn't extend to police officers on school grounds.  Get statements from anybody who was present when the search took place, or who has information regarding why the school decided to search you. These statements may assist you in proving the school violated your Fourth Amendment rights.   Witness statements can be especially useful if the school official who searched you relies on one reason to justify the search, while another teacher or administrator claims a different reason was used initially. If school officials relied on information from a source, such as a teacher or another student, to justify the search, try to find out who the source was and talk to them as well. You need to verify what they said. For example, suppose a fellow student told the principal that she was in the bathroom and overheard two students talking about smoking marijuana at lunch time. She didn't know who the students were, but she knew they were in her class because they were talking about the test being given that day. If the principal used that information to justify searching all the girls in the class for marijuana, the search generally would violate those students' Fourth Amendment rights. The principal did not have an individualized reasonable suspicion that any one girl in particular had marijuana on her person.  Generally, a school must have individualized suspicion to search you. This means school authorities cannot search everyone in a class because they heard someone had drugs – they must have a reason to suspect each individual they search.Keep in mind that this does not apply to drug-sniffing dogs, and generally does not apply to locker searches – although locker searches only involve items in plain sight, and school officials cannot open any closed bags or boxes within lockers. The Fourth Amendment generally is designed to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, courts have ruled that students don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their lockers, since the lockers themselves are owned and provided to them by the school. There also is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the air surrounding your belongings, so drug-sniffing dogs can walk classrooms, hallways, or student parking lots and identify anything in "plain smell." If a drug-sniffing dog alerts to a smell on your belongings or clothing, this provides school officials with the necessary individualized reasonable suspicion to justify a search.  A school search must not be excessively intrusive in light of your age and gender. Some types of searches that would be okay for older students may be unreasonable for younger students.Keep in mind that it all goes back to your reasonable expectation of privacy, and this depends very much on who you are. For example, courts have repeatedly held that teenage girls have a higher reasonable expectation of privacy than other students. These considerations also differ depending on the gender of the school official conducting the search. For example, it typically would be seen as unreasonable for a male teacher to conduct a pat-down search of a female high school student. Most states have laws prohibiting strip searches of students regardless of their age or gender, but strip searches of young children in particular are never appropriate. On the other hand, older students may have heightened expectations of privacy in their belongings relative to young children. For example, a kindergartner who frequently has help from teachers or parents to pack his school bag each day would have a lesser expectation of privacy in that bag than a high school student would.  For a search by school officials to be reasonable, its scope must be reasonably related to why you were searched and what school officials believed they would find.A search of greater scope might be justified if the school is looking for items such as firearms or other weapons that pose an immediate danger. However, if the safety risk is minimal, an extensive or intrusive search typically violates the student's Fourth Amendment rights. For example, suppose your school prohibits students from having playing cards at school. The principal has a reasonable suspicion that you brought a deck of cards with you to school. This might give her justification to search your locker or your backpack – however, a strip search to locate a deck of cards typically would be considered far outside the realm of reasonableness. Many states have outlawed strip searches of students in school at any time and for any reason. Prohibited strip searches don't necessarily have to involve full nudity. The definition typically includes searches in which the student is asked to remove all clothing but remains in his or her undergarments.  School authorities must have reasonable suspicion to search you. However, if you consent to the search, they don't even need that. Your consent means they can search you for no reason at all, so when in doubt, don't consent to the search.Keep in mind that even though you may be pressured, you never have to consent to be searched. School officials may try to convince you to consent because they don't actually have an individualized reasonable suspicion that you are violating school rules. If you consent to a search, you give up any right you may have had to challenge the search later. A search to which you consented can never violate your Fourth Amendment rights, even if you were unaware of the scope or extent of the search before you consented.  Typically any searches will be conducted under an existing policy or procedure outlined in the school's handbook. If that policy or procedure violates students' Fourth Amendment rights, it should be changed.If you don't have a copy of the most up-to-date school handbook, ask a school administrator or guidance counselor for a copy. You also may be able to download a copy from your school's website. Keep in mind that sometimes school handbooks aren't updated as frequently as they ought to be, and your school may have policies or procedures in place that allow searches of students that violate their Fourth Amendment rights. Analyze the procedures and policies carefully using what you've learned about your Fourth Amendment rights in the school setting. If you find a policy or procedure that allows students' constitutional rights to be violated, make a note of it. You also can use the information in your student handbook in the event you become the subject of a search. If school procedures have been carefully designed to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of students, your search may be unreasonable if it violates those policies or procedures. The existence of written procedures establishes what is reasonable, and if a school official violates those procedures you may be able to argue the search was unreasonable solely on the basis that it violated established school protocol.  If you believe your school violated your Fourth Amendment rights, you need to have an adult on your side to strengthen your voice and help you navigate the system.   It also can help to talk to your parents. You may have a lawsuit against the school, but you can't file a lawsuit as a minor without your parents' assistance. There are many nonprofit organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union that have resources available to help students prove their school violated their Fourth Amendment rights. If you have additional questions or concerns about your school's search procedures, or find it difficult to talk to authority figures at your school about the situation, you might want to look for a local office of one of these nonprofit organizations. You also may be able to contact civil rights organizations by searching for them online and sending an email. When you speak with an adult, show them the written account you made of the search to which you were subjected and any other information you have about the situation so they are better equipped to help you.	Write out what happened. Find out why you were searched. Identify who searched you. Talk to witnesses. Identify how many students were searched. Consider your age and gender. Compare the scope of the search to the reason for the search. Refuse to consent. Study your school's rules and procedures. Talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor.
In order to identify the type of maritime lawyer that you need, you have to first identify your underlying legal issue. For example, you could have a claim for injury, breach of contract, or a claim against your employer. You may also need a maritime contract specialist to review your shipping contracts or charter boat contracts. It is important to locate a maritime lawyer that specializes in the area of law specific to your needs., Maritime law regulates commercial practices related to shipping, navigation, or any other business practices that are related to work that is based on the operation of a ship. This could include hiring a charter boat for pleasure or entering into shipping contracts with a major shipping firm.   If you are looking for a lawyer who drafts or reviews contracts, you should look for someone who has a specialty in maritime commercial and/or contract law. If your dispute is related to a breach of contract, i.e. someone failed to uphold his or her obligations under a written agreement related to shipping or commercial use of a boat, you will need a maritime lawyer who specializes in contract law and is an experienced trial lawyer., If you are injured while working on a boat or as a passenger, you may have a claim under maritime law related to personal injury. While these actions are similar to injury actions that happen on land, the actions are governed by separate bodies of laws and rules.   Injury claims can occur from boating accidents. Negligent maintenance of a ship or boat. Actions can also be related to injuries caused by defective products, such as a jet ski malfunctioning. This area of law is known as products liability law. Seamen or other maritime workers may suffer an injury while working. So long as the person was legally allowed to be aboard the ship, and suffered an injury because of someone else’s negligence, that person may have a claim under maritime personal injury or products liability law. When choosing an attorney, you need to choose an experienced maritime trial lawyer that specializes in the applicable area of law, such as personal injury or products liability.  Maritime law has specific statutes that govern how to handle injuries to employees that occur during the course of that person’s employment. An employee who was injured while working because of his employer’s negligence may have a claim under the Jones Act. This federal law governs injuries that occurred in the course of a person’s employment while they were working on a vessel in navigation.   Depending on whether you work as a seaman, longshoreman or on an oil platform, there are different laws that govern employee actions for injuries sustained while working.If you were injured during the course of your employment related to a boat or other maritime employment, it is important that you seek out a maritime lawyer that specializes in worker’s compensation cases.  Since maritime law is a less common legal specialty and due to the number of specializations within maritime law, you should begin your lawyer search using a legal directory such as the Martindale-Hubbell database. This online search allows you to view lawyers by region and by specialty in maritime law. It also allows you to search by maritime specializations such as finance or workers compensation. This type of search should help streamline the first stage of locating a maritime lawyer., Once you have identified a number of law firms that handle your specific type of maritime claim, you can look at online law firm rankings, such as those conducted by US News, to see which law firms in your area are well regarded.Choosing a high-ranking law firm may be especially important for large commercial cases, where a law firm’s reputation may assist in your negotiations.   If you have a smaller claim or you have limited resources, it may not be in your best interest to select a large, high-ranking law firm to represent you. In these cases, rather than rely on rankings, you should contact state and local bar associations, maritime legal associations, and interview potential law firms and lawyers (as discussed below).  In addition to searching legal directories and lawyer rankings, you can contact maritime-specific law associations to assist you in finding a maritime lawyer in your area. These associations are filled with members that primarily practice maritime law. By contacting a law association, such as the Maritime Law Association of the United States, the organization can direct you to maritime-related legal resources as well as attorneys., Generally, local or state bar associations provide attorney referral services for individuals looking for a lawyer. You can contact a local or state bar association and request the names of lawyers in your area who practice maritime law. You can also ask whether any of the lawyers identified were ever sanctioned by the bar association or if any complaints were ever filed against them. The American Bar Association has a list of state-by-state contact information for state and local bar associations on its website., Unlike other areas of law, most people will not have hired a maritime lawyer. However, if you are part of a boating community or your family and friends are involved in shipping or other maritime-related industries, they may be able to provide you with the name of a maritime lawyer that they used.   Even if you are looking for a different maritime legal specialty from the attorney referred to you, it may be useful to contact that attorney and ask for a referral to someone else. Most attorneys have a network of attorneys in separate specialties to whom they refer cases.  Once you have identified several maritime lawyers that seem to work within the specialty that you need, you should create a list of those lawyers. The next step is to examine each lawyer more closely to see who would be the best fit for your case, your personality, and your budget.  Once you have narrowed down the list of potential maritime attorneys, you want to closely examine their website and the individual attorneys’ biographies. You want to make sure that maritime law is a significant part of the lawyer’s regular practice and not just one of many areas of law in which the lawyer handles cases. When reviewing individual attorney biographies, look for the following:   Does the lawyer list maritime law under his or her areas of practice? Does the lawyer list a specific maritime law specialty? Did the lawyer attend a law school with a strong maritime law program? There are several schools that are known for their maritime law specialty, including law schools at the University of Miami, Tulane University, and Louisiana State University.Did the lawyer get a specialization in maritime law? Some lawyers, particularly if they did not study maritime law may get a legal degree beyond their juris doctor (JD), known as an LLM. This is a master’s degree in a specific area of law, such as maritime law. While this is not required to practice maritime law, it can be one factor that you consider in choosing an attorney. Does the lawyer list past maritime cases that he or she handled successfully? Attorneys who are promoting an expertise in an area of law will sometimes list cases that they handled successfully on their website.  If you haven’t already done so (as discussed above), you should contact the state bar association in the state that the attorney practices law and ask whether anyone has filed any complaints against the lawyers with whom you are considering working. While a complaint should not completely rule out an attorney, it may be a factor to consider when deciding between two equally qualified lawyers., After reviewing the lawyers credentials and checking with the state bar association, you should narrow down your list of attorneys to the top three potential candidates. You should then contact each lawyer’s office and make an appointment to discuss your potential case.   When you make the appointment you should ask whether the attorney offers free consultations with prospective clients. If you are calling about a maritime-related personal injury case, the attorney should meet with you for free.  On the day of your appointment, you want to arrive about 10 minutes early so you have a chance to evaluate the office and how the receptionist treats you and other callers or visitors. Make sure that you bring any documents, photos, or other information relevant to your potential case. When you meet with the attorney, consider asking the following questions.   How long have you practiced maritime law? Who is your typical client? You want to determine whether the attorney generally represents individuals or businesses similar to yours. On average, how many maritime cases do you handle a year? You should follow up on this question by asking, “what percentage of your overall practice is focused on maritime cases?” Ask whether the attorney handles maritime cases specific to your case, such as maritime personal injury, products liability or maritime contract law. With whom will I communicate about my case? Communication is an important part of the attorney-client relationship and you want to make sure that you will have access to your attorney when you have questions or concerns. Based on the information that I provided, what is the likely outcome of my case? An attorney cannot predict the outcome of your case. By asking this question, you are looking for an honest and open response from the lawyer., During your initial meeting with the attorney, you should discuss the cost of the case and the attorney’s fees and costs. If an attorney is reviewing or drafting contracts, the attorney may request that you pay a certain amount up front to cover the cost of fees and costs. You should ask the attorney to detail the hourly rate for attorneys and others working on the case and to provide you with an estimate for the overall expense of the case.If you are seeking a maritime personal injury lawyer, your case should be accepted on a contingent fee basis. This means that you do not pay anything up front and the attorney gets compensated only if he or she wins or settles the case. If a maritime personal injury attorney asks you to pay for the fees up front, you should speak with another attorney., After meeting with several attorneys, you should decide which attorney to hire. When making this decision, you should consider the attorneys’ experience, demeanor, maritime specialization and fee arrangement. You should also trust your instincts. If you felt more comfortable with one attorney over another or you felt that an attorney seemed to have more time for you than the other attorneys, this should weigh into your decision. You are going to have to work with and trust the lawyer you choose so it is important to find someone with whom you feel comfortable.	Determine the type of legal claim or legal work that you have. Decide whether your legal needs are related to your business. Consider the source of your injury, if applicable. Recall whether you were working when injured. Conduct a legal directory search. Review maritime law firm rankings. Check with maritime legal associations. Contact local or state legal bar associations. Ask for a referral from family and friends. Create a list of potential maritime lawyers. Review the lawyers’ credentials. Contact state bar associations. Schedule an appointment. Meet with the attorney. Discuss the fee arrangement. Make a decision.
Purchase a 12” x 12” 10 quart steel bucket with an open top. This common steel bucket can be purchased at most home and garden stores. Because of the heat you will generate, it is important that you use a steel bucket. Other materials may melt or become brittle under the intense heat generated by your foundry.  In a five quart bucket, or larger, mix 21 cups of plaster of Paris, 21 cups of play sand, and 15 cups of water. Quickly stir the ingredients together by hand. It is important to moisten all of the dry powder and work out any lumps. After a few minutes of stirring, the mixture should be runny and a uniform color. Because the mixture will set in roughly 15 minutes, it is important that you do the step with some urgency.  Once you have worked out any lumps, slowly pour the insulation mixture into the steel bucket. The fluid should fill the bucket, leaving about three inches of space at the top.To avoid creating a mess, pour slowly to limit splattering.  Fill a 2.5 quart bucket with water or sand and place it in the center of the insulation mix. Slowly push the bucket into the mix. Move the bucket up and down a few times to help level the mixture before it sets. Finally, hold the bucket still for two to three minutes and let the mixture set around it.Once the plaster has hardened, the small bucket should stay in place once you remove your hands. Let the plaster mix sit for one hour to harden. Clean off any splattered plaster from around the top edges of the steel bucket.  After the plaster has hardened, use a pair of pliers or channel locks to remove the plastic bucket you used to create the opening. Grip the bucket with your pliers and twist it in on itself. With enough torque, the bucket should cleanly pop free from the plaster mix., In order to promote air flow, you will need to drill a hole in your foundry for a blower tube. Use a 1-3/8” hole saw, attached to an electric drill, to cut a hole in the top line of the bucket (about three inches from the lid). Once you have cut through the bucket, position the blade at a roughly 30-degree angle and drill. This hole should be the perfect size to accommodate a one-inch steel tubing, which will act as your blower tube.The hole saw can found at your local hardware store. Make sure that your hole saw is capable of cutting through metal. Creating an angled air supply port will prevent molten aluminum from flowing out of the foundry if your crucible fails.  Take a 1” x 12” steel pipe and screw on a 1” PVC coupling at one end. Once you have attached the coupling to the steel pipe, slide a 1” x 24” PVC pipe into the smooth end of the coupling. The coupling should have a threaded end for the steel pipe and a smooth end for the PVC pipe.The blower pipe should fit smoothly into the air supply port, but not so snugly that it is difficult to slide it in and out of the hole.  Fill a 5 quart bucket with 10 cups of plaster of Paris, 10 cups of sand, and 7 cups of water. Stand up two 4” U-bolts in the plaster mixture, placing the ends with the nuts down in the mix. Let the plaster set for an hour. Once it has set, you can simply pop the lid out of the bucket. Finally, drill a hole in the top of the lid using an electric drill and a 3” hole cutting saw.The vent hole will relieve pressure inside the foundry and allow you to add metal without taking off the lid. Try to make the lid hole the same diameter as your crucible. This will help prevent heat loss when you melt your aluminum.	Make the outer body. Mix the materials for the lining. Pour the insulation into the bucket. Form the center of the foundry. Remove the inner bucket. Drill a hole for the air supply port. Make a blower tube. Create a lid.
Purchasing a high-quality scanner and photo editing software for your home computer can help make digital restoration at home possible. Invest in a photo editing program like Photoshop and a high-quality scanner that can scan images at a high dpi, or dots per square inch. The greater the dpi, the more detail the scanner will be able to capture. A dpi of 300 is recommended for most photographs.; , Gently place the photograph in the scanner, and select to scan the image at a high-resolution to capture as much detail as possible. When prompted, save the image as a TIFF instead of a JPEG. A TIFF is a larger file, but it will retain the detail and quality of the photograph.Once you have saved the image, open it in your photo editing software.  Use the cropping tool to remove any evidence of damage around the edges of the photograph. Edges of old photographs often curl when exposed to water or humidity. If your photograph has damage around the perimeter, cropping the image will quickly correct this problem.  Repair the color, brightness, and contrast issues before attempting to change any other imperfections or signs of damage. These can be adjusted by opening editing tools in Photoshop or another photo editing software. These levels can be altered by sliding your cursor along a scale until you produce your desired effects.   Increasing the brightness level can help brighten up a dark photo, or intensifying the contrast can bring out a washed-out, faded photo. Play with the color sliders to help remove unwanted tints. Save each version you create under a different file name so you can compare each version later and select the best restoration.  Using the Dust and Scratches filter or the Spot Healing Brush in Photoshop or a similar tool in other photo editing programs makes removing imperfections straightforward and simple.Magnify the photograph, and use the cursor to touch up the damaged marks. Work slowly and be sure to zoom out to check your progress as you work. This filter works by removing some of the details, so you will want to be sure that you are not overusing this feature.   Keep a window open of the whole photo so you can observe the changes as you make them.  If there are tears, rips, or missing sections of the photograph, you can use the Clone Stamp tool to recreate a portion of the image and fill in the damaged sections. After opening the tool, select the potion of the photo that you would like to clone or recreate and click it once. Move the cursor to the area you would like to repair with the material you just copied.  After you have restored the photograph, use an inkjet printer or a special photo printer with glossy paper to print out your restored photograph.	Get the right equipment for digital restoration. Scan the photograph. Crop the image. Correct the photograph’s tone. Fix scratches and dust marks. Fill in tears or missing portions. Print the image.
It means that whatever you are delivering to your customer has to be fit for the purpose the customer will give to it. In essence, for any goods or service you deliver to a customer, having utility means that the customer can enhance the performance of their own assets, or remove some sort of constraint that prevents them from receiving more value from their assets.   If it is a car wash, the car has to end up clean. If it is a snow plowing service, the customer has to be able to traverse the path you plowed as the customer defined. If it is a cellphone, the phone must be able to receive a signal, the customer must be able to dial a number and connect to someone on the other end of the call. If a computer report, the customer will have to be able to click on a button on the screen, the report must come out of the printer and it must be complete and correct.; , It means that the goods or services that you deliver to your customer must be fit for use.   The car wash, for example, has to be open at the time the sign says the business will be open, and it must be able to handle the demand for its use, otherwise the line will grow long, customers will tire of waiting and will leave. The service must be as secure as the customer expects; no undue risks for the driver or passengers, for example. If the service fails, it should be restored within the period of time the customer considers reasonable, otherwise the customer will go find another car wash. The same concepts apply to all other goods and services. They have to be as available as the customer considers appropriate, provide the right capacity to meet the customer's demand, be as secure as the customer expects them to be and as continuous as is considered reasonable by the customer.  The easiest way to explain this is to think back to the day you bought your last automobile. Why did you pick that one? After all, all cars are the same –– four wheels, chassis, engine, transmission, differential, body, seats, steering wheel, glass, seat belts, etc... Or are they? The job of the salesperson who wants to make the sale is to identify these perceptions and determine the best way to present the service –– a car –– in a way that will convince the customer that this is the vehicle that meets all of the requirements, real and perceived.   Some customers will buy on the basis of the perception of reliability, created through personal experiences and/or word of mouth. Some will focus on price. Some will focus on the capacity, or the comfort of the interior. Some will want speed, others think there can never be enough airbags on a moving vehicle.  For example, most people would not pay $100 for a can of corned beef, right? However, put a person in a situation where that person has not eaten for days and that's all to be found, and that person will exchange anything of value for that food. The art of selling boils down to finding what the customer wants that they consider to be of value, and convincing them that what you have for sale will deliver that value.    Strategy is about deciding what you will offer that is of value to potential customers, how that value will be delivered, and how you will convince the customer that the value the customer wants should be obtained from you. In short, it's about defining the value proposition.  Marketing is about communicating the strategy and value proposition to a customer in a way that will make them want to buy the service or goods from you.  Where does money come into play in all of this? The customer must perceive that the total value of the service is higher than its cost, and produces a positive return. The return can be tangible (as in a positive Return on Investment) or intangible (as in an increase in the reputation of the customer's brand, or the goodwill of the customer's customers). Keep in mind that sometimes intangible returns can be much more valuable than tangible ones!	Understand that the first component of value is "utility.", Know that the next component is "warranty.", Strive to identify and overcome the barriers of the customer's perceptions. The perceptions of the customer are what makes or breaks the transaction that exchanges value for money. Remember that strategy and marketing are two different concepts. Pursue positive returns.
Photos from your last camping trip can showcase your adventures, or photos from your child’s first year can be a decoration for a first birthday party.  Collages can decorate a small area of a wall, or they can be the centerpiece for an entire room. Take into account how many pictures you have to work with; making a large collage will require lots of pictures.  These can come from just about any printed material, from magazines, newspapers, old books, or postcards. Even fabric can be used in collages. If you are doing a photo collage, you should select the best photos that represent the event or convey the theme you’re going for. Depending on how large your collage is, you may need to choose just a few pictures, or you may need 10 or more.   Consider how large you want your pictures to be in your final collage. The pictures do not need to be the same size, nor do they need to be the same shape. In fact, a range of sizes and shapes will give more dimension to your collage and make it more interesting to the eye. Think about if you want a certain picture to dominate the collage and have subordinate pictures surrounding it, for example. You don’t need to always choose pictures of people. Adding in pictures of details (a bridge or road, a plate of cookies, a deck of cards from a poker game) can add dimension to your collage. These add to the overall sense you’re trying to convey in your collage. Because you are creating a collage of many pictures, you can afford to include some background or detail pictures.  Your collage will look better if you have high quality images with sharp resolution (at least 300 dpi; 600 dpi for larger photos).  You can use all matching frames, or use frames that are all different shapes, sizes and colors. You can either have a professional framing service do this, or you can select your own frame. Choose a frame that is complementary in color to the collage. Have hooks on the back to enable easy wall hanging.  Start deciding how you want to place your pictures. Do this on the floor or large table so that you are not putting unnecessary nail holes in the wall. Keep an eye on the colors: are you grouping all the blue-toned photos together? Do you have a big spot of brown-toned photos? Spread the photos out to balance the color across the entire collage. Or, you might want only blue-toned photos in the collage so that it matches the room for which you’re making the collage. Test out different arrangements, patterns, and color schemes. You may also want to swap out a frame if it doesn’t seem to work in the overall arrangement.  Using plain paper or wrapping paper, cut out shapes that are the same sizes as your frames. You will use these to help you put nails in the wall on which you will hang the framed pictures. Stick these pieces of paper on the wall with removable tape. Refer to your frames that you’ve laid out on the floor as your guide.Mark on these papers where a nail would need to go. Nails would not go right at the very top center of each frame; rather, they will be down an inch or two, and perhaps there are two nails for a frame. Determine where the nails should go and mark it on each sheet.  When you’ve finalized where you want pictures to go, hammer a good quality picture-hanging nail into the wall at the point you’ve marked on your paper cutout. Check to see if your measurement is correct by putting the framed picture on the wall. Does it hang where you want it to hang?	Determine a theme and purpose for your collage. Determine the size and shape of your collage. Choose your pictures. Print out high quality digital photos on good paper. Select your frames. Map out your collage. Make paper cutouts of each frame. Hang your pictures.
Most clothes are machine washable, but always check the tag for further instructions. Some clothes might shrink if you use warm or hot water to wash. Some might be able to handle bleach and some might not. And some garments can't be washed in a machine, such as certain silks and delicates. Always check the label carefully.   Put aside clothes that are labeled as "hand wash only" or "dry clean only". In most shirts, clothing care labels are located on the inside left side of the shirt or inside the neck area. In most pants, clothing care labels are located on the inside of the back of the pants.; , Dyes in clothes, especially pieces that are new, lose their colour during a wash. The colour can bleed onto other clothes and damage your entire load. When you sort your laundry by "colour", this usually means differentiating them by shade. The most basic way to sort your clothes is to separate your darks from lights and wash them separately. You can even sort them more thoroughly by colour.    Darks include colours such as blacks, greys, dark blues, dark reds, and dark purples.  Lights include pastel colours like whites, pinks, yellows, light blues, light greens, and lavender.  Jeans or dark denims especially bleed their colour and should be washed in their own separate load.  Additionally or alternatively, you can protect your clothes from wear and tear in the washing machine by sorting heavier fabrics from lighter weight fabrics. Most washing machines spin and toss clothes around, and the extra aggravation from heavy fabrics might ruin lightweight fabrics. As well, if you're washing a delicate or lightweight load, the cycle's settings and temperature will be different from a heavier fabric load.   Delicates like lingerie, pantyhose, and washable silks should be washed separately.Heavy fabrics include items such as heavy cotton pants, bath towels, jackets, or sweaters. If you choose to sort only by fabric, you can save a lot of energy and money from having to wash multiple colour loads.  Instead of washing delicates separately, you can place delicates into mesh wash bags to protect them from harsh wear and tear. Mesh wash bags can come in various sizes but generally are used to protect only one or a few pieces of garments. They can be washed together with a normal load.          Mesh wash bags don't protect garments from colours bleeding, so be sure to wash them with similarly coloured loads. In most cases, delicates will not bleed and would be safe to wash with a light coloured load.  Some stains need special treatment before you can put the garment into the wash. The most popular stains that need pre-treatment are grease and oil stains.          Avoid washing or drying stained clothing in the machine. Certain stains set when heat is added, making them difficult to remove.  Wash cycles consist of two important speeds: a speed at which it agitates or tumbles the clothes with water, and a speed that spins the water out of the clothes.Depending on what you're washing, the wash cycle you choose should match what kind of fabric you're washing to help maximize cleanliness while also protecting your clothes.    Normal Cycle: This cycle goes with a fast/fast approach -- it tumbles fast and spins fast. It helps with cleaning very dirty and sweaty clothes, and is what you will most likely use on a regular basis. Sturdy fabrics like cotton, linen, denim, towels, and bedding do quite well in a normal cycle.  Permanent or Perm Press: This cycle goes with a fast/slow approach. These fabrics need fast agitation to be clean but a slow spin to prevent wrinkles. Use this cycle for synthetic fibres like rayons, knits, polyesters, and acetates. Synthetic fibres are known to pill, or create small balls of fibre and slow spin cycles help prevent pilling.  Delicate Cycle: This cycle uses a slow/slow approach, reducing agitation and preventing wear and tear. However, the level of cleanliness decreases with its slow tumbling. This cycle is best used for specific or special garments like lingerie, sequinned clothing, laced or loosely woven fabrics, or items made of sheer fabrics like pantyhose.  Special cycles: Newer models of washing machines have special cycles that do things such as sanitize, steam, or claim to protect whites and remove stains. Consult your machine's manual for further explanations on what each special cycle does.  In theory, the hotter the water, the cleaner the clothes. Hot water sanitizes and kills germs better, dissolves detergents more effectively, and removes built up grime so clothes look brighter and cleaner. However, in some cases, hot water can shrink clothes, fade fabrics, set certain stains in, and can be quite expensive for your energy bill.So choose a water temperature that your fabrics can stand but also what you can afford for the best results.   Use cool water in the delicate cycle for delicate items, items that have dyes that might bleed, or clothes that aren't especially dirty. Use warm water in the permanent press cycle, dark colours, and moderately dirty loads. Use hot water for bath and kitchen towels, bedding, sturdy fabrics, or any extremely dirtied items. Cold water is the most energy efficient way of washing clothes. About 90 percent of energy used in hot washing cycles is used to heat up the water.It is also the most gentlest way of washing your garments. For some machines, the water temperature is already preset according to what cycle you choose. For example, a normal cycle will most likely use hot water that is 30 °C or 40 °C (85 °F to 75 °F).  It's important to read your washer's manual and find out what type of detergent your machine can handle and also where to put the detergent. Most machines these days can handle liquid and power detergents, as well as other cleaning agents like bleach.          Front-loading washing machines usually have a drawer to dispense detergent and will have separate compartments to place fabric softener or bleach. Your machine will dispense the detergents at the right moment for you. Top-loading washing machines require you to pour the detergent right into the drum before you start your cycle. It's best to add your detergents before you load your clothes so the high concentration of detergent doesn't stain or damage your clothes. And in some cases, it's best to turn on the water so the detergent dissolves before you load your clothes in. The amount of detergent needed varies by brand of detergent and type of washer, so check the back of the detergent box and also look for any labels on your washing machine to find out how much to use.  This is pretty simple – just dump your clothes in, but be careful not to overcrowd your clothes. You need space for your garments to move and clean themselves. Some machines may even have options to indicate whether your load is small, medium, or heavy. This option adjusts the water levels within your wash cycle according to the size of the load.   Small loads fill about a third (1/3) of your machine. Medium loads fill half (1/2) of your machine. Large loads fill three fourths (3/4) of your machine.  Ah, sweet success, now all you have to do is hit that on button and you're ready to go! But remember to close the door!	Check the tags for special washing instructions. Separate your laundry by "colour". Sort your clothes by fabric weight. Put delicates into mesh wash bags. Separate out stained clothing. Choose the right washing cycle. Set the water temperature. Pour in detergent and other boosters like fabric softener. Load your washer with clothes. Turn on your washer.
If you have been cleaning the “green way” you most likely use white vinegar to clean a variety of items in your home.; , Either works just as well but if you use the juice from fresh lemons you can throw the peel into the garbage disposal to clean and freshen the drain--cleaning using the two-for-one method!  , If you are repurposing a spray bottle, especially if it contained cleaning chemicals, you will want to wash and rinse it extremely well.   Consider repurposing a spray bottle that contained window cleaner previously. For example, if the bottle used to house furniture polish there is still a chance some of the oil may be left over in the bottle and can diminish the power of your natural window cleaner.  A drinking glass will most likely do the trick or you can try to mix it directly inside the spray bottle.	Grab your trusty bottle of white vinegar. Locate a few fresh lemons or a bottle of lemon juice. Purchase or repurpose an empty spray bottle. Find a container to mix your window cleaner.
c5 - Moving the Queen Bishop pawn two spaces forward is the defining move of the Sicilian Defence. This aggressive first move is strong, because if an exchange occurs with White's queen pawn, then Black's center pawns outnumber White's center pawns, which will be an advantage later in the game. This move also avoids symmetry with White.; , The main advantage of this move is it clears the king side pieces in order to castle kingside soon. It is also strong as it controls one of the centre squares and prepares to play 3.d4. d6 - This logical move prevents White from playing e5, gaining space and stopping Black's knight from coming to f6. However many players also play 2... Nc6, 2... g6 or 2...e6 for a different setup.  White forms a pawn chain of their own. However, though this move is not bad it is very passive and does not try for an advantage, d4 is more aggressive and fights for the initiative and advantage. g6 - The final move of the pawn formation. This move sets Black up to complete a king side Fianchetto; finishing their defences and setting themselves up for a strong queen side attack. This is considered as the Dragon Variation. 5... a6, 5... e6, and 5... Nc6 are also playable	1.e4 c5   e4 - Moving the King Pawn two spaces forward is the most common move played in professional and amateur chess. 2.Nf3 d6   Nf3 - Moving White's knight to f3 is an aggressive move for White. 3.d3 g6   d3 - A common move in this situation.
Go for a walk in the park, your garden or in a field and look for healthy specimens. Pick them with lots of stem left intact.   Choose even sizes or a variety of sizes, depending on what you want to achieve with your artwork or craft project.; , This will keep them together and prevents them from being crushed by being held.  Yogurt or pudding bottles are ideal containers for squirting paint into, as they have wide openings to let your hand in easily.   Choose paints that will work on the medium you're pressing the flower heads onto, for example, glass paint if working with jars, paper paint if working with paper, etc.  You may need to snip the stem down a little to be able to hold it comfortably.  Don't immerse it completely––just aim for a light paint coating as evenly as possible across the flower heard.  This might be paper, a book, a jar, etc. Don't press too hard or too long, or the image will smudge and not be recognizable. Lift gently but quickly and leave the flower impression in place.  Either use the same flower and color or use different flowers with different colors/sizes. You'll need to use a new flower after a few presses, as the flower won't remain strong and the paint will clog the fine details quickly.  Done!	Choose large, fresh and firm dandelion flowers for painting with. Place in an ice cream container or similar for transporting back to your workspace. Arrange the paint colors in small containers. Choose a dandelion flower. Dip the flower into a paint color. Press onto the artwork object. Repeat. Allow the artwork or craft project to dry.
The easiest way to trade stocks will be to pay someone else to trade stocks. There are a number of well known stock brokers, and you should not have trouble finding someone who can place trades for you and give you advice.; , For people who are especially determined to make it on their own, there are a number of websites that will allow you to trade online. Acting as your own broker will give you a greater amount of control, and you’ll save yourself a little money. E*Trade, Fidelity and TD Ameritrade are some of the more popular websites to use.   Pay attention to the services offered by some of these companies. Some offer extra advice, tutorials, debit cards, mortgage loans, and other benefits. Weigh the benefits of each service and decide what is best for you.  When you trade stocks, you can buy or sell stocks with a market order. This means it will be traded at the best available price at that point in time. It is important to remember, however, that it takes a little while for a sale to go through, and if the market is changing very quickly, you may get a very different price than the one you originally saw. Use stop market orders. Also called a stop-loss order, this is similar to a market order except that the stock will be sold when it reaches a particular price. This is often used to avoid a loss in a falling market. , These can be used to set an upper or lower limit at which a stock could be bought or sold. Instead of a set price, it is a fluid price which is determined as a percentage of the current price. It is an extremely useful tool which can protect you from huge market swings. , Another option available to you is to place limit orders. These create a certain price window outside of which your stock will be bought or sold. This can help you get good prices. There is often a special commission on this type of order. Use stop-limit orders. This is a limit order which executes when a specified stopping price is reached. This provides even more control but, as with limit orders, you take the chance that your stock may not actually sell.  Many brokerage firms offer accounts which can store your money between trades and pay you a small amount of interest in the meantime. This is very useful and should be factored into your plans if you are using an online service.	Consider getting a broker. Find a website or service to use to trade stocks. Use market orders. Use trailing stops. Use limit orders. Store your money between trades.
Fabrics made of fiber blends are more susceptible to pilling. Fiber blends combine natural and synthetic fibers, and they are more likely to rub together and form pills. This is especially true for fabrics with three or more different types of fibers. , Check the fabric before you buy. Tightly knit fabrics are less likely to pill, whereas looser weaves or more susceptible to pilling , Turn the garment inside out before washing. This will prevent noticeable pilling as the fabric rubs against itself and other garments in the wash. You can also try storing the garment inside out by turning it inside out before hanging or folding it. , Use a delicate cycle when washing in the washing machine. Delicate cycles are shorter and gentler, causing less abrasion in the garments.   Consider hand washing garments like sweaters that are more likely to pill. This is the gentlest way of washing. Look for detergent made especially for handwashing and wash in a sink or bathtub. , When possible, hang garment to dry rather than using the drying machine. This will cause less abrasion to the fabric and prevent pilling. , Powder detergent rubs against the fabric as it dissolves. This makes it more likely to cause pilling during the washing cycle. Liquid detergents are the most gentle solution for delicate fabrics. , Be sure to regularly brush delicate sweaters with a lint roller or lint brush to prevent pilling. Consistently using a lint roller will prevent pills from accumulating on the fabric.	Shop for fabrics that are less likely to pill. Look for tightly knit sweaters. Turn your garment inside out. Wash gently. Avoid the electric dryer. Use liquid detergent. Brush with a lint roller regularly.
Communications lawyers need to have a diverse knowledge base spanning multiple legal disciplines. In general, a communications lawyer will deal with legal questions about the media and communications industry (e.g., television, radio, internet). Specific legal questions might include the publication of materials, ownership of broadcasted materials, and the transactions necessary to provide these services.Most, if not all, communications lawyers practice federal law as this is where a majority of the action is. Apart from completing transactions and bringing lawsuits, communications lawyers should also be great administrative lawyers who know how agencies regulate and enforce communications laws.; , If you need the services of a communications lawyer, start by asking around for recommendations. Often, friends or family will know someone who can help. These recommendations are priceless and can help you get a trusted and qualified attorney.   If someone gives you a recommendation, ask them about their relationship with the lawyer. Ask if they have used this lawyer's services before and if so how happy they were.  If you cannot get a personal recommendation, your state bar association can be an immense help in finding legal help. Every state's bar association has a legal referral service that helps match lawyers with clients. For example, in California, you can call a hotline and speak to someone about your legal problem. After answering a few questions, you will be given the contact information of multiple qualified attorneys in your area., After your initial search, use the internet to check the lawyers on your list and to find new lawyers. Communications lawyers should have robust websites because their work revolves around the communications industry, which includes the internet. Use a search engine and type in your lawyer's name. Find their personal or firm website and browse for a bit. The website should be easy to navigate and should have ample information on the attorney's background, their areas of practice, and their past cases.   Another great source of information can be lawyer review websites like Avvo and lawyer.com. Using these websites, you can find great lawyer candidates in your area as well as reviews.When looking at internet reviews, be aware they are not always telling the whole story. For example, a great review may be written by a close personal friend who has never used the services and a poor review may be from someone who got great legal advice but was unhappy with the outcome. A site like Avvo tries to approve every review put on their site in order to ensure accuracy.In addition, Avvo has their own rating system that can help you determine if a lawyer is a good choice.Using sites like this can really help shrink your list of candidates.  If one of your candidates is part of a larger law firm, you should not simply judge the lawyer alone. Look at the lawyers he or she works with, the other services the firm offers, and the locations where they offer services. While hiring a lawyer from a larger firm will often be more expensive, you may also get a team of lawyers and experts working on your case. For example, larger firms may have their own investigators, discovery teams, and appeals lawyers. Paying for these services may be worth it depending on how complex your communications issue is.  After you have conducted your initial research, try to narrow your list down to the top three or four choices. While your research up to this point is valuable, you will learn the most about a lawyer by conducting an initial consultation.  After you have a short list, contact each of the lawyers and set up an initial consultation. An initial consultation is a one-on-one meeting with the lawyer to discuss your case, the lawyer's background, and the options you have. When you contact the lawyer, ask if they charge for the initial consultation. Some lawyers will offer this meeting free of charge while others will bill for it. Schedule consultations with the lawyers offering free meetings first. This way, if you find the lawyer you want to hire early, you can avoid the other meetings altogether.  Before you attend your initial consultation, you need to prepare thoroughly to ensure you get the most out of the experience. If you do not prepare questions ahead of time, or fail to ask all of the pertinent questions, you may not get a good sense of the services an attorney can offer you. The first type of questions you should ask help you determine if the lawyer is a good personal fit for your case. For example, you might ask:   How long the attorney has been practicing law, and specifically how long they have been practicing communications law How many cases they are currently handling, and whether they can give their attention to yours Who they usually represent (e.g., the government, business owners, users) How good of a relationship they have with other lawyers, judges, and agency employees in the community Whether they work with a team of lawyers or if they will be handling your case alone Have they ever been sued for malpractice or do they have any history of discipline  , In addition to more general questions, you should also be prepared to talk about your case. When you go to the meeting, you should know as much about your legal issue as possible. This will make it easier for the lawyer to provide helpful answers. If you are paying for the meeting, ask as many questions up front as possible to make sure you are getting the answers you deserve. Common questions include:   Have they ever dealt with the Federal Communications Commission Do they deal with the specific radio station or television station your case is about What is the timeline for your case When can the lawyer expect to get started What will the lawyer do to get the result you want How strong is your case What are the chances of success Has the lawyer ever handled cases similar to yours Does the lawyer foresee any issues with your case  , Every lawyer should have insurance that covers professional liability and malpractice claims. While you hope your attorney will do a good job and they will not have to use their insurance, you want to make sure it is available. If your lawyer makes a mistake that costs you the case or business transaction, you may have to sue them to collect damages. If the lawyer does not have insurance, they may not have any money to pay you.   Malpractice and liability insurance will help cover the cost of mistakes. Always make sure your lawyer has enough coverage to deal with any possible losses you might incur.  Lawyers love documents that can help them understand your legal issues more clearly. As a non-lawyer, it can often be difficult to put your concerns into the legal terms your lawyer will need to put them in. Documents can help them understand exactly what you are trying to do. Make copies of all the documents you have and give the to the lawyer when you meet with them.Never give the lawyer originals. Those are for you to keep. However, if you are unable to make copies before the meeting, bring the originals and ask if the lawyer can make copies for you.  Attend your consultation on the day agreed upon and come ready and prepared to ask your questions. You should dress professionally as this is not only a test for the lawyer, but also for you. Remember, a lawyer does not have to accept any client they do not want to. In addition to dressing professionally, bring a notepad and a pen and be ready to take notes. Initial consultations will give you your first taste of representation and you will want to remember what the lawyer tells you.   Make sure you are honest and open with the attorney. It is imperative you do so if you want to get the most accurate information possible. Remember, any conversations you have with the attorney are private and cannot be discussed without your permission., If you cannot afford to pay an attorney for their services, you may be able to get legal help for free. Most communities will offer some form of legal services, but it is your job to find them. Legal aid agencies will often provide limited legal services to those who can prove a financial hardship. Most of these offices will only deal with housing and public benefits issues, which means they may not accept clients with communications law questions.   A great opportunity for free legal help may be through your local law school. Law schools will often offer their students an opportunity to take part in legal clinics, which involve taking on actual cases in a certain area of the law. All of the work is conducted by law students but overseen by a qualified attorney. If you live in an area with a law school, contact them to see if they have a communications law clinic. If they do, ask how you can apply for help., If you do not qualify for free legal services but you cannot pay hundreds of dollars in hourly fees, you may be able to reach out to nonprofit law firms offering their services on a sliding fee scale. If a law firm is operating as a nonprofit, they will usually offer services for a fee solely based on your ability to pay. The more money you make, the more you will pay for the services. In this way, the wealthier clients subsidize the lower income ones.   Fees often range from $60 to $145 depending on your legal issues and the money you make., If your income is high enough that you can afford the most common lawyer fees, you will usually see them in the form of hourly fees, flat fees, or contingency fees. Also, a lawyer may ask for a retainer fee in addition to having one of those fee arrangements. A retainer fee is an up front fee charged by the lawyer to cover legal work to be done in the future. For example, your lawyer may charge an hourly fee and ask for an upfront retainer to cover the first 40 hours of work. If any of the retainer fee is not used, it will be returned to you.   Hourly fees are based on the time your lawyer works on your case. These fees can range from $125 to over $500 per hour. Lawyers will usually bill in fifteen minute increments. If you are paying an hourly rate, you will usually receive a bill once or twice a month. Flat fees are one time fees paid for the lawyer to do a specific task. For example, your lawyer may charge $250 to prepare a nondisclosure agreement, another $500 for a purchase and sale contract, and $5,000 to represent you at an administrative hearing. Flat fees can be stacked on top of each other and can build up quickly. Contingency fees are available in certain circumstances but are barred in other types of cases. In a contingency fee agreement, the lawyer will not charge you anything up front but will take a portion of any award you receive as a result of the lawyer's work. A contingency fee can be anywhere from 20% to 50% of an award. If you do not win, the lawyer will not collect. Generally, contingency fees are reserved for trial situations.  Fees are set by the lawyer or the firm he or she works for and are often negotiable. Do not simply accept the first fee a lawyer throws out. Talk and try to understand why the fee is what it is. If you really like the lawyer but the fee is too high, see if you can make a deal. If the lawyer will not lower their fees, ask about the possibility of a payment plan or paying with property.   If they accept a payment plan, you will pay your fees in installments. For example, if the lawyer is charging a flat fee of $5,000, you might ask to pay five separate $1,000 monthly payments. Some lawyers will accept property in lieu of cash. In this instance, you would offer the lawyer real estate or some other property for their services.  Once you and the attorney agree on a fee arrangement, you need to get that agreement in writing. Most states require that contingency fee arrangements be in writing and they recommend that all other agreements be in writing.   In addition to getting the fee agreement in writing, you should also request a representation agreement in writing. This agreement will lay out exactly what services your lawyer will be providing for the fee they are charging., With all of the quality information you have compiled, you should be able to make an informed decision on the attorney that will be best for you. To help visualize your choices, make a chart identifying the positives and negatives of each lawyer. For example, one lawyer may have great fees but a poor record of success. While fees should play a role in your decision, it should not be the deciding factor. Oftentimes you pay for the representation you receive. Paying more may be better (but not always).   Find a lawyer that is knowledgeable and trustworthy. You may be working with this person for months, or even years, so you want to hire someone you feel comfortable with.  If you cannot make a decision or you have follow up questions, do not hesitate to contact the lawyer again. For example, if you have two great candidates but you can't remember what one of the attorneys would charge you, call and ask.  When you finish the process, contact your top choice and ask if they will represent you. While you want to take as much time as you need to hire the right person for the job, you should also expedite the process as much as possible. Some legal issues have time limits and must be handled quickly.   If the lawyer accepts your offer, you will enter into the professional relationship. If a lawyer is too busy or does not want to represent you, you will have to move forward with your second or third choice. Be prepared for this and have a back up plan.  Due to the lucrative business that is law, a lot of scammers exist to try and make money off of unsuspecting individuals. While most lawyers are quality individuals there to help you, some of them may be out to make an easy buck. Some lawyers may ask for an upfront fee and then never do any work. Other "lawyers" are not even licensed.  Lawyers are prohibited from making certain solicitations for business. They are bound by ethical obligations that limit the amount of advertising and soliciting they can do. In general, if a lawyer contacts you and asks for your business, you should be wary of hiring this person. While they may be a good lawyer, they are also breaking ethical obligations.   Be aware that there are exceptions to this rule and not every solicitation is improper. Make sure you understand these nuances before turning someone down., Before hiring any attorney, you need to make sure they are licensed to practice in your jurisdiction and that they do not have any history of discipline. To check these things, visit your state bar's website. There, you will be able to search for attorneys by their name, address, or bar number. A search will reveal if they are licensed in good standing and if they have any history of discipline.	Look for a specialist. Ask for recommendations. Contact your state bar association. Review internet resources. Look at the entire firm. List your top choices. Contact your top choices. Prepare personal questions for the lawyer. Plan to ask questions about your case. Ask about the lawyer's insurance. Gather documents. Go to your consultation. Look for free legal help. Inquire about sliding fees. Understand the most common fee arrangements. Negotiate with the lawyer. Execute a written fee agreement. Make a comparison chart. Follow up when necessary. Hire someone. Avoid scams. Identify improper solicitations. Look at a lawyer's credentials and history of discipline.
The towels will protect your floors by catching any dirt, dust, soap, and grime during the cleaning process. Additionally, make sure to remove any objects from your fireplace mantle., Use a handheld vacuum or attachment to remove loose dirt and debris from the limestone surrounding your fireplace. Make sure to remove the spinning brush attachment or turn it off to avoid scratching the limestone., Do this if you do not have a handheld vacuum, or if the spinning brush cannot be removed from your vacuum. Starting from the top of the fireplace, wipe it down using the microfiber cloth. Wipe your fireplace until all of the loose dirt and debris are removed.Loose dirt and debris can scratch your fireplace if it is not removed prior to the cleaning process.	Place towels at the foot of the fireplace. Vacuum the fireplace. Wipe the fireplace down with dry, microfiber cloth.
If a large object has become lodged in your garbage disposal, you will need to remove it before proceeding with the cleaning process. First, it is important that you turn off the fuse that supplies power to the disposal unit. This is to ensure that it does not turn on during cleaning.   Use a pliers or tongs to remove the trapped object (you may need to shine a flash light down to see) , being careful to avoid damaging the grinder.Avoid putting your hands down the garbage disposal if at all possible. If you do need to use your hands though, make sure to double check that the grinder won't turn on first.; , Simply flushing out the garbage disposal with water will help to remove any loose dirt or grime. Stopper the garbage disposal, add a squirt of dish soap and run the hot water until there is 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) sitting in the sink. Pull out the plug and turn on the garbage disposal, allowing the water to flush through.Make sure to use hot water rather than cold, as the hot water will liquefy any oil or grease in the drain, allowing to to be flushed away. Flushing your drain using this method is much more effective than simply running the tap, as it allows the entire garbage disposal to be rinsed out and purged of any built-up debris.  Grinding ice cubes and salt in your garbage disposal is a great way to remove tougher sludge and debris that has attached itself to the grinding elements. Pour two cups of ice into your garbage disposal, followed by one cup of rock salt.   Turn on the garbage disposal, run some cold water, and allow the ice and salt to be crushed by the blades.An alternative to the ice and rock salt combination is to make freeze some white vinegar into ice cubes and crush these in the garbage disposal instead. In addition to cleaning the garbage disposal, grinding ice will sharpen the blades and remove any unwanted odors.  It is also possible to manually clean the inside of your garbage disposal using an old toothbrush or even a scrub brush designed for garbage disposals. If possible, remove the screen from the top of the drain first, this will make it both easier to see and easier to clean., A great natural way to freshen up your garbage disposal and leave your kitchen smelling great is to grind up a handful of citrus peels. Any citrus fruit will do -- orange, lemon, grapefruit, lime. The citric acid in the peels will clean the blades and eliminate odors.  Baking soda and vinegar make a great odor-busting combo. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into the drain, then gently pour a cup of white vinegar on top. The mixture will fizzle and bubble. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then rinse it down with very hot or boiling water, with the garbage disposal running., Bleach is very effective at killing germs and will quickly freshen up your drain., however you don't want to use too much of it as it can also harden any grease in your disposal unit, making it difficult to remove.   Dilute a tablespoon of liquid chlorine bleach in a gallon of water and slowly pour it into your garbage disposal. Allow the bleach to sit there for a minute or two, then turn on the hot water tap and leave it running for several minutes to flush away the bleach., Borax is a safe and natural cleaning product which will effectively clean the garbage disposal and minimize odors. Simply put 3 or 4 tablespoon of Borax into the garbage disposal and allow to sit for about an hour. Then flush away with very hot or boiling water. , The number one rule when it comes to garbage disposals is to avoid putting anything down there which is not biodegradable. The garbage disposal is not a trash can, and using to get rid of unsuitable items is a recipe for disaster. You can minimize damage and cut down on cleaning time by only using the garbage disposal for biodegradable food items. Things you should avoid putting down there include:   Fibrous materials such as onion skins, corn husks, artichokes and celery stalks. These can get tangled in the motor. Starchy materials like potato peels. The starch may form a thick paste, causing the blades of the garbage disposal to stick. Expandable food such as rice or pasta. These may expand from the water and clog the drains. Coffee grinds can also clog the drains. You can however grind up items such as egg shells, small fish or chicken bones, and small fruit pits, as these will actually help in cleaning the garbage disposal., A mistake many people make is turning off their garbage disposal as soon as the grinding noises stop. It is better to leave the garbage disposal on (with the water running) for several seconds after the grinding noises subside, as there may still be small particles in the disposal unit which have not yet been cleared away.  It is not a good idea to pour any kind of oil, grease or fat into your garbage disposal. The grease can accumulate in the disposal unit, slowing down the motor and causing the drain to clog. Try to wipe off as much grease as possible from pans and roasting tins using paper towel, before rinsing., You can prevent large pieces of food from becoming stuck in your garbage disposal by cutting them into smaller pieces first. This is true for pieces of fruit and veg, or anything else you think your garbage disposal might have a hard time processing.	Physically remove lodged objects. Flush with water. Use ice cubes and salt. Scrub with an old toothbrush or scrub brush. Use citrus fruit peels. Use baking soda and vinegar. Rinse with a little bleach. Use Borax. Only put biodegradable food items in your garbage disposal. Run your garbage disposal for longer each time you use it. Avoid getting grease in your drain. Cut large food items into smaller pieces.
Being a good host is about making people feel comfortable from the minute they walk in the door. This means you need to do some preparation before your guest arrives. Clean the house, have a clear space for guest to put their bags/shoes/coat/umbrella. If you're planning on playing games or watching something, make sure that the supplies are easily accessible.Anything that could embarrass you may also make your guest uncomfortable: dirt, potentially-offensive books/magazines/movies, or having to root around in the closet or kitchen for something. Know your guests' allergies beforehand so you can be prepared. Consider allergies to food, drinks, animals, and cleaning products., When your guest arrives, lay down the basic house rules right away. This doesn't mean that you need to give them a lecture: it means being kind but clear about the expectations for the space in which they've found themselves.   If you like guests to remove their shoes, don't let them walk around for a bit and then comment on it. Pointedly take off your shoes and ask if they would like you to put theirs away too. They will get the hint. If you have furniture that you don't want your guests to touch or rooms that you don't want them to enter, be clear from the beginning to avoid awkwardness later on. Point out the bathroom right away. This way, no one will need to ask where it is in the middle of another conversation.  Don't pressure the guest to clean up with you, but don't deny them if they really want to help. Many people would rather contribute than be waited on. Having something to do takes the mind off of any lingering discomfort.   Give your guests little things to do, like emptying the table or putting the dessert on the table. If they offer to clean the dishes, you may find it most polite to decline and offer them a drink. Sit them at the bar in the kitchen and let them talk to you while you clean dishes. If they are determined, then leave the dishes, sit at the table and talk; ignore the fact that there are dishes to be washed.  No one likes to stand in the middle of a room, clutching their bag, wondering where to go. Put away whatever they are holding (if they want you to) and motion for them to take a seat. Offer to get them something to drink. Once they are settled in, it might even be nice to leave the room (maybe under the guise of getting that drink) so that they have a chance to take a break and look around.   If you are constantly with someone, they won't get the chance to absorb the environment, and they might be distracted while you are with them later. This does not mean leave them for a long time – a minute or two tops should do it. People like having things to do with their hands. So having a drink or munchies can help. Don't offer your guest food and not eat yourself, they will feel rude and gluttonous. Take some snacks too.  Inviting someone over and then asking them what to do is rude. They won't know what you can and can't do at your home, and they likely don't feel comfortable taking charge of someone else's territory. Even if you aren't sure if the guest will enjoy playing Scrabble, anything is preferable to sitting and staring awkwardly in opposite directions., One of your biggest jobs as the host is to keep everything going smoothly. You will need to set a positive tone, and act as moderator if anything goes awry. Be prepared to smooth tensions: always be ready to change the subject or talk to anyone who's causing trouble. Your social "job" as the host is to make sure that your home is a safe and welcoming space for all who enter – no matter who is causing the problems.   Consider coming up with conversation topics beforehand. Think about what you've been wanting to ask each person – about a new job, or a baby, or a big trip. Plan ahead so that you don't have to think about it much in the moment.	Prepare the house before your guest arrives. Be clear about the house rules. Give your guest the chance to help out, but make your expectations realistic. Make sure your guest is physically comfortable. Have a plan of events. Keep the conversation flowing.
A capital gains tax is a tax on the profits from the sale of an asset. The asset could be virtually anything, such as a home, a piece of land, stocks, bonds, collectibles—even an intangible asset, like a trademark or a patent.In this sense, capital just means money, and gains mean profit. Most people’s income comes from wages, and that’s mostly what ordinary income tax covers. So think of income tax as a tax on wages, and capital gains tax as a tax on selling things.; , If you derive all or most of your income from wages—a paycheck from an employer—then capital gains taxes probably don’t apply to you at all, because most people who derive most of their income from wages don't make enough money from the sale of assets for the capital gains tax to kick in. Also, there are a couple forms of income which are definitely derived from the sale of assets, but for one reason or another aren’t subject to the capital gains tax.Short term capital gains, or capital gains on assets held less than a year, are always subject to ordinary income tax rates. For example, a day trader who buys stocks and quickly resells them is subject to the ordinary income tax rate, as is an heir who immediately sells a piece of property they inherited. If the profits from the sale of your asset are less than $37,650 (or $75,300 for a married filer) AND the asset sold is something other than a collectible or small business stock, you pay no tax at all. Collectibles are items that people collect and sell, like a comic books or Beanie Babies.  If you have made more from the sale of an asset than the minimums described above, you’ll need to factor in your capital losses in order to get a clear picture of your capital gains.Calculating the net gain or loss is easy. You simply take your losses and subtract them from your gains. If you’ve lost more than you’ve gained, you won’t be subject to any tax. As long as the loss didn’t stem from the sale of personal property, like your residence, you can deduct up to $3000 per year from your personal income, and carry over additional losses into the following years. Say you had a net loss of $9,000 for 2016. You can deduct $3,000 from your income in 2016, another $3,000 in 2017, and another $3,000 in 2018--even if you had net gains in 2017 and 2018.  If you’ve still made more than the minimum after calculating your net gain, you need to decide which tax bracket you’ll fall into. You can take a look at the various tax brackets for single and married filers at http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Taxes-Whats-New.   The tax rate for collectibles is different than the tax rate for conventional capital gains. Capital gains from collectible are taxed at the same rate as income from wages, with a cap of 28% (instead of 39% for wage income).	Start at square one. Decide if capital gains taxes even apply to you. Take your losses into account. Determine which tax bracket you fall into.
You should get people who are very trustworthy, reliable, and quiet, but are stealthy, sneaky and skilled. You may want to recruit your friends, and people you know at school, or in your neighborhood. You can gather members before or after you start making the actual club, whichever you want. Just remember to be patient with any loud members. Remember to get people who will help you such as someone who knows how to use the computer well or a short person so they can fit into small spaces, people who have sharp eyes and smart.   Tech spy       Be sure that the people who have joined tell no-one, not even their moms, and make sure they follow all the rules.; ,: S.A.C., Secret Agency of Children) Make it something catchy and have it end with something cool like S.S. (Spy Squad)., Remember that you can have more than one of these positions in your club. It's good to have at least five members in your group for safety, fun and success.  Other positions you might consider are:   The Head Spy-the Head Spy controls the whole entire club and can change anything they want, whenever they want. This person is the most powerful person in the club. The Vice Spy-whenever the Head Spy is not there (maybe he/she is sick), the Vice Spy takes his/her place. The Computer Spy-the computer spy finds information, maps, and other things on the Internet, and sends the information to the head spy. The Conclusion Spy-The rest of the spies give all their information to the Conclusion Spy, and the Conclusion Spy tries to solve whatever case you are working on with all the information he or she has. The Regular Spy-the Regular Spy does a lot of the spying. He/she must be stealthy and must blend in easily, and also must be able to befriend even the worst people you could meet. The Photo Spy-the person who take the photos, videos, and recording. They gather information and give it to the conclusion spy. Trainee Spy-Trainees are simply people who are being trained to spy on people. The Head and the Vice Spy usually are the ones training a trainee. The Secretary-This should be someone everyone knows so they can come to them and you have a case! The Wheel Artist-This member has all of the transportation: It would be cool if they had a car, but a fleet of bicycles, scooters, or skateboards will do well too!       Spy Dogs-Spy Dogs are well-trained dogs that can be allies of the tracker: You can even put a tiny spy camera on their collar!        , or let them make their own. If they can make their own, you can give them guidelines to follow, like if your club is called The Shadows, you could make everyone have 'shadow' in their name (Shadow Dragon, Shadow Hawk, Shadow Bomber, etc.).  You could all wear rings of a certain style to show your membership, with other information scratched into the ring band, or have bracelets that can easily be hidden under a sleeve. , It is a good idea to have multiple headquarters, like an out-of-the-way spot at school, and maybe a secret area at each spy's hive where you can all meet if you are at their hive.  Also, you can find a place that is a fair distance from everybody's hive so that no one has to drive there. The clubhouse is where you should make all your meetings and stick special secret papers to the wall so that everyone in the club knows what's happening around the club. ,, (Uniforms can make you stand out and that is not usually desired with a spy club).	Gather members. Give club a name: (E.G. Make positions in your club, Head Spy, Scout, Tracker, Tech master, Wheel Artist, Stealth Master and Social Engineer. Make spy names for everyone: You can give names to members (make sure they like their name!), Create ID cards, badges, or some other token to identify people as members and what rank, position, and name they have: You may want to make this something that is inconspicuous or easy to conceal, so that it is revealed only to other spies. Now, you should make a secret password and secret handshake for your club: To make it fun you can all make one and have a vote if someone has a better one than yours.  , Make a clubhouse: You can use a small portion of a room, or a room altogether. If you would like, you can make a booklet for your club called a Mission Log: and in the booklet you put all the missions you have done and if it was a good mission or a bad mission.  , You could also make each member a Code Book so you can secretly communicate with one another using codes and ciphers.  , If you want to, you can make a club uniform: It might be dark red, blue or green and you can also make a badge for the club as well so if you see someone with that badge you know they are in the club.

Use a ruler or yardstick and a pencil to divide the tissue paper into four equal squares. Cut out the squares.  Fold the tissue paper one final time to make a triangular shape. Leaving the paper folded, use your scissors to round the corner opposite the fold. When you unfold the tissue paper, you will have a scalloped circle with eight equal scallops.  Pull the hook down into the paper so the hook is hidden in the poppy, then secure the hooked part to the poppy with a drop of white craft glue.	Spread a piece of red, orange, yellow, pink or gold tissue paper on a flat surface. Fold each tissue paper square twice, so the folds make four equal quarters. Push a green pipe cleaner up through the bottom of the shape, with about an inch of the pipe cleaner extending above the circle, then bend the extending inch of pipe cleaner in a hook shape. Finished.
Sometimes each player has grown up knowing a slightly different set of game play. Outline the basics before you start thinking and guessing.          What kind of categories does the questioner start with? Will you have to start or will the guesser ask?  Choose between the following: animal (it's alive and breathing), vegetable (it grows), and mineral (it's not alive and comes from the ground) or person, place, and thing. AVM can lead to technicalities (is a wooden table a vegetable or a mineral?) but PPT opens up the entire world (the Seattle Space Needle).   Does the object have to be in sight? In the room? Or anywhere? Will you allow a final guess as a sort of 21st question? Are answers strictly limited to yes/no, or do they include "sometimes," "usually," or "rarely?" Who's keeping track? Are you monitoring their questions or are they monitoring their own?  , It's best to go outside yourself a bit and think of an object neither party has on the brain. Pick an object that both parties are familiar with and is improbable but definitely not impossible.          Do not pick your younger sister's diary she hides under her bed. There is no way the guesser will ever get that. It's just not fun. If you're obsessed with Star Trek, don't choose Star Trek. If Garfield wants to fool Odie, he's not going to choose lasagna. Pick something your partner doesn't expect--especially if it's a friend who knows you well.  If you don't know the answer to a question, you may make a guess, but let them know you're not entirely sure. Don't lead them down the wrong path.          Don't think too much. If they ask you, "Is it bigger than a refrigerator?" don't reply, "Maybe? What size refrigerator are you referring to?" Think in standards. If you don't think too much, you'll stay on the same page.  On the 20th question (and remember: guesses count!), the game is over. If they haven't read your mind, you win! Time to fool them again.          If they did guess the object, hand them over the rights to be the questioner. Hopefully they'll be as nice to you as you were to them.	Go over the rules. Think of an object. Give accurate answers. Deem a winner.
The easiest way to do this is to turn on the hot wash cycle and interrupt it after the water has been filled. You could also heat up water in the kitchen and transfer it to the machine.  Turn the washing cycle on for a few seconds to let so that the agitation function mixes the bleach and the water, then turn it back off and let the chlorine mixture sit for at least an hour. This will start lifting the grime, mildew and other substances inside your washing machine.   If you'd prefer not to use bleach, you can use a special machine cleaner instead. These are available for purchase at grocery stores in the detergent aisle. For a natural alternative, add a quart of white vinegar instead of bleach or cleaner.  After an hour, let the machine complete the washing cycle. At this point the inside of the machine is sanitized.   If the machine smells like bleach once the cycle is complete, fill it with hot water and pour in a quart of vinegar. Let it sit for an hour, then run the washing cycle once more.  Use a vinegar water solution and a scrubber to clean the places where you insert powdered or liquid detergent. Dirt, hair, and other debris tends to pile up there, so cleaning these areas is an important part of keeping the inside clean, too.	Fill the machine with hot water. Add a quart of chlorine bleach. Finish the washing cycle. Clean the dispensers.
This can provide useful information for what caused the stain. Certain stains will need special cleaning procedures to be removed from the stone. Note the color, size, shape, and pattern of the stain, along with anything in the area that might have caused it., Some common examples of oil based stains include grease, tar, or cosmetics. These will cause your tile to darken. To dissolve oil based stains, clean the area by gently wiping it with a soft cloth and a household detergent, like dish soap, or ammonia. Afterwards, dry the area with a soft towel.   If detergent and ammonia fail to remove the stain, try mineral spirits or acetone. Use these sparingly and as a last resort. Flush these cleaners with water after applying, then dry the area., Mix a diluted cleaning solution containing a half cup (237 ml) of ammonia, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide with a gallon (3.8 L) of water. Clean the surface with the solution with a soft cloth, rinse the area well, then dry it with a soft cloth or towel.   Never mix bleach and ammonia. Doing so will create toxic fumes that can result in serious harm or death., The most common kinds of organic stains come from bodily fluids, like urine or feces, tobacco, paper, and food. These may create a brown-pink stain. Clean these areas as you would normally with 12% hydrogen peroxide and a couple of drops of ammonia.

The term "surety bond" is rather vague and doesn’t give the underwriter enough information to ascertain the type of bond that is right for you. That's why he will need a fully filled out application.  Underwriters will consider a range of factors when pre-qualifying an application. These considerations include an applicant’s character, collateral, creditworthiness and business experience, as well as business and personal financial information. Underwriters also examine an applicant’s capital, licensure, business structure, and financial stability in order to determine his/her ability to meet the bonded obligation.  Typically, your cost will be based on your credit score and financial stability. Increasing your credit score by paying your bills at the right time and keeping the balance on your credit cards below 30% of their limit will allow you to receive a lower rate on your loan for a surety bond. Your credit rating is important, because a surety bond is like a line of credit. Surety companies give better premium rates to applicants with good credit, because they consider them less of a risk.  If an underwriter cannot reach you, some of his questions may go unanswered. This can affect the price of your bond or can cause your bond to be denied.  By adding time to your bond, you can receive a discount on your premium. The rate of the bond will remain the same for the term of the bond. It may change at renewal. Paying the renewal premium will automatically renew your bond.	Apply online. Help the underwriter determine the kind of bond you need. Have assets. Get a low rate on your bond. Verify all your contact Information. Extend your bond for additional years.

Remember that you'll be drawing a human figure using basic shapes. This time, though, the figure is going to be thinner and taller than the average person.       ; , Notice how thin the figure is and how long the legs are compared to "normal" human drawing.  You don't need to add in too much detail on the face or hands. You're welcome to add hair if desired, but it's by no means necessary. Keep in mind that your drawing must serve the purpose of highlighting the clothes.  Think of the figure as a mannequin.  Ink or paint works the best. Wait a while before erasing the guidelines.

This will prolong the aesthetic beauty of your furniture, especially if you have a lot of wooden furniture. Water repellents help prevent water from soaking into your furniture, and they also quicken the evaporation of moisture from within the wood. This reduces the chance that your furniture will warp, weaken, or rot.   Keep in mind that stain and water repellents typically need to be reapplied every 2 to 3 years for maximum protection.

When applying, be sure to be in a well-ventilated area, and wear rubber gloves and a mask.  You'll want to avoid having furniture bumping into another piece of furniture or any other obstacles that might be in the way in order to avoid chipping the metal.

An LLC's operating agreement includes details about the roles and responsibilities of members, how decisions are made, how profits and losses are allocated, and how the business's structure can be changed.If your LLC has an operating agreement, it should have a clause dealing with changes in membership. If it does, you'll need to follow this procedure to add a member.   If you don't have an operating agreement, you should consider hiring an attorney to draft one for you. If you'd rather draft the document on your own, many states have fill-in-the-blank forms that you can tailor to fit the needs of your LLC.; , If you don't have an operating agreement, the law of the state where you registered your LLC has default rules that outline the proper procedure for adding a new member, and the documents that must be amended or filed by law.   For example, in Arizona an LLC can add a new member only if all members consent and if the new member is identified as a member in a written statement signed by all members identified in the original Articles of Organization., If you have a multi-member LLC, schedule a meeting with your partners to discuss the potential new member before you hold a vote. At the meeting, you'll want to demonstrate the qualifications, financial resources, and general business experience of the potential new member.   The other members may want to interview the member candidate, if they don't already know her, and ask her questions. After the interview, they probably will want to discuss and debate the advantages and disadvantages of bringing a new member on board. The existing members need to agree on the new member's capital interest, as well as how this effects the value of the capital investments made by the existing members. If the capital interests of existing members aren't updated when a new member is added, the new member could receive a disproportionate amount should the business be dissolved., State law typically requires a unanimous vote by all members to add a new member, unless the LLC's operating agreement provides for approval by less than unanimous consent.   When you sit down with the other members to vote, make sure you document in writing whether each member approves or disapproves of adding the new member.The meeting to vote on the new member should be called formally, with advanced notice given to all members., There are a number of sections of the Operating Agreement that need to be updated to account for your new member.   At a minimum, you will need to update the sections that cover the percentage interests of each member in the company, their capital contributions, the allocation of profits and losses, and voting power of all members.Since a new member acquires an interest in the company, the interests of existing members in profits, losses, and distributions will automatically be affected. Any clauses in the operating agreement dealing with members' economic interests will have to be changed., In some states, you also must amend your LLC's Articles of Organization to reflect the addition of a new member. For example, Arizona requires you to amend this document if a new member gains 20 percent or more of the percentage interests in the company, or if a new person acquires any member interest at all in a member-managed company.Your state law will have a deadline for any amendment to be filed following the event that prompted the amendment. For example, in Arizona you have 30 days from the day you add the new member to file your amendment with the state.You also will need to amend your articles of organization if you are changing your business management structure from a member-managed LLC to a manager-managed LLC, or vice versa., This contract outlines the interest you are transferring to the new member, and what the new member is investing in return for that interest.   This agreement is similar to a deed or bill of sale. The ownership interests in the LLC are being reconfigured, which ultimately means the standing members are selling a portion of their interest to the new member., If you have a multi-member LLC, a written resolution to add the new member should be signed by all members so there is record of everyone agreeing to the change in membership and membership interest., If you were required to amend your articles of organization, you must file the amendment with the Secretary of State or other agency in charge of business filings in your state.   Since operating agreements don't have to be filed with the state, you can amend the agreement without filing anything. However, some states give you the option to file your operating agreement. If you took advantage of this option, you should file your amendment as well.Check with your secretary of state's office to find out if you can file the amendments online or if you are required to file paper forms.You will have to pay a fee for filing an amendment, typically around $100. Check with the secretary of state or business filings agency in your state to find out the exact fees and what those fees include. If the fees don't include a certified copy, you need to find out how much that will cost so you can get at least one certified copy for your business records., The EIN is your LLC's tax number for federal and often state purposes. Generally, you need a new EIN if your LLC's ownership or structure changes.If you were operating as a single-member LLC and added a new member, you will need to get a new EIN.However, if you already had a multi-member LLC and you're simply adding a new member, you usually won't need to get a new EIN., If adding a new member resulted in a change in the way your LLC is classified, you must file this form to let the IRS know.Unless you make a different election using Form 8832, the IRS will classify your LLC according to the default rule. Multi-member LLCs are treated as partnerships for tax purposes by default. Therefore, if you wanted your LLC to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes, you would need to file Form 8832.Generally, as long as you have at least two members before you add the new member, the LLC's income tax status is not changed by adding a new member and there's no reason to notify the IRS., Sometimes when you add a member, you also change the name of the company.   For example, suppose you and your spouse ran "Sasquatch Ice Cream, LLC." Your son has recently graduated with a business degree and is eager to join the family business. When you add him as a member of your LLC, you want to change the name to "Sasquatch and Son Ice Cream, LLC." To do this, you would have to file documents with the state and with the IRS to register the name change. To change your name with the IRS, you need to send notice to the IRS at the address where you filed your return. This notice must be signed by a partner of your business.To change your name with your secretary of state, you'll need to fill out the appropriate business name change form and pay the required fee, which may be as much as $200.	Review your operating agreement. Check your state's LLC Act. Meet with the other members. Vote on adding the new member. Amend your Operating Agreement. Amend your Articles of Organization. Draft an Assignment of Membership Agreement. Draft a Resolution of Members. File the amendments with the Secretary of State. Determine if you need to get a new EIN. File the Entity Classification Election form with the IRS, if necessary. Register change in name with state and federal authorities, if necessary.

You can use an empty paper towel tube or an empty toilet paper tube for this. The longer paper towel tube will allow you to make several napkin rings at one time, however.The wax paper will prevent the glue from sticking to the cardboard tube, and allow you to slide your finished napkin ring off easily.   You can also cut a piece of wax paper longer than the cardboard tube, wrap it around the tube, and then tuck the ends inside it., Choose some burlap or lace ribbon that is the same width as what you want the napkin rings to be. Wrap it around your cardboard tube, add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and cut it.   If you absolutely cannot find burlap or lace ribbon, you can use regular or lace fabric instead. The edges will not be finished, however, and will give the napkin rings and even more rustic feel.  Overlap the two ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then stick a sewing pin straight into the cardboard tube, at the top and bottom of the seam., Use a foam brush to do this, and focus especially on the seam. Be sure that the Mod Podge or decoupage that you are using has a matte finish., This will take about 4 to 5 hours.If you are having troubles getting the tubes to stand upright, you can place them over a narrow salt or pepper shaker, the top of a long-necked bottle, or even a paper towel holder.  Pull off the rubber bands and remove the sewing pins. Slide the napkin rings off of the tube; don't worry if the wax paper comes with it. Carefully peel away the wax paper, if needed.   Do not get impatient with this step. The Mod Podge must be completely dry.  Thicker materials, such as burlap, might still be a little damp inside. If this is the case, stand the napkin rings up right, and let them finish drying.For extra support, you might want to brush on an extra layer of Mod Podge or decoupage glue over the outside and inside seam.  Once the napkin rings are completely dry, they are ready to use. You can also decorate them further, however. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Hot glue some small, silk or felt flowers to burlap napkin rings for a rustic/fall look.Hot glue a large jingle bell to a burlap napkin ring for a cozy cottage/winter look. Wrap some thin, jute string around the middle of lace napkin rings for a country-chic touch, and tie it into a bow.Hot glue a pastel-colored silk rose or peony to a lace napkin ring for a vintage look. You could also add some pearl beading to the edges.	Cover a cardboard tube with wax paper, and secure it at both ends with rubber bands. Cut the burlap or lace ribbon. Wrap the ribbon around the cardboard tube, and secure it with two sewing pins. Apply Mod Podge, or a similar decoupage glue, over the fabric until it is completely saturated. Stand the cardboard tubes upright, and wait for the glue to dry. Take the napkin rings off of the cardboard tubes. Let the napkin rings finish drying, if necessary. Decorate the napkin rings further, if desired.

They may be found in the cleaning products aisle. These reusable balls toss in the dryer along with your clothes and linens, fluffing them and enhancing drying to reduce your dryer's energy usage. Some dryer balls will contain baking soda to freshen the laundry.; , Put a half cup or so in an old, clean sock (a good use for those lonely ones), tie off, and toss into the dryer with laundry to freshen. This can be used through several loads and enhanced with 5 to 7 drops of essential oils of lemon, lavender (especially good for bed linens), sweet orange, or pine (for household goods like washable rugs). When used up, the sock can be opened, emptied into the compost, and refilled several times.  The ball can be used over and over.  This is especially useful for natural fibers. Diluted vinegar is slightly acidic, which closes the cuticle of the fiber, making it smoother.	Look for dryer balls at dollar stores, drugstores, grocery stores, or health food stores. Gather or buy lavender buds and/or dried lemon or orange rinds (available at farmers markets, tea and herb shops, and bulk stores). Scrunch up a ball of aluminum foil to toss in with laundry to reduce static buildup. Distilled vinegar can be added to your washer's rinse cycle to soften fabrics.
Cleaning means different things to different people. You’re going to have to identify, first, exactly what you want to do. When deciding on your goal, think of the audience. Do you just want it to be clean for yourself, or for guests? Also, the level of “clean” will necessarily be restricted by the amount of time you devote, so keep that in mind. There are a few different possibilities:   You want the room to “look” clean to others. This might be the quickest option, as you'll just be creating the illusion of a clean and organized room. It might include just moving around clutter and wiping down furniture and be doable in under 30 minutes. You want the room to be organized. This is a moderate option that could take up to an hour, depending on how much stuff is cluttering the room and needs to be put away. You want the room to be organized and to be free of dirt, grime, and smells. This could take up to 2 hours, depending on a variety of factors. There are also varying levels between the above options.; , You’re going to have to set aside a certain amount of time to achieve your goal. One of the largest determinants of how much time you set aside will be your end goal. But before you come up with an amount of time, you need to ask yourself a few questions:   How much time do you have? How large is the mess? What is your definition of “quick”?  , Take a few steps to make sure that you’re undisturbed so that you can devote all of your energy to cleaning. After all, you won’t be able to get much done if you’re constantly talking to people, answering the phone, or doing other activities. In addition, you can take a few steps to further motivate yourself. Consider the following:   Turn off your cell phone. Turn off your computer. Tell your parents, siblings, or roommates that you’re going to be busy for a little while. Put on some music that gets you pumped up., Spend perhaps five minutes taking a look at the mess that you’re about to clean up. When doing this, you need to create a list, either mental or on paper, of the biggest obstacles to your cleaning. After doing this, you should be somewhat more prepared to jump right in. Consider the following.   Is clutter a major obstacle? Do you have knick-knacks, old toys, books, and electronics covering all of your surfaces? Is dirt and grime your major problem? Is unsorted laundry or shoes your major problem?, If you've answered the above questions, then you can begin to prioritize your tasks. You'll know where to start, and where to spend the most time.   If you want to create the appearance of a clean room, spend your time moving or hiding clutter and wiping down furniture. If you want a truly organized room, allocate time to organization rather than to things like dusting the fan. If you want a clean and organized room and are crunched for time, consider devoting a third of your time to organization and the remaining two thirds to cleaning. If you're left with unorganized items, relocate them and tackle that problem later.  Start off by clearing your floor of anything that shouldn’t be there. This way, you’ll start the process of sorting loose items, and getting rid of dirt and grim. After doing this, you should feel a sense of accomplishment and be well on the way to having a clean and more orderly room.   Take any loose clothes and shoes and make a pile on the floor. Chances are, these are already dirty. If they’re clean, relocate them to somewhere else. Move out chairs and other small pieces of portable furniture into a neighboring room or hallway, this way, you’ll be able to vacuum easier when the time comes Get a trash bag and throw any garbage or loose pieces of paper into it. Make a “miscellaneous” pile on the floor, on a chair, or on a couch., Take a look at your desk, bookshelves, and other pieces of large furniture. Remove any items that don’t belong there, and put them in the appropriate pile (trash, miscellaneous, or clothing).   Haul any dishes to the kitchen. Throw trash into the trash bag. Put clothes or shoes in the clothes and shoes pile. Put misc. items in the misc. pile., Now you’ve got a clear floor and your furniture should be clear, too. Take the opportunity to start sorting through and organizing your three piles. Depending on how much time you have, and what your goals are, you can spend more time on this or spend less time on it.   If spending less time, find some hampers or garbage bags, and put your clothes and shoes in there – for later sorting (wink, wink). If spending more time, go through your clothing pile, bring dirty clothes to the laundry room and hang up or fold clean clothes. If spending less time, find some cardboard boxes and dump your misc. pile into them – relocate them to the garage or another room temporarily (wink, wink). If spending more time, go through your misc. pile and put all the items in appropriate location. Books go on a book shelf, video games go next to the game system, DVDs go on a DVD rack or next to the DVD player., If you’ve got a kitchen table, TV trays, or a counter where you eat, or anything like that, you need to get a rag and some soap, depending on the surface, and wipe it clean. Most surfaces will clean with a wet rag, but sometimes you’ll need to bring in the big guns. But remember:   Use appropriate chemicals for appropriate surfaces. You don’t want to ruin hardwood furniture with abrasive chemicals. Try to use a microfiber towel when you can. Stick to water and a little soap when and where you can., Dusting will give your room a much cleaner appearance, and help improve the air quality. It is one of the most important elements of keeping a clean house. Depending on how much time you have, you can choose the extent in which you will dust. Consider:   Use microfiber towels when you can. Dusting the surfaces of furniture, like desks, a TV stand, bookshelves, and more. Dust ceiling fans. Dust and remove cobwebs from crown molding. Wipe down the surfaces of electronics with microfiber towels., Now that your surfaces are clean and better organized and your floor is clear, it’s time to vacuum. Vacuuming will help remove dirty, dust, and dog or cat hair from the room. It is an essential part of any clean. Most rooms can be vacuumed in under five minutes, if you’re in a hurry.   Start at the back of the room and systematically move toward the entrance. Make sure to vacuum along the baseboards, behind and under couches and other furniture. Vacuum couches, chairs, and loveseats if appropriate. Be careful though, try to avoid damaging delicate fabrics. If you’re going to spend a little bit more time, try to vacuum over an area 3 or 4 times., Mopping is essential in removing dirty and grime from your floor, and all you need is some soap and a bucket. This is a must, so you won’t want to skip it. But, if you’re in a hurry, there are a few ways to save time:   If you want to save time, invest in a swifter or something similar. Another way to save time is to get a wet soapy towel, and to walk around the room with it. This won’t be as effective as actual mopping, but you’ll be able to pick up a lot of dirt and grime and save time. If mopping the old fashion way, make sure to sweep the floor first. Sweep from the back of the room toward the entrance, working systematically, and picking up your dirt/debris piles as you move toward the entrance.After sweeping, start mopping from the back of the room toward the front. Mop 3x3 or 4x4 foot sections and then rinse your mop with fresh water. Slowly and systematically move toward the entrance of the room.  After you've mopped, make sure to take a good look around the room and make some final adjustments if you need to. This is your chance to spend a couple minutes getting to the little things you might have neglected because you were in a hurry. Also, there are some finishing touches that will help your room look and smell clean:   Open the windows to let fresh air in. Turn on the fan, this will help the floor dry and will spread the clean air from outside around your home. Consider lighting a candle. If you're confident in how clean the room is, open the blinds and let some more light in.	Identify your goal in cleaning a room. Set aside a certain amount of time. Prevent interruptions and motivate yourself. Survey the landscape, quickly. Prioritize your tasks. Clear the floor. Sort items on your furniture. Organize your piles. Clean surfaces of hard-to-remove dirt and grime. Dust the room. Vacuum the room, if you’ve got carpet or if you want to vacuum your tile/hardwood. Mop the room, if you’ve got tile or hardwood. Look around the room.
Perhaps you can find someone who has something you need, and you can arrange a trade. Newspapers and some online websites often have an area set aside for trades. You list what you have to trade and what you need while checking out the ads placed by others.   You can also offer to clean out a basement, garage or storage building in return for the contents of the area. This is often an excellent resource for free flooring materials such as carpeting or area rugs and lighting fixtures.	Look around your home for items you no longer need.
Buy roughly 13 mm (½ inch) diameter PVC piping from a home improvement store. Cut the pipe into sections, as long as you'd like your rockets to be. 7.5–10 cm (3–4 in) rockets are a good place to start.   Do not replace this with a metal pipe. Sparks from the metal could ignite your rocket and cause a premature explosion.; , Find a smaller PVC pipe, that just barely fits into your rocket sections. Cut this into short sections, about 6–12 mm (¼–½ in) long. Cut through each section — this allows you to expand the ring outward for a tighter fit. Apply PVC cement to the inner edge of the larger pipe, at one end. Place the smaller pipe inside the larger one, pressing it outward to form a tight fit. Repeat on the opposite end with a second retaining ring. Clamp and wait for the cement to cure, according to label instructions., Purchase unscented clay cat litter from a pet store. Keeping it dry, grind it in a coffee grinder or mortar until it becomes fine dust.   Alternatively, use quick-set cement. Eventually, you'll be making a cap on the opposite end as well. Grind extra and set it aside.  Stand each pipe on its end on a stable surface. Fill each one about ⅓ full with the cat litter dust. Tamp the litter vigorously with a wooden dowel or spool that fits snugly into the pipe. This should compress the litter into a hard, clay cap.   Make sure the clay forms a hard surface above the retaining ring. The ring's job is to prevent the clay from sliding out, allowing the rocket to build up more pressure before the cap blows out. If the litter crumbles and refuses to pack, dampen it slightly.  Sugar provides the energy that will give thrust to the rocket once burned. Check the ingredients list before buying: most powdered sugar contains a little corn starch, but this will not significantly affect the rocket.If it contains any other additives, look for a different brand.   In some areas, this is sold as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar. You can start with granulated white sugar and turn it into powdered sugar with a blender, coffee grinder, or spice mill.  This chemical, KNO3, will provide oxygen to allow for fast, prolonged combustion. Buy this as "stump killer" at a garden supply store or home improvement store. Some brands of stump killer contain other ingredients, so check the label to make sure it is 100% KNO3.   You can sometimes find potassium nitrate at pharmacies, farming supply stores, or online chemistry supply stores. For best results, look for it in powdered form. Keep the potassium nitrate and the sugar in separate rooms.  Buy a new coffee grinder and label it "potassium nitrate." Place it on a cleared counter, far away from all sugar and combustible materials. Fill halfway with potassium nitrate and grind for about 40 seconds, rotating the grinder to make sure all the powder hits the blades.The finer the powder, the more evenly it will mix with the sugar.   Never grind sugar and potassium nitrate in the same grinder, even in separate batches. This can cause a fire or explosion. You'll need 65g (2.3 oz) for this batch, about a handful.  Once made, the rockets are at risk of combustion if they come into contact with heat, a spark from a metal object, or a flame. Ideally, you should make the rockets close to the area you plan to set them off. Choose an open area with no passersby. Even when intentionally set off, these rockets can damage surroundings or people when they return to earth.   Check local law for regulations concerning rockets or fireworks.  Soon, you'll be mixing the two ingredients together over heat. There's always the risk of explosion or fire during this process. Reduce the chance of injury with the following setup:   Remove all clutter and flammable materials from a spacious area, preferably outside. The floor should be made of dirt (with all weeds removed) or concrete. Set up an electric hot plate or deep fryer with a thermostat control. An electric stove or other heating element without an exact temperature setting adds significant danger.Make sure there are no sources of sparks or open flame in the area. Even metal objects can be dangerous. Keep a large container of water nearby. A fire extinguisher may not extinguish burning propellant., There's a significant chance that the propellant mixture catches fire and explodes violently. Wear gloves, a face shield, and thick clothing that covers all exposed skin. Do not wear any clothing made from synthetic materials, which can melt onto your skin.   Use a face shield that protects your head and hair as well. A leather apron and long leather gloves are recommended.  Using a kitchen scale, measure 65 grams (2.29 ounces) powdered potassium nitrate, and bring it to your heating station. Bring the kitchen scale to the powdered sugar. Measure 35 grams (1.23 ounces) powdered sugar in a new container and bring that to your station. Pour both ingredients into a saucepan or frying pan that you don't plan on using for any other purpose.   For best results, make a double boiler by placing a deep saucepan into a larger pan filled with oil. This heats the propellant more evenly.For your first project, consider using 60g (2.12 oz) potassium nitrate and 40g (1.41 oz) sugar instead. This is much easier to make, but less powerful., This will slow down the firing, which decreases thrust but reduces risk of exploding the rocket prematurely. Mix 15g (0.53 oz) baking soda into your 100g (3.5 oz) of propellant. Use a wooden or silicone implement to stir.  Place the container of sugar and potassium nitrate on the electric heat source. Heat at 193ºC (380ºF), staying as near to this temperature as you can the whole time.Using a silicone spatula (never a metal one), stir gently to combine the two ingredients and distribute the heat. Failure to stir frequently can cause an explosion. Stir over heat until the whole mixture turns into a thick, light brown paste, similar to peanut butter. This can take up to an hour, but a batch this size will usually be ready in 20–30 minutes.   If the sugar turns dark brown, remove the mixture from heat. Too much caramelization will make the propellant less effective.  As soon as the hot propellant mixture is ready, pour a little into one of your prepared rockets. Immediately tamp it down with a snug-fitting dowel, making sure there are no air bubbles. Pour more propellant and tamp down until there's roughly 2.5 cm (1 inch) of space left in the tube.If the mixture has cooled too much to pour, transfer the material with a wooden implement. Leave space between the propellant and the retaining ring.  Create a second clay cap on top of the propellant, just as you did the first. Tamp down firmly to create a hard, non-crumbling cap. This should extend beneath the retaining ring and lie even with the end of the rocket.   Again, you may use quick-set cement instead. Allow cement to cure before you continue. At this point, the rocket will move with extreme force if the propellant ignites. Stand back while tamping. From now on, treat the rocket with extreme caution and avoid pointing either end toward yourself.  It's time to turn the cap you just made into a nozzle, which will create thrust by expelling high-pressure exhaust. It is possible to ignite the rocket by drilling, so use extreme caution. In your fire-safe work area, drill the nozzle as follows:   Clamp your rocket in place and stand to one side. Never put your face in front of the rocket end. Choose a small drill bit, to make a small hole in the center of the rocket. A smaller hole leads to higher pressure, but this may blow off the cap prematurely. You may need to experiment to find the best results. Use the slowest drill setting to keep temperatures low. Drill through the center of the clay cap. Stop every few seconds and withdraw to reduce heat and wipe off stuck particles with a dry cloth. Drill until you penetrate the top cap.  After you've penetrated the cap, you may wish to create a hollow core in the propellant. This will increase thrust by providing more surface area to combust.Push a dowel or aluminum rod into the propellant, pushing about halfway along the rocket's length.   Your propellant may be too viscous or too hard to create the core. That's fine; the rocket will still work. Remember, do not put your face in front of either end of the rocket.  Thread a cannon fuse into the hole you just drilled. Leave plenty of fuse outside the rocket for safety.  Tape or glue a long, sturdy, wooden skewer to the outside of the rocket. Attach it near the nozzle, with most of the skewer extending beyond it.   You should be able to balance the rocket (just above the ground) on a finger placed just above the nozzle. Move the stick or switch to a stick of a different size until you can balance it., Plant the stick firmly into the ground so the rocket points upward. Confirm that the stick and rocket are stable. Warn everyone in the area. Light the fuse and step well back. Congratulations! You've launched your first sugar rocket.   Preferably, move behind a safety wall after lighting the fuse.	Cut short sections of PVC piping. Add a retaining ring to each side. Grind cat litter. Pack the litter into each rocket. Purchase powdered sugar. Find potassium nitrate. Grind the potassium nitrate to a powder. Find an appropriate work area. Set up an electric heating station. Wear safety equipment. Add ingredients to a heat-safe container. Mix with baking soda (optional). Heat while stirring frequently. Pack the propellant into the rocket body. Tamp down additional cat litter. Drill carefully and slowly through the top cap. Create a core (optional). Attach a fuse. Attach a stick to the side. Set in the ground and light.
Unless you crack the scratch-off code or are extraordinarily fortunate, the possibility that you will make money playing lottery tickets is remote at best. By playing less often, you lose less often, meaning that when you occasionally do win you are likely closer to breaking even.   Cautionary tales abound of people who sink thousands of dollars into buying scratch-offs, hoping to strike it rich, instead of saving or investing that money.If you think of scratch-offs as a fun diversion and assume that the money you spend on tickets will be lost, you will almost certainly end up better off in the end.  Despite the tips provided in this article, there is only so much you can do to even slightly improve your odds of winning on scratch-offs. Simply buying more tickets won't help very much, and will more than likely just lose you more money.   Will buying ten tickets for $10 and getting two, $2 winners be that much less enjoyable than buying fifty tickets and getting ten winners? In one case, you’ve lost $6; in the other, you’ve lost $30. Enjoy the fun of playing in moderation, and you will probably be happier in the end.  The lure of a winning ticket can be strong, and can overwhelm even the best of intentions to stick to a scratch-off budget.   When you go to buy tickets, try taking only as much cash as you need to buy your predetermined number of scratch-offs. Also, don’t scratch the tickets until you get home, so you won’t be tempted to immediately cash in your winner for more tickets.  It is tempting to think of any winnings as “found money” that should be folded back into buying more scratch-offs, but this strategy is most likely simply to turn it into “wasted money.”   The best idea is probably to never reinvest your winnings in new tickets. Stick to your budget for ticket-buying whether you win or lose. If you can’t help but try to extend the thrill of winning, however, limit yourself to using half of your winnings to buy new tickets. Sock the rest away for another time and another purpose., Playing scratch-offs can be fun, but it can also become an obsession for some people. Lotteries are gambling, and gambling can be an addiction. If you feel like you’ve lost control, or know someone else who has, there many organizations that can help.	Play less often. Buy fewer tickets. Stick to your budget. Be wise with your winnings. Get help if you need it.
In the United States, the default relationship is “at-will” employment. In “at will” employment, the employer can fire the employee for any reason or no reason at all. Limitations on the “at will” doctrine are created by employment contracts, anti-discrimination law, and certain public policies.The only state that does not have “at will” employment is Montana.; , Try to find sample contracts in your field and analyze what terms are generally offered employees. An employment contract is an agreement between the employer and the employee. You should see how other employers define the employment terms in their contracts.   Look especially at whether the contract states that employment is “at will” or whether it list grounds for dismissal (“cause”). Common definitions of “cause” include fraud, theft, or embezzlement; willful misconduct that harms a company’s reputation, products, services, or customers; intentional violation of any law; continued failure to perform duties; unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets; being charged with a felony or misdemeanor.You can try to find sample employment contracts online. If you can’t find any, then you may want to consult with an employment attorney who specializes in your field.  Federal law prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, color, age, religion, national origin, or disability.It is not illegal under federal law to fire someone for sexual orientation (unless the person works for the federal government).However, it is illegal to use sex stereotyping to fire employees. Accordingly, firing a gay male for being “too feminine” or “girly” would violate federal law.Be aware that “gender” encompasses pregnancy under federal law. Accordingly, an employer discriminates against a woman by firing her because she is pregnant.It is illegal to for an employer to discriminate against someone who is over 40 years old because of their age.An employee may also have a claim against an employer for wrongful discharge if the employee reported the employer’s illegal discrimination and the employer retaliated against the employee. In a retaliation case, the employee does not have to belong to a protected category.  State laws may offer employees broader protection than federal law. For example, although federal law does not prohibit discrimination on sexual orientation, about half of all states do.The United States Department of Labor website also contains links to applicable state law. It is available here.  Get a good understanding of environmental, zoning, and other laws that relate to your business. It is against public policy in most states to require an employee to violate the law in the course of her employment.   If, for some reason, you terminated an employee for refusal to break the law, then you could face a wrongful termination suit in most states. It is also against public policy to fire someone for exercising a right, such as the right to vote., Before offering an employee a contract, you should carefully review your contract and tailor it to job requirements. Do not simply recycle an old employment contract. Also do not simply use a form or template contract.   You can always have a lawyer look at the contract and recommend changes.  Employers should carefully scrutinize any handbooks or manuals that they distribute to employees. If these materials create sufficiently definite promises (e.g., of vacation time, length of guaranteed employment, pay raises, etc.) then they can form the basis of a contract with the employee.   Remove anything from the manuals or handbooks that sounds like a promise or that deviates from your written contract. Oral promises can also form the basis of a breach of contract complaint.You should avoid making verbal promises of pay raises, promotions, or increased vacation time until such a time that you can put them in writing. Also, memorialize your company’s commitment to adhere to anti-discrimination laws in your handbook and explain the process of lodging a complaint without fear of retaliation.Including this information in a widely-distributed handbook or manual can decrease your chances of being held liable for discrimination or retaliation., You can minimize the likelihood of lawsuits if you train your supervisors in the basics of harassment, discrimination, retaliation, safety, and employee privacy.Employers have “vicarious liability” for any harassment done by supervisors. This means that the company itself will also be liable for harassment.It is therefore important to take seriously complaints about harassment by supervisors.  One way to protect yourself from discrimination and retaliation claims is to create a standardized termination protocol, which will apply across the business. It should be published in your employee handbook and discussed with all supervisors. Elements of an effective termination protocol include:   Progressive discipline procedures. Outline what events should trigger a written warning and explain how those warnings should be preserved in the employee file.Also explain any hierarchy of discipline. For example: verbal warning, written reprimand, discharge. Internal grievance or dispute systems. Employees may follow up a reprimand by filing a grievance. Tell employees the proper procedure for filing a complaint, and explain how the complaint will be reviewed.  The purpose of an annual review is to review the employee’s performance and to suggest areas of improvement. At the same time, it is a critical means of documenting inferior performance, which may be useful should you need to support a termination decision at a later date. Remember, the burden will always be on the employer to justify a termination.Accordingly, annual review forms should include spaces to judge the following (which are common reasons for termination):poor performance refusal to follow directions abusing sick leave excessive absence and habitual tardiness violation of company rules dishonesty endangering the health or safety of others or behaving violently at work disclosing confidential information to outsiders  , When you perform an annual review, or whenever you reprimand an employee, be sure that it is in writing and that the employee signs the reprimand. This signature serves as proof that you notified the employee of his subpar performance.Also consider an “annual written acknowledgement” in which the employee signs a letter stating that she has received an updated manual, that employment is “at will” (if it is), and that she has not been subjected to harassment or discrimination.The acknowledgement can address any other issue, such as the employee’s amount of accumulated overtime or leave. An example can be found here. You cannot force employees to sign it. However, you should state that if the employee disagrees with anything stated in the letter, then he should tell his employer.This protects the employer in two ways. First, the employee may well sign it. Second, if he refuses to sign, he has to alert management of any possible discrimination or harassment claims he may have.  If you learn of misconduct by one employee against another, then you should investigate the misconduct. Doing so will protect you from legal liability.   Involve your attorney early as well.Involving the attorney not only shows that you take the complaint seriously, but you also will receive sound legal advice for how to handle the investigation to minimize your liability.  Rather than allow a direct supervisor to immediately fire someone, an independent review affords management the opportunity to make sure the company has complied with the law. You should ensure:that the firing would not violate anti-discrimination laws or other statutes. that the firing would not breach an employee’s contract. that the company has given the employee adequate and documented warnings (unless the conduct warrants immediate firing). that the company has followed any stated company practices. that the company has followed the same procedures in similar situations involving other employees.  Gather whatever documentation you can that supports the reason for termination and read it. Documentation can be annual evaluations, comments, or citations placed in an employee file, as well as written statements by other employees. Be prepared to discuss the quality of employees’ work when you terminate them.You need documentation that would be admissible in court. If you have had employee complaints, it is important to get those complaints reduced to writing before the termination decision. If you wait until after a wrongful termination suit is filed, then it looks as if you are manufacturing complaints against the employee simply to protect yourself.  An experienced employment attorney can help you at every stage of the employer-employee relationship. Ideally, you would have sought the assistance of an attorney when devising internal procedures and when drafting employment contracts. If not, an attorney can still help answer any questions you have about firing an employee.   Common situations in which employers seek out an attorney’s advice include: the employee has a written contract, the employee recently filed a complaint with a government agency (like the EEOC), the employee has access to trade secrets, or when firing the employee would dramatically change your workplace’s demographics., You can reduce the chances of being sued simply out of spite if you extend some assistance to an employee you are terminating.Offer the employee a chance to resign. This will allow an employee to save face and perhaps also mitigates any anger or bitterness. Nevertheless, be aware that an employee resigning does not preclude a wrongful termination suit. Volunteer to provide a positive reference. Let an employee know that you would be willing to give a favorable a reference. While not always possible, this may be an option for an employee who simply wasn’t a good fit for your company. Provide job search assistance. If you must fire employees for a “fit” reason instead of for misconduct, then you may be able to help them find their next job. Notify them of any openings and provide leads.	Understand the basics of “at will” employment. Read sample employment contracts. Learn federal anti-discrimination law. Read state employment law. Understand non-employment laws that apply to your business. Tailor employee contracts. Review manuals and handbooks. Train supervisors. Establish termination protocols. Create a useful annual review form. Require employee acknowledgment of reviews. Investigate internal complaints promptly. Consider an independent review. Gather documentation. Consult with an attorney. Extend assistance to the employee.
Before using the mosaic cutter, suit up with safety gear.   Place ceramic plates inside an old towel or pillowcase. Hit plates with a hammer, several times until you’ve created the piece sizes you desire. Remove plate pieces and repeat until you have enough to integrate into your stepping stones.; , Place the pan on top of the contact paper and trace around it.   Cut out tracing and remove adhesive backing. Place contact paper inside cake pan, sticky side facing upward.  Arrange the pieces in a decorative manner. You want to press the pieces firmly into the sticky contact paper.   Allow enough room between pieces so that the cement seeps in between. Check the design by removing the decorated contact paper and hold it up to the light. If you like the way it looks, replace the paper, sticky side upward in the cake pan.  Mix concrete outside and be sure you protect your face with the mask and hands with the gloves.   Follow the directions on the concrete package to mix it to the right consistency.  Cut a square piece of chicken wire that will hold your stones in place. The wire should be smaller than the stone size but large enough to provide traction.   Put wire aside.  Fill pan approximately ¾ of the way, using your knife to spread the concrete evenly.   Press concrete down into the pan to ensure a dense stone. Place chicken wire on top of the concrete, pressing into place. Top with more cement so it fills the entire pan. Smooth with hands and/or knife.  Make sure you leave it in a cool, non-humid area to ensure it dries completely.  Turn pan over and tap the top to loosen the stone. Once the stone has been released, slowly remove the contact paper.   Sand rough edges and then use a wet cloth to smooth and clean the stone.	Cut plates and glass into chunks. Prepare cake pan to receive concrete and ceramic pieces/sea glass. Decorate pan with ceramic pieces and decorative glass. Mix concrete. Create the stepping stone support. Spread concrete in cake pan, on top of the decorative gems and ceramic pieces. Allow pan to sit and dry for approximately 2 days. Remove from pan. Finish stepping stone by covering it with marine varnish or a protective varnish coating.
Use scissors to cut a straight line from end to end on one of your toilet paper rolls. Then use hot glue to attach a sturdy paper straw or wooden dowel to the center of your bottle cap. Allow the glue to dry.  Open your slit toilet paper roll and position the lid so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll, with the straw/dowel exiting the other end of the roll. Then:   Try to insert this roll, along with the cap and straw, into the uncut roll. It should be snug, but you should still be able to push the cut roll inside the uncut one. Use your hot glue to attach the bottle cap and attached straw inside the cut roll. Position the bottle cap so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll. The straw should exit the opposite end., Cover the outside of your uncut roll with decorative paper to cover the plain cardboard. Attach the paper with either a glue stick or tape. Once the glue is dry, use your glue stick or tape to attach a taut layer of tissue paper at one end of the roll., Hold your uncut roll so the tissue paper covered end is upside down. Add confetti to this roll, then gently insert the confetti pusher into the open end of the uncut roll until it is ¼ to ½ of the way inside.   You may need to wiggle the pusher back and forth to position it properly inside the uncut roll. Be careful not to use too much force, as it could break your tissue paper seal and release the confetti., When the moment comes for you to launch the confetti, in a rapid motion, pull back on the straw/dowel of the confetti pusher slightly, then push it forward firmly. This should cause the tissue paper to break and confetti to fly out of the popper.	Cut a straight line from end to end on a toilet paper roll. Check the size of the confetti pusher and assemble it.

Remember, you have to pay attention to three separate rules when inputting numbers, but this is to your advantage. Very few numbers satisfy all three conditions, and this is where your solution comes from:   Only one of each number in each horizontal row. Only one of each number in each vertical column. The answer of each cage matches the number and mathematical symbol in the upper left corner., Take all of the basic boxes without mathematical symbols first, like "2," or "9" and simply fill in the number. If the box just says two, put in a two. This will take care of the basics and start to reveal other answers., This will depend on the size of the board, but you'll still find them easily with some practice. For example, imagine a 4x4 puzzle. Take a two box cage for "3-." Knowing that you only have 1, 2, 3, and 4 to choose from, you know that there is only one pair that subtracts to three, 4 and 1. While you might not know the order, you do know these are the only two numbers in this row. Make a note of them for later. Every Kenken has some of these "easy" boxes to get you started, such as:   Multiplication/division by grid size and odd numbers usually only has a few answers. Examples include "4x" in a 4x4 grid (1 & 4), "15x" in a 6x6 grid (3 & 5), etc. Two-box addition cages, usually for 3+ or 4+ (can only use 1, 2, and 3)., There are a lot of places where two numbers will equally plausible, as you don't know enough about the rest of the board to figure out which number is correct. Write small notes in the upper right corner of the box, allowing you to see which numbers could be in each place, and which numbers have to be there. For example:In the previous step, you noted that you need a 4 and a 1 to make 3-, but you didn't know what order. But if the same row as the top box already contains a 4, then suddenly it's all clear. The 1 goes on top, and the 4 goes below, making your "3-."  , For example, imagine a vertical row that already contains a 4 and a blank in the top boxes. The bottom two boxes are a cage for "3+," which can only be created with a 1 and a 2. This means the second box must be a 3, even though you don't know what order the 1 and 2 are. The finished cage would look like this:   4 3 1 or 2 1 or 2	Always check all three sets of clues before putting in a number. Fill in blank single boxes first. Find and mark the boxes that only have one potential answer. Write smaller numbers in the upper right corner to take notes, crossing them off as they are eliminated. Use groupings of potential numbers to fill in the areas you're unsure of.
Place drop cloths on the floor to catch dust and tile pieces.; , You should use safety goggles, long shirts, long pants and gloves. Broken tile can be sharp and dangerous.  It is inadvisable to try to tile over old tile, because your surface will not be even.   Use a chisel and a hammer to crack existing tiles. Once cracked, remove the tile in pieces, if it does not fall off automatically. Chisel off remaining pieces. Beware not to gouge the wall too deeply, or you may create an uneven surface. If the resulting wall is very uneven, you may want to re-plaster it. It is best to hire a professional to plaster the walls. If you are installing wall tile in a bathroom or other wet area, use cement fiberboard on the surface before you adhere tile.  If you are not removing previous tile, you will still want to scuff up glossy surfaces with a fine-grit sandpaper to help the adhesive stick.  Porcelain tiles are available through the Internet, home improvement stores and decorators. Buy extra tile for your project, since tiles will break in the process.   Take your tile to the home improvement store to try out glue. Different ceramic tiles require different types of glue. You do not want your glue to discolor the tile.

Basic Equation of a Balance Sheet: Asset = Liability + Equity   Asset = Remember that asset adds worth to a business. You look at how well it manages its asset by checking the financial value allocated to cash, receivables, short-term and long-term investments, inventory, fixed assets, furniture and fixtures, land and building. By doing so, you can determine if a business is able to sustain and grow operation or it will close down. Liability = Take note that liability consists all the outstanding loan obligations of a business. Obtaining loans is one of the ways to generate capital to support a business operation. Liability account will enable you to look at the balances of the accounts payables, bills payables, notes payables and all other payables. Most often, depending on a given situation, when you see that a business have high amount of liability, it may be a sign of trouble and inability to sustain its operation. Equity = Equity meant to be the capital of a business. It is the major source of money to support and sustain a business operation. When you look at the equity account, check the number of stocks, common and preferred, that were issued. In the equity account, you will be able to see the real value of a business in terms of ownership . When you see a high equity balance, it can be a good indicator that the business is able to sustain and grow. The opposite means it is in trouble of closing down its operation.; , Basically, it comprises of the following:   Revenue = This account will show you the amount of sales derived in a given period. It may come from the service fees or sales price of goods sold, depending on the type of business being run. Take note that when a business have a high amount of revenue, it indicates good marketing and sales process that resulted to high sales volume of product or service. However, beware for it doesn't necessarily mean the business is profitable. Expenses = Signify the amount of cost to produce an item sold. It includes cost of the materials used, cost of the service rendered, interest expense, depreciation, bad debts expenses, etc. When you verify expenses account, you can check if the business is spending on improving its product, investing a lot of money on marketing (like advertisement), gives high salary and benefits to employee, or just plainly wasting money. Profit(Loss) Before Tax = Remember that revenue alone doesn't necessarily means the business is profitable. Because of the expense account, even if the business has high revenue, if it spends just the same level, it wouldn't be as profitable as it should be. Here are the guidelines to know if a business is profitable or not: Profit means the amount of sales was higher than the amount of cost to produce (Revenue > Expense). When there’s profit, it means the operation of the business was doing good. On the other hand,Loss means the amount of sales was lower than the cost to produce (Revenue < Expense). When there’s loss, it means the operation of the business was doing bad. Income Tax = the amount of obligation the business have to pay to the government. In determining the income tax, check the country in which the business operates because Income tax is derived by the tax rate given by a particular country multiplied against the Profit Before Tax. Profit(Loss) After Tax = Finally, once you determined the income tax to be paid, you'll be able to compute for the real amount of profit or loss after deducting the applicable amount of tax.  There are two types of Cash Flow Statement, an indirect method and direct method.   Direct Method = presents you a condensed cash receipts and cash disbursements statement. Indirect Method = presents you cash movements by adjusting net income for items that affected reported net income but didn't affected cash.  You will be able to verify in detail the total ownership of a business, like how many stocks it is allowed to issue and how many it was actually able to sell. The movement you will see in this report includes, common stock, preferred stocks, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings.  It will explain to you the standards that were used to measure each account in the previous four financial statements, the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and stockholder’s equity. Also, you will be able to check the future plans and operations of a business.	Use the balance sheet to review the financial condition of a business, as of a given period, by looking at how it manages its Asset, Liabilities and Equity. Review the income statement report to understand the overall performance, profit or loss, of a business in a given period. Use the Cash Flow Statement to understand the movement of cash in a given period. Check the Statement of Stockholder’s Equity to get the details on the movement of the equity account discussed in the balance sheet above. Look at the Notes to the Financial Statement to read the narrative explanation of the whole financial statement.
If the label is too difficult to peel off, soak the jar in warm, soapy water for 10 minutes, then peel the label off. You will have some residue, but that is fine.Avoid using nail polish remover or acetone if your jar is made from plastic. They may distort or discolor the jar. Rubbing alcohol may be safely substituted but it may not be very effective.  If there is a lot of residue, stick with a scrubby sponge. Acetone will also work for this method. Rubbing alcohol may work, but it will not be as effective as nail polish remover or acetone; it is best reserved for light residue.  The chemicals in the nail polish remover or acetone will dissolve any glue and make it easier to scrub off. You may have to reapply the nail polish remover or acetone.  This is especially necessary if you plan on using your jar for food storage. Once the jar is clean, pat it dry with a clean towel and use it for your project.	Remove as much of the label as possible first. Pour some nail polish remover onto a paper towel, cloth, or scrubby sponge.If the residue is only minimal, you can use a paper towel. Scrub the residue with it using small, circular motions. Wash the jar using warm, soapy water.
In the United States, no federal law requires that retail businesses provide patrons with bathroom access. However, your state or local law can fill in the gap and require public access.You should research your state and local laws to find out if your business is subject to this requirement.   Meet with your commercial code enforcement official and ask about whether your local code requires public restrooms. Many plumbing codes do require public access, although business owners are usually unaware of this requirement.You should research your state law. Search online for “your state” and “public access bathroom.” If you can’t find anything online, then you might want to visit your nearest law library. It may be at your local courthouse or at a nearby law school.; , Local and state regulations may be difficult to understand. If so, you should schedule a consultation with a business attorney who can advise you about the current state of the law.   You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.You might also ask another retail store owner if he or she would recommend their attorney. You should also think about hiring an attorney “on retainer.” This means you pay the attorney a small fee each month and he or she is always available to do legal work for you.As a business owner, you should have a regular attorney on retainer who can answer your legal questions when they arise.  Many laws are introduced to create either a federal restroom law or state laws (in states that don’t already have a requirement). For example, Virginia considered adopting a law in 2013 but decided against it.These bills will continue to pop up, so you should always stay aware of any changes in the law. You can have your business attorney monitor changes in the law. This is one of the primary reasons to always have an attorney on retainer.  Federal U.S. law requires that you provide restroom facilities for your employees, unless you are operating a mobile retail store. You should read the OSHA rules regarding restroom access for employees. Under the rules, the number of bathrooms you must provide depends on the number of employees:One unisex bathroom and a toilet with a locking door for 15 or fewer employees Two toilets for 16-35 employees Three toilets for 36-55 employees Four toilets for 56-80 employees Five toilets for 81-110 employees Six toilets for 111-150 employees An additional toilet for every 40 employees in excess of 150. For example, if you have 230 employees, then you would need to have eight toilets.  State laws typically restrict access to employee restrooms to people with a provable medical condition, such as Crohn’s disease. The person requesting to use the bathroom should present proof of their condition, such as:An identification card A letter from a doctor (or nurse or medical assistant) stating the person has the medical condition  , If your state mandates that you make your employee restrooms available, then you should comply. Your local or state enforcement agency will investigate if there are complaints and you could have to pay a fine.The amount of the fine will vary. In Delaware, for example, you will be fined $100 per violation., The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a 1990 federal law that outlaws discrimination against disabled people in public life. Under Title III, the ADA requires that places of public accommodation be accessible to the disabled. Retail stores qualify as places of public accommodation.If you choose to install public restrooms, then you must make sure that they comply with the ADA.  The ADA requires that you remove physical barriers as part of an ongoing requirement for compliance with the law. You should remove the following barriers before worrying about making your public bathrooms compliant:]  Provide access to the store by removing barriers from public sidewalks, parking, and public transportation. Provide access to the place where your goods are made available.  Once you remove physical barriers to your store, you should then make your public restrooms accessible. You should follow the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (ADAAG). These requirements are quite detailed.   As a general rule, only one stall needs to be accessible. However, if there are six or more stalls in your bathroom, then one stall must be accessible and one must be at least three feet wide. The ADAAG requirements are available online from the Access Board website., Most states also supplement the ADA with their own state anti-discrimination laws. If you install public restrooms, then you may have to abide by these rules.   For example, the Illinois Environmental Barriers Act applies to any new retail construction or the alteration of existing plumbing. This code has detailed requirements for bathrooms, toilet stalls, etc.	Find your state or local law. Meet with an attorney. Be aware of changes in the law. Install bathrooms for your employees. Ask the patron for proof of their medical condition. Comply with the law. Understand the ADA. Remove other barriers to accessibility first. Eliminate barriers to public restrooms. Don’t forget state law requirements.
To the bottom right quarter, draw nine dots, as shown on the setting image.          The dots need to be evenly spaced on a piece of paper that has empty margins. You may want to draw your dots in a different color than the one used for your connecting lines.; , Start at the dot in the bottom right-hand corner.          See how there are four dots on the bottom left and top right? In order to complete this puzzle, you must literally think outside the box! Starting at the bottom right-hand corner, go left and stop where the fourth dot would be. Go diagonally up and to the right connecting two original dots and stop where the fourth dot would be, on the top right. Go down to your original starting point. Go up diagonally to the left, using all nine dots (and two extra points).  A true masterpiece. Now, can your friends do it?	Take a piece of paper. Draw the four lines as shown on the instruction image. Finished.
Do an inventory of your energy usage, your consuming habits, and your reliance on unsustainable products and make a list of ways you intend to curb your unsustainable activities and habits and replace them with sustainable ones. Set yourself a timeline to meet, with harder changes coming at the end of the timeline.   For instance, consider eating meat-free meals twice a week. You could also make a point of turning off lights and electronics when not in use. Another idea is to commit yourself to walking to work or the market as often as possible.  Read the labels of origin and manufacture of your goods, and decide if you can make better choices. Find out if your products are certified as sustainable, organic, locally made, or Fair Trade. There are lots of things a label can tell you if you choose to read it.   Sustainable products include those that are sustainably obtained, for example, all forest products with the FSC logo are logged using sustainable forestry practices. Organic products, such as cotton clothing, cause much less environmental damage than non-organic methods, such as conventional cotton-growing practices. Locally made products decrease the impact on the environment because they travel less miles, which means less emissions, to make it to the consumer. Fair Trade products are ethically produced, and take into account the native people as well as the environmental resources, in the areas they are produced. If you can’t find a label, email or post a message on Facebook to the company, retailer, or manufacturer responsible for the product. Facebook is a great method because lots of other people will check out your question and be waiting for the answer!  , Make a choice to use public transportation more often than you do already to cut back on the amount of noxious fumes introduced into the environment. Carpooling is also a great way to reduce emissions. You can also ride your bicycle or walk to close destinations.  Today is a great day to sign up and get involved with people who are doing rather than talking or reading. Sign up to help restore an old building in town, or join a local water conservation group.  If you have a yard or garden that sits empty, make a plan to plant fruits, veggies, and herbs for personal use, or even bee-friendly flowers. Growing your own food helps reduce strain on the environment. Things you can do that will make the most of your garden include:   Compost your scraps. Use this compost to boost the garden's production. Create a part of it that is edible, and plant seasonal crops. For those of you with merely a balcony or a tiny plot, you can still grow food such as a potato in a bag and small sprout gardens in your windowsill. You could also join a community gardening project. Grow herbs and spices that add flavor to your food, look beautiful in the garden, and that also have medicinal, beauty, healing, spiritual, or other uses. Borrow a book from the library to learn more about herb and spice use. Encourage beneficial and friendly wildlife to your garden through careful planting and shelter creation. Learn to make your own garden sprays using items that are toxic to bugs and mildew but not to people and pets!  , Refuse to buy unsustainable products, reduce your consumption, reuse items and materials around your home, and recycle everything you can. All that clutter has to go somewhere, so make a choice not to bring in into the house to begin with and if it has to leave, make good choices about where it's going to end up!Think about borrowing, sharing, donating, time-sharing, etc., instead of buying for keeps. Or pass it on after you've read/used/watched/worn/enjoyed it.	Adopt an eco-friendly, sustainable lifestyle. Choose to purchase sustainable, organic, or Fair Trade goods. Take public transportation to reduce your environmental impact. Get involved in a conservation, restoration, or eco-community project. Plan your garden space to include edible items. Refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle.
Most network marketing companies have a video presentation either online or on DVD which is shared person to person. These videos are created by professional marketing companies and include a lot of hype and excitement. Many may make you feel that if you don’t join “NOW” you will be missing out on a lot of money. Don’t let the hype tempt you into joining a company that may not be right for you. Always remember you are looking for a long term business that will provide you with a residual income for the rest of your life. Whether you signup today or next month it should not make a difference.; , You may hear terms like “ground floor opportunity” or “start-up”. All this means is that the company is relatively brand new. Statistics show that over 90% of all new companies fail within their first five years.If you are ok with joining a new company in hopes that it will still be around after five years and you are one of the few that “got in early” then this should not be a problem for you. It is however a gamble.  If you can, try to talk to people that are currently involved with the company. Ask the person that is presenting the business opportunity to if they can introduce you to other members, preferably members not in their team and listen to their stories about their experience with the company. This should not be a problem. If it is, it should raise a concern.  In the Network Marketing and Direct Sales industry there is an organization called the Direct Selling Association or DSA (http://www.DSA.org). Out of the thousands of companies in this industry only about 200 companies are members of the DSA. The reason for that is that they require their member companies to abide by a high level of strict business ethics. Requiring that the business you join be a member of the DSA may limit your choices of companies to evaluate. But, it also eliminates any possible scams. If you can’t find a company that is suited to your needs within these 200 odd DSA member companies then maybe you are being extremely picky.  It is extremely important that you give careful thought to this part of your evaluation. You must completely and undoubtedly be committed to and believe in your product. If you don’t, you will never find success. Ask yourself if it’s something you can use. Then ask if you think others can use it too. Is there a benefit to others? Is there value to the end consumer? Is it unique? Spend a lot of time evaluating the product because it’s a very big part of your overall assessment of the company.  Compensation plans come in all shapes and sizes. Some are extremely complex and others are very simple. If the comp plan is too complex how are you supposed to know how much effort will be required for a certain level of pay?   The best type of comp plan is a binary with a twist. Now that probably doesn’t mean much to you and realistically this is a complex subject even when explaining a simple comp plan. Stay away from any comp plans that let you go wide. That means that you can sign up as many people as you like on your first level. The reason is because the only person that benefits from your first level is you. This business is all about helping others attain their goals and dreams and your goals and dreams will happen. You want a comp plan that helps as many people as possible. You also want to stay away from comp plans that “cut off” at a certain level. Again if they cut off at a certain level that means you can build wide on your first level. Simply look for a plan that makes you build deep not wide. That is why a binary plan is best. It requires you to build deep. Now most binary plans obligate you to build both sides evenly. That is where the twist comes in. There are modified binary plans that allow you to be compensated even if your business is not built evenly. If you have never been part of a network marketing business this is going to sound alien to you. Study various compensation plans so you can compare and get a feel for them. The best way to look at a comp plan is through the eyes of a person you sign-up. Ask yourself this, does my helping this new person succeed help me succeed? If the answer is yes then it’s probably a good plan. Another part to the compensation plan is the monthly purchase requirement. This is an obligation the company puts in place that requires that you purchase a certain amount of product every month. Usually that amount falls somewhere between $100 and $500 per month. Be very careful with this because the presentation doesn’t always come out a say what that monthly purchase requirement is. This is a sneaky way for companies to hook you with a small initial membership fee and then hit you over the head with a $300 per month bill. Taking $300 per month as an example gives you a $3,600 yearly expense just in products that you may not use. This one issue has left many people with a bad taste in their mouth about the network marketing industry. Do your homework!  , You want the training and support to be company wide. Basically that means you want the company to be involved in your training and for them to have some sort of training system. You don’t want your training to come solely from your up-line sponsor. The reason for this is that your sponsor may not be a good trainer. You want to make sure you get trained well and understand the system the company uses. Know which is the system the company uses to market and promote their products. Not all companies have a system in place. Some let you do whatever you want in marketing their products and others are very strict on what you can and cannot do. Try to look for a company that has a proven simple duplicatable system that all members use. This makes it very easy for you to learn and teach to others. Duplication is the best way you can help others help themselves.	Understand how these companies are marketed. Look at how long the company has been in business. Try to learn as much as possible about the company itself. Check to see if the company is a member of the Better Business Bureau or other business organizations. Analyze the product or products you will be marketing. Examine the Compensation Plan. Consider training and support.
It’s traditional in Swedish families for the oldest girl to dress as St. Lucia and wake her family at dawn on St. Lucia Day. She wears the same dress and wreath as the girl playing St. Lucia in the procession.  If you don’t already have the clothes, make sure you get these items ahead of St. Lucia Day--you’ll need them at dawn. If there are no daughters in your family, there’s no reason why another family member can’t stand in as St. Lucia!, Swedish families traditionally eat lussekatter on the morning of St. Lucia Day. Lussekatter are cat-shaped saffron buns, but any bun or roll is also suitable. They are eaten with glögg or coffee. Make sure you have the food and drink ready to go before you go to bed!, The person playing St. Lucia should wake up the rest of the household at dawn to wish them a happy St. Lucia Day and to serve the traditional morning snack. Dawn represents the arrival of light in the winter darkness, so it’s important to get up early on St. Lucia Day., In Sweden, television stations show big St. Lucia processions and concerts on the morning of St. Lucia Day. If you aren’t in Sweden, you can look up videos online to recreate the experience in your own home.	Buy the traditional dress or robe. Prepare the morning snacks in advance. Wake up your family at dawn. Watch special holiday programs.
Configure your coals into a two-zone fire. This means that you will cast your coals to cover about half of the grill to produce medium to high-temperature zones.   You can use any coals for grilling. Self-lighting coals are generally easier to work with.  Use a match or lighter to light the edge of a few of the coals. The flame will spread to the other coals in the pile.  If your coals call for lighter fluid, carefully squirt lighter fluid on the top and sides of the charcoal mound. Squirt the lighter fluid gently and wait a minute or two for the fluid to sink into the coals. This will prevent all the lighter fluid from burning off immediately. After waiting a minute, squirt a second layer, followed by a third before lighting your coals. Avoid squirting lots of lighter fluid into your coals during each application. Less fluid is better than more. Lighter fluid can add a chemical taste to your burgers if you use too much.It doesn’t take a lot of lighter fluid to get your fire going. You will only need about 1.6 ounces of lighter fluid per pound of charcoal.  Your coals need time to produce heat and won't be ready immediately after lighting them. Wait for the flames to subside and the edges of the coals turn a light gray. Your coals should be covered completely with gray ash after about 10 minutes. Now you can grill your burgers.  Add your patties to the grill and sear them directly over the pile of coals. This is the hottest part of the grill. Cook your patties for about 5 minutes or until they are brown and crispy at the bottom.          Avoid charring the meat and pressing it down with a spatula. This will squeeze all the delicious juices out. During the cooking process, you will see flare-ups. Don't be alarmed. Flare-ups result from fat dripping into the flame. Move the burgers to the cooler side of the grill if the flames get too high. Move them back when the flames go down.  Use a long-handled metal spatula to flip your burgers once. Sear the other side on the hot part of the grill for about 1 minute to lock in the juices.  Now that your burgers are in their final stage of cooking, it's the perfect time to add a slice of cheese and allow it to melt to perfection. Place your cheese slice centered on each patty and continue to cook your patty as the cheese melts.  Toasting buns is quick and easy. Simply split your buns open and place them on the grill with the cut side down. Make sure to place them on the cooler side of the grill to keep them from burning or cooking too quickly. Grill your buns for about 10 seconds and flip if desired..   You can lightly butter the inside of your buns before toasting if you'd like. Watch the buns closely as they can burn easily.  Once you have seared your patties, move the burgers onto the cooler side of the grill, so they are no longer over direct heat and cover the grill with a lid. Continue cooking for 3 to 5 minutes until done. Here are two ways to check your burgers:          Remove one burger and cut into it. For medium-rare, the inside should be pinkish, but not bloody. Use an instant-read meat thermometer. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C).  Take your burgers off the grill as soon as they are done to avoid overcooking. Remember that they will cook a little bit after they are taken from the grill. Serve your burgers with a variety of condiments	Arrange the coals. Light your charcoal. Light your coals with lighter fluid (optional). Let the coals heat up. Grill your burgers. Flip your burgers. Make it a cheeseburger (optional). Toast your buns (optional). Cover and cook. Enjoy!
It's pretty self-explanatory. Cover up any computer lights, such as the mouse light, or any other lights.  Make sure you pick up every thing you can trip over. Also make sure you pick up all laundry baskets; if you kick them, it can hurt badly.  After you do that, say something like "1 2 3 NOT IT!" or do "Bubble Gum Bubble Gum in a Dish", or something like that to decide who is "it".	Turn all lights off. Clean the floor. Gather a group of friends, or family members. Play in an area, like a huge basement, where you will have plenty of space to hide.
