The federal government makes its spending records available to the public thanks to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, passed in 2006.The website provides information on federal financial assistance and expenditures in a searchable database.   Some of the most tracked federal spending are housing assistance, research and development contracts, and construction contracts. To search the website, go to the main page and type in your search words in the search box located on the top right corner of the page. You will receive a list of relevant results and you will be able to click on any results you want., Most states have an agency or initiative to achieve transparency in state government. This means that the states will show their records to the public. To find your state’s transparency agency, type in your state’s name with “transparency” and “spending” into a search engine.   State transparency agencies can typically be used to search for information on a specific state employee, vendor, or agency.You might also try searching on your state’s department of finance website, which keeps track of government spending at the state level. Type in your state’s name with “department of finance” into a search engine to find your state's information.  Public information websites like www.opensecrets.org track how much money is donated to individual politicians’ campaigns and by whom. It also tracks lobbyists, or those individuals or groups who try to influence government to support certain policies.Search the database by looking for a particular politician, interest group, lobbyist, or PAC (political action committee). Do this by typing your search terms into the search box located in the top right corner of the homepage.  The Library of Congress publishes congressional hearings, bills and resolutions through the THOMAS project. The THOMAS database will eventually be phased out and replaced by www.congress.gov, but until that time, THOMAS will continue to exist as a searchable database.   Use THOMAS to search by word, phrase or bill number. You can then locate text from hearings and policy debates. You can also search the Congressional Record for information on congressional activities. The Congressional Record is the official record of all proceedings, legislation, and debates that take place in the US Congress.	Search the USASpending.gov website.

Ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, but a UV lens filter can access this light, which will eliminate some haziness.  When using filters in photography, the UV lens will protect the surface of your lenses from scratches.  The UV lens filter provides another layer of protection between your camera and your lens.	Use UV filters to sharpen an image by reducing haziness. Fasten an ultraviolet lens to all your lenses. Connect an ultraviolet filter to guard your lenses from dust.
Head to the main valve and turn the water supply off at the source. This will prevent more water from entering the system so that all you need to do is drain the water already inside.   The shut off valve for your sprinkler system should be located in an area that will not be able to freeze over. Oftentimes, the valve will be located inside, in a basement, garage, or utility closet. In some cases, a stop and waste valve will be located underground. It can be as deep as 5 feet (1.5 m) down, so you may need a long key to turn it.  These valves should be located at the end points and low points of your sprinkler system's piping. After opening the valves, the water in the mainline of the system should drain out on its own.  After the mainline finishes draining, open either the boiler drain valve or the drain cap on the stop and waste valve. Open all the test cocks on the backflow device, as well.   Your system will either have a boiler drain valve or a drain cap on a stop and waste valve. It will not have both. The option it does have will vary depending on which option is used in your area, so you can check with neighbors or a local professional to find out which you can expect to find.  If the sprinklers in your system have check valves, you will need to pull up on the sprinklers so that the water can drain out of the bottom of the sprinkler head.   Most sprinklers will have check valves. If yours does not, however, you will need to hope that the water can completely drain out of the other valves along the system instead.  If the location of your drain valves are not positioned well, there could be some water remaining in the backflow, piping, or sprinklers even after you complete this method.   If you want to get at any remaining, trace amounts of water, you could try to suck the water out with a wet/dry shop vac.  It may take several minutes for the water to completely drain out of the backflow, piping, and sprinklers. Once the water finishes draining, you should close all the drain valves you opened previously.	Shut off the water supply. Open the manual drain valves. Drain the remaining water between the shut off valve and backflow device. Pull up on the sprinklers. Watch out for excess water. Close the manual drain valves after draining the water.
It will work in the same manner as the online test does, except for the fact that you have to write your answers down on a piece of paper.  Speak in a loud, clear voice and follow the instructions and advice you're given.  You will be asked questions such as "What are your goals in life?" or "What's your favorite novel?" You may also be asked questions based on the answers you gave on the information sheet you were given to fill out before the start of the audition.	You will be given another 50 question test. You will go through mock-trial gameplay. Prepare for a brief interview.
Only use straight lines going up and down, making buildings of many different sizes. Really try to have variety amongst your buildings, or else your cityscape will be pretty uninteresting.  This will add depth and perspective to your cityscape; just make sure you keep everything in proportion and if you mess up, erase very carefully so as to not smudge any part of the other sketched row., If you add more rows of buildings, remember that the farther they are into the distance, the brighter the shade of grey they need to be., Use rectangles and squares to mimic the windows. Put many together in groups for larger buildings to make them look like apartments, and for warehouses and similar structures don't add any light at all.	Draw a line forming the outline of the buildings.  Add a second row of buildings drawn in front of the first.  Color the back row of buildings in a lighter shade of grey than the second, and paint the sky as though it were dawn.  Add details like random lights turned on in the buildings.
A "stop-loss" is an order that you set up in your brokerage account to limit any losses when the stock market plunges. It triggers a market sell order if the price of the stock sells below a certain level. The assumption is that if the price is falling, it will likely continue to fall. A stop-loss order limits, or stops, the amount you can lose.As another example, let's say you own a stock valued at $30 per share, and you would like to sell it if the price drops by 10% or more. You issue a stop-loss order at $30 minus 10% or $27. If (or when) the stock's price reaches $27, the stop-loss order is converted to a market order and the stock is sold at the next available price.You can set a time period for a stop-loss order, and if the stock is not sold by that time, then the order is canceled. A day order is good until the close of of business on the same day it was placed. A GTC order (good 'til cancelled) order is good for a longer period of time (such as 60 days), or may even have no expiration date.Using a GTC order can help you avoid having to renew a stop-loss order.; , Look at a chart to see daily ranges of a particular stock over a six month period to familiarize yourself with the stock's high and low points. Set a stop-loss within 3% to 7% of the median (middle) trend line. More information can be found on how to set a stop-loss in the book "Technical Analysis of Stock Trends" by Edwards and Magee., Go to the section of your online brokerage account where you can place a trade. Instead of choosing a market order, choose a stop loss order. Enter or scroll down to the price at which you would like to place a stop loss order., Once you've placed the stop order, your broker will watch the stock for you and execute a sale if the share price falls to the pre-selected point. If your stock goes up or fails to move much at all, the stop order will have no effect.	Learn the basics. Calculate the stop-loss price. Place a stop. Relax.
Either slide the glass panels out or lift off the glass globe, depending on the style of lantern you have. Some lanterns have easy-to-remove glass, while others may require minor disassembly with a screwdriver before you can get the glass out.; , Avoid harsh chemical soaps, since these are more likely to scratch or warp the glass.  Use a soft cloth or sponge. Anything rougher will very likely scratch the glass.  Gently wipe the surface of the glass with a clean paper towel as you rinse it. If you still see soot residue, proceed with additional cleansing.  Vigorously shake the bottle to combine the two liquids.  Use this towel to wipe down the glass. Apply a gentle pressure, just firm enough to scrub away the ash.  Apply the solution liberally over the surface of the glass.  The glass should be completely dry. This should remove the soot, but if you still notice ashy residue, additional cleaning may be advised.  The tub should be just big enough to fit the glass panels or globe.  Prevent the panels from overlapping as much as possible. The glass needs to be exposed in order to get the full effect of the treatment.  The fizzing should remove much of the soot.  Allow all sides of the glass to get exposure to the new solution.  The cleansers in the denture tablets will still be active long after they stop dissolving.  Wipe it dry with a clean microfiber cloth.  By now, all traces of soot should be gone. The glass may appear foggy, however, which could still hinder the way light shines through the lantern.  Glass-top stove cleaners are preferable to window cleaners, since stove cleaners are more likely to withstand hot temperatures and less likely to be flammable. Gently wipe the glass with a clean paper towel or microfiber cloth until it appears dry, transparent, and streak-free.  Doing so will allow it the chance to completely dry.  Slide or screw it back into place as necessary.	Remove the glass. Combine mild dishwashing soap and warm water in a medium bowl. Immerse the glass in the soapy water and gently scrub it. Rinse the glass under running water. Mix 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) vinegar with 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto a clean paper towel. Spray the vinegar solution directly on the glass. Wipe the solution off the glass with a clean microfiber cloth. Fill a small tub or container with warm water. Place the glass elements into the tub. Drop two to four denture tablets into the tub. Turn the glass over once the tablets finish dissolving. Allow the glass to sit in the solution several hours to overnight. Remove the glass from the solution. Inspect your glass. Spray the glass with glass cleaner. Set the glass out on a clean table or counter for several hours. Return the glass to the lantern.
Add two perpendicular guidelines to help position the eyes and nose overlapping the head. , These are a bit flatter on the bottom than on the other sides, sort of like a very rounded, very tall semicircles.          Inside each eye draw two ovals, one inside the other, near the inside edge of his eyes. Add the eyebrows, two crescent-shapes, directly below the hat.  Depending on the angle, this is usually just a large circle meets the bottom of his eyes.          Sketch out his mustache directly below his nose. It's made up of two lines parallel to the flattish bottom of his eyes, both ending a little past the end of his eyebrows, and a curve connecting the ends of them. For now, this should look like a crude D that's tipped over.  Depending on the angle, this may need to be more of a pear shape.          Draw the arm and leg shapes. These are all about the same length as his head, hat included, and get just a little wider at the end farthest from his body. Sketch the hands and feet. The hands are just circles, while the feet are a cross between ovals and beans-they are perfectly round on the inside and bean-shaped on the outside.  Give Mario some fingers and his shoes some soles (if you can see them). Draw the bumps on the bottom of his mustache and clarify his hat some. Finish this step by adding details to his clothes. Don't forget the M on Mario's hat!          Review your drawing. Now is the time to fix up any mistakes. When you're satisfied, clean up the lines you don't want.  This helps ensure that they aren't visible afterwards.Mario is now ready for action!	Draw a circle for Mario's head. Roughly sketch out his hat, keeping in mind that this covers his entire forehead.         , Draw two smaller ovals, one for each eye. Draw Mario's nose. Draw a circle slightly larger than the head for the body. Draw the details. Color Mario, lightly erasing all of your lines beforehand (but making sure they're still slightly visible).
Your age will have a significant impact on your investment strategy.Generally speaking, the younger you are, the more risk you can take. That's because you have more time to recover from a market downturn or loss of value in a particular investment. So, if you're in your 20's, you can allocate more of your portfolio to more aggressive investments (like growth-oriented and small-cap companies for example). If you're nearing retirement, allocate more of your portfolio to less aggressive investments, like fixed-income, and large-cap value companies.; , Be aware of how much disposable income you have available to invest. Take a look at your budget and determine how much money is left over for investments following your monthly expenses and after you have set aside an emergency fund equivalent to three to 6 months' worth of expenses.  Your risk profile determines how much risk you're willing to take.Even if you're young, you might not want to take a lot of risks. You'll select your investments based on your risk profile.   Generally speaking, stocks are more volatile than bonds, and bank accounts (checking and savings accounts) are not volatile.Remember, there are always risk trade-off's to be made. Often, when you take less risk, you make less. Investors are richly rewarded for taking significant risks, but they can also face steep losses., What do you want to do with the money you make from your investments? Do you want to retire early? Do you want to buy a nice house? Do you want a boat?As a rule of thumb, you're going to want a diversified portfolio no matter what your goal is (buying a house, saving for a child's college education, etc.). The idea is to let the investment grow over a long period of time so that you have enough to pay for the goal. If your goal is particularly aggressive, you should put more money in the investment periodically rather than opting for a more risky investment. That way, you're more likely to achieve your goal rather than lose the money that you've invested.  How soon do you want to reach your financial goals? That will determine the type of investments you make.   If you're interested in getting a great return on your investment quickly, and you are prepared to take the risk that you could also see a great loss just as quickly, then you'll select more aggressive investments that have the potential for significant return. These include undervalued stocks, penny stocks, and land that might quickly appreciate in value. If you're interested in building wealth slowly, you'll select investments that generate a slower return on investment over time.  A "liquid" asset is defined as an asset that can be easily converted to cash. That way, you'll have quick access to the money if you need it in an emergency.Stocks and mutual funds are very liquid and can be converted into cash, usually in a matter of days. Real estate is not very liquid. It usually takes weeks or months to convert a property to cash.  You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. For example: Every month, you might want to put 30% of your investment money into stocks, another 30% into bonds, and the remaining 40% into a savings account. Adjust those percentages and investment options so that they're in line with your financial goals.  If you put 90% of your disposable income into stocks every month, then you're going to lose a lot of money if the stock market crashes. That might be a risk that you're willing to take, but be sure that's the case.  If you're uncertain about how to set up a plan in line with your goals and your risk profile, talk to a qualified financial adviser and get some feedback., There are many different accounts you might use for an investment plan. Familiarize yourself with some of the basics and figure out what works for you.   Set up a short-term emergency savings account with three to six months worth of living expenses. It's important to have this established to protect yourself if something unexpected happens (job loss, injury or illness, etc.). This money should easy to access in a hurry. Consider your options for long-term savings. If you are thinking about saving up for retirement, you may want to set up an IRA or 401(k). Your employer may offer a 401(k) plan in which they will match your contribution.If you want to start an education fund, think about 529 plans and Education Savings Accounts (ESAs). Earnings from these accounts are free from federal income tax as long as they’re used to pay for qualified education expenses., Check to see if they're performing according to your goals. If not, reevaluate your investments and determine where changes need to be made.  Generally speaking, as you get older, you'll want to take less risk. Be sure to adjust your investments accordingly.   If you have money in risky investments, it's a good idea to sell them and move the money to more stable investments when you get older. If your finances tolerate the volatility of your portfolio very well, you might want to take on even more risk so that you can reach your goals sooner.  It may be the case that you're not putting enough money from every paycheck into your investments to make your goals. On a more positive note, you might find that you're way ahead of reaching your goals and that you're putting too much money into your investments on a regular basis. In either case, adjust your contributions accordingly.	Select an age-appropriate investment option. Understand your current financial situation. Develop your risk profile. Set goals for your investments. Establish a timeline for your goals. Determine the level of liquidity you want. Decide on how you want to diversify. Ensure that your plan is in line with your risk profile. Consult a financial adviser. Investigate your options. Monitor your investments from time to time. Determine if you need to change your risk profile. Evaluate whether or not you're contributing enough to reach your financial goals.
Avoid cleaning your roof in direct sunlight. Keep in mind that metal and light-colored paint will reflect sunlight and create glare, which may drastically reduce your vision. If the layout of your roof requires you to climb onto it, do so when it’s dry out to reduce the risk of slipping.Of course, once you start washing your roof, it will get wet and pose a risk. However, it’s still a smart idea to reduce that risk as much as possible.; , Before you haul all of your gear up, set up your ladder. Climb onto the roof and judge your ability to reach all of its parts. If you feel that certain parts are too precarious for you to safely reach, err on the side of caution and do not attempt to clean it.Keep in mind that your power washer or hose will extend your reach considerably. If any out-of-reach areas look like they need scrubbing afterward, hire a professional to do so.  Do not attempt to wash your roof alone. Whether you need to mount the roof itself or can do the job from a ladder, play it safe. Ask someone to spot you so they can:Assist you in bringing gear up and down. Alert you to any hazards that you may not be aware of. Call for help in the event of an accident.  Protect yourself from a fall. Wear a safety harness. Attach a safety line between that and a sturdy feature of your roof (like a chimney).If none are available, use either a:Bolt-strap anchor for corrugated roofs. Ridge clamp for standing-seam roofs.  Expect clean water alone to get the job done most of the time. Save yourself the time and money and use chemical cleaners only when absolutely necessary.Expect these to leave behind streaks and film if you don’t thoroughly rinse them off.Rinsing your roof with water at least once a year should reduce the need for using chemical cleaners.  Don’t expect a simple splash of water to accomplish much. Use pressurized water to blast dirt away. For a light job, start by using your garden hose and a wand or spray nozzle attachment and see if its jet setting is strong enough to work. If not, rent or invest in a power washer and use that instead., Avoid stepping directly onto dirt, grime, and debris. Treat any material other than the roof itself as unstable. Before climbing onto or advancing along your roof, use your hose or power washer to clear a path for yourself to reduce the chance of slipping.If you have to first clear a path in order to attach safety lines and other gear to the roof, wait until the washed path has dried before climbing onto the roof.  Make washing easier by cleaning the highest points first so the dirty runoff flows over yet-to-cleaned sections. Continue blasting dirt and debris by advancing downward along the roof’s slope while steadily pushing dirt and debris down toward its edge. However:Roof designs vary greatly, so don’t treat this as an absolute must. If your roof is particularly steep and/or has sections well out of reach, always opt for safety and hose it down from a lower, safer point.  Don’t rush the job. Opt for a slow and steady approach to ensure safety. Advance along your roof at a safe pace while minding your footing at all times to minimize the risk of slipping., For any areas that don’t wash away with pressurized water, fill a bucket or other container with water. For every part water, combine 0.05 part mild dish or laundry detergent., Opt for something soft to protect your roof’s paint and parts. Avoid using more abrasive materials like steel wool or wire brushes. Expect these to scratch and otherwise damage your roof., Soak your cloth or sponge in the water/detergent mixture. Scrub from the bottom of the panel upward in a left-to-right, back-and-forth fashion. Once each panel is clean, rinse it immediately with clean water to prevent streaks and film. Then wipe the panel again with a cloth or sponge soaked in plain water.With persistent dirt that refuses to come off, go slow and steady and scrub for longer rather than apply more pressure to speed things up. The more pressure you add, the greater the risk of damaging the panel.  If stains or other eyesores remain no longer how you scrub with your detergent solution, check with the roof’s manufacturer or installer about using stronger agents, since some may damage the roof, depending on its materials.Whichever cleaner they recommend, follow its directions regarding use. Scrub the dirty panels in question in the same manner that you did with your detergent solution.If the cleaner has bleach as an ingredient, rinse the scrubbed area with clean water immediately afterward. Do not wait until you complete a whole panel as you did with the detergent. Rinse all panels again when the entire job is finished.	Wait for dry weather and overcast skies. Clean only those areas that are easily reached. Have a partner. Secure yourself. Favor using plain water over chemical cleaners. Use pressure. Clear a path first. Start from the top if possible and blast downward. Work slowly and patiently. Mix water and mild detergent for stubborn areas. Use a cloth or sponge to clean. Scrub problem areas with your detergent solution. Repeat with stronger cleaners if necessary.
If you can afford a family law attorney, you should consider hiring one to help you navigate the child custody process. See this article for directions on how to find a good family law attorney. Even if you cannot afford a full-service attorney, many attorneys provide limited services at a reasonable cost. This means you may be able to hire an attorney to prepare your documents, give you limited legal advice, or potentially even teach you about this area of the law, without having to pay the attorney to take on the entire visitation process.; , The entire lawsuit will begin when the other parent files a complaint for custody. When the other parent files this lawsuit, they will be required to serve you with all of the documents related to the case. When you get served with these papers, read them right away so you know what your child's other parent is asking the court to do and how you have to respond.The most common documents you will be served with include:   The complaint for custody. This document tells the court about you, your child, and your child's other parent.It will also have information about what the other parent is requesting the court to do.In this instance, the complaint will most likely state that the other parent is asking for a certain custody arrangement with the child. The summons. The summons is a document issued by the clerk of courts where the lawsuit was filed and it tells you, the defendant, how long you have to respond to the complaint.The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act affidavit. This standard document will contain information about your child and where they have lived for the past five years.A blank response form. While not required in every jurisdiction, you may receive a blank response form, which is the document you will use to answer the other party's complaint.  One of the most important pieces of information you will find in the packet of information you are served with is the strict deadline for responding to the complaint.The deadline will be clearly stated in the summons that you receive.You must respond in some way by the stated deadline or you risk the court entering a default judgment against you.If a default judgment is entered against you, you may not be able to participate in the case and the other party may receive exactly what they asked for in their complaint., If your child's other parent has decided to file a lawsuit for custody of the child, you will have an opportunity to respond in a number of different ways. The response you choose will depend on how you want the case to proceed. Consider the following types of responses you could utilize:    Do not respond. If you read through the complaint you were served with and decide you do not wish to get involved, you can simply ignore the complaint. If you choose to do nothing, a default judgment will likely be entered on behalf of the other party and they will likely get everything they asked for from the court.This might be a viable option if you agree with all of the other party's proposed actions.However, even if you agree with the other party's proposals, you should consider filing an answer so you have the opportunity to participate in the case.File a motion to dismiss. If you do not think the other party's complaint states any legitimate claim for relief, you can file a motion to dismiss. A motion to dismiss is a document asking the court to throw out the lawsuit. There are a number of reasons a lawsuit could be thrown out including a lack of jurisdiction or a failure to state a claim. For more information about writing and filing a motion to dismiss, look here. Also, look here for a sample motion to dismiss.  Submit a counterclaim. A counterclaim is a document that lets the court know what you would like to happen in your custody case.It is a document that looks a lot like the original complaint you were served with, and will lay out the reasons you deserve custody and why the other party does not. A counterclaim is different from an answer. An answer is a direct response to the other party's complaint while a counterclaim includes new facts and new legal claims. For more information about counterclaims, look here.  File an answer. An answer is a direct response to the other party's original complaint. An answer will respond to each paragraph of the other party's complaint by allowing you the opportunity to admit, deny, or state that you do not have enough information to respond to each paragraph at issue., When you start to write your answer, look through the documents you received when you were served with the lawsuit as there may be an answer form provided for you. If there is no answer form provided to you, contact the court that the lawsuit was filed in and ask if they have an answer form you can utilize. If no form is available you can create your own answer from scratch. Whether you have a form or are creating your own answer, follow the directions below to write an effective answer.   First, create a header that includes your name and contact information, the other party's name and contact information, the title of the court hearing the case, and the case number.Second, go through the complaint paragraph by paragraph and respond to each allegation within. Generally, for each paragraph, you will: (1) admit all of the statements in the paragraph; (2) deny all of the statements in the paragraph; (3) admit some of the statements in the paragraph and deny others; or (4) state that you do not have enough information to know whether the statements in the paragraph are true or not.This is the main body of your answer but that does not mean it needs to be overly complicated. Make the answer simple and straightforward and only include the information necessary to respond to each paragraph's allegations. Third, include a section with other defenses you want to raise.This section will include any other relevant facts you want the court to know about.You might include facts about your relationship with the child and your ability to care for the child that the other party left out of their complaint. Fourth, include a specific request to the court.This will be at the end of your answer and will provide the court with an idea of what you would consider an acceptable outcome. Oftentimes the request will be for a dismissal of the complaint; a granting of whatever relief was sought in the complaint; or a partial grant of relief.The request you make will depend on how you respond to the claims in the complaint. If you agree with the allegations in the complaint, you might ask the court to accept it. However, if you would like to contest the complaint, you might ask the court to deny relief or dismiss the case.  Once you have created your answer, you will need to sign the document, make copies, and include a service form. When you sign the document, you may have to do it in front of a notary or in person at the courthouse, so be sure you follow the rules in your jurisdiction. Also, most courts will require that you file an original answer and potentially even a certain number of copies, so be sure you know what to bring to the courthouse when you file your response. Finally, an answer will have to be served on the other party so make sure you provide a service form with your answer.A service form is a certification that will be used when the other party is served and will provide the court with a guarantee that service was conducted., Once you have prepared your answer, you will need to file it with the same court the other party filed their complaint with. Make sure you look at the documents you received when you were served to determine the correct courthouse to go to. This information can usually be found on the summons.If for some reason you think the other party filed their case in the wrong county, you can ask the court to move the case to a different county., Take your answer and any accompanying documents to the courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts.Ask the clerk of courts to look the documents over to ensure they have been completed correctly.Some courts may want multiple copies of your documents, so be sure you know what your specific courthouse wants.There is usually no filing fee for an answer.  When you serve the other party, you will hire someone (the sheriff or another competent adult) to give a copy of your filed documents to the other party to look over and respond to. To serve the other party, the person you hire must provide the required documents to them, either in person or through the mail.If you are serving someone through the mail, it must be sent by certified mail. In Pennsylvania, this process must be completed within 30 days of filing your documents with the court.In some states (e.g., Michigan), your answer must also be served on the other party at least five days before the hearing if you provided service through the mail, and at least three days before the hearing if you have the other party served personally.For more information about serving another party, look here.   Once you serve the other party with your answer, you will have successfully filed your answer and notified the other party of your filing. From here, the court process will include a number of hearings, conferences, and meetings meant to resolve the child custody lawsuit.	Consider hiring an attorney. Read the papers you have been served with carefully. Pay attention to deadlines. Determine how you will respond. Formulate your answer. Prepare your answer for filing. Go to the appropriate courthouse. File your answer with the clerk of courts. Serve the other party.
Shuffling your tiles can help you find playable words, as well as find prefixes, partial words, and common letter combinations. When looking for candidate plays, you also want to make sure your remaining tiles don't contain an imbalance of consonants and vowels, or contain duplicate tiles that will inhibit you from making a high scoring play next turn.Make sure that you exchange some of your letters if you end up with too many vowels. You should not have more than 2-3 vowels on your rack at any one time.; , The premium squares (double letter, triple letter, double word, and triple word) can dramatically increase your score. Therefore, it is a good idea to make plays using these squares. Doing so will increase your chances of winning the game., Often in Scrabble, you can lay your word alongside (or above or below) an existing word to create a number of 2 or 3-letter words in addition to your main word. The reward for parallel plays can be significant.  Serious Scrabble players memorize lists of high scoring words to improve their chances of winning. Some common words include QAT, XU, OXO, JIAO, JEU, ZOA, ZEE, and AJI. These words will allow you to score extremely well on future turns.   Try to memorize some of the high scoring two letter words such as Jo, Qi, and Za. These words are easier to remember because they are so short, but they are also great score boosters.  Although your opponent(s) may not be too pleased, you can add “S” to many words and get an easy points boost. This strategy works even better if the word is long, has a high points value, or if the “S” falls on a premium square. Watch for opportunities to add “S” to an opponent’s word as you play., Compound words are also great score boosters in Scrabble. For example, if an opponent plays BALL and you have the letters to play AIR, then you can play AIR in front of BALL and create the compound word AIRBALL. Playing compound words like this one will improve your score and increase your chances of winning the game., A bingo is a word that uses all 7 tiles in your rack simultaneously in one play. In addition to the points that your play would normally score, you will get an extra 50 points added to your score. It is not always easy to find a bingo: look for 7 letter words in your rack that might fit on the board as well as 8+ letter plays that might play through existing tiles on the board.  You can help yourself maintain a lead or get a lead by playing certain types of words. If you are trailing your opponent(s), your best bet is to play words that will open up the board and give you opportunities to make better plays. If you are in the lead, then you should play words that will keep the board closed off to your opponents and reduce their opportunities to make better plays., Advanced Scrabble players are always looking ahead to what their opponents might do. Get into the habit of considering what your opponent may do if you play a certain word and try to block any premium squares that your opponent may want to use during his or her turn.Keep in mind that blocking your opponent may not always be possible, but if you do it whenever possible, it may help you to hold onto your lead and win the game.	Learn to manage your rack. Play words on premium squares. Make parallel word plays whenever possible. Memorize high scoring words in Scrabble using tiles such as the J, Q, X, and Z. Use “S” to get points from your opponent’s best plays. Extend words when you can. Try to play a bingo. Make plays based on your lead. Block off the premium squares.
Creating a budget, either written or online, will help you get rid of your debt, improve your credit, and stay out of debt. While the credit bureaus won't see your budget, it will see the good results of your sticking to it., Getting rid of as much of your debt as you can is the first and most important step in improving your credit. Make a list of all debts and prioritize which ones to pay off first.   Try the avalanche technique. To pay your debts off as quickly as possible, start by paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. Continue to pay off your debts, working your way down from the highest interest rates to the lowest. You can also try the snowball technique. With this method, you pay off your smallest debt first and work your way up. This is not always the most efficient way to pay off your debts in terms of saving money, but the sense of accomplishment that comes with successfully paying off a debt, even a small one, can help motivate you to keep at it. To remove the temptation, "retire" of some of your credit cards as you pay them off. Too much credit can be a bad thing. Closing credit accounts can have a negative effect on your credit score; a better solution is to pay off excess cards and stop using them without closing the account. Cut up the card so you won't be tempted to use it.  If you are having trouble getting credit due to a poor credit score, or you are a first timer, apply for a secured credit card from your bank. This type of card uses money in your savings account as security. This is an easy way to establish a great credit history.)  , Note that "paying off" loans increases your score. Oddly enough, occasionally refinancing your mortgage and trading in cars with loans on them "pays off" loans, too. If you do refinance, do it for no points and a lower rate.  If you experience a job loss or other misfortune, contact your lenders right away. The worst thing you can do is ignore them. Explain your financial situation and agree on a new payment schedule that you can manage. Get the agreement in writing and ask them to include a note that your payments will not be reported as late.  A "healthy mix" of different types of credit builds up your score better than simply one type. For example, you might have a car loan, mortgage or line of credit and a credit card.   Let's say two people have $10,000 total in total credit each, and both are making timely payments. One has only one credit card. The other has a credit card, a car payment and a bank line of credit (overdraft protection). The second person's score will often be much better than the first one's.  If you need any kind of advice to help get out of debt and improve your credit history, find a find a low or zero cost agency to help you. There might be free services available from your employer, military base, credit union, housing authority, or a local branch of the U.S. Cooperative Extension.Beware of for-profit companies that charge you a fee and promise to have all or most of your debts forgiven. Even if they pull it off, your credit score will plummet.	Make a budget and stick to it. Get out of debt. Apply for a secured credit card. Refinance loans as appropriate. Contact the lender if you cannot make payments on time. Build up different types of credit. Meet with a credit counseling agency.
A home's centre is often the kitchen. In this day and age, it is often the case that the whole family gets to see each other for meals and so it is important that it smells great. The smell of baking bread is amazingly good. If you don't have the time to bake your own, buy some from the bakers. That way, you get a lovely smelling kitchen AND yummy food!; , Flowers can make a whole room smell lovely-why not try growing them in your garden or even in a window-box? Then when spring/summer comes around, your house will smell gorgeously like flowers and the outdoors  , Houses will smell stuffy if there is no air. If it's a nice day, let the air in. Even have your door open if it's safe to do so. That way, you'll seem friendly and when you have guests in they will compliment you on your great smelling home  , The bathroom is a difficult one to get smelling good naturally. Try the previous step-opening a window to let the fresh air in, or try using bicarbonate of soda/vinegar to dispel any bad odours. If you have a bathroom extractor fan, obviously run that when someone is in the toilet  , Choose nice, natural good smelling products that complement each other For example, switch to beeswax polish which smells absolutely gorgeous-just rub it on in small,circular motions to release the smell and also to leave your unpolished wooden surfaces shining and healthy. Pair this with a natural lavender cleaning spray to evoke the smells of summer and a garden buzzing with busy bees  , Some examples could be changing bins regularly, doing any washing up that's left on the side, and clearing up small spills will help your house to smell lovely.	Do something that smells great, like bake bread. Find some good smelling flowers. Open the windows!, Try different things with the bathroom. Incorporate your cleaning routine into creating a great smell for your house. Try simple things.
Think realistically about space, weight, and suitability of the new house and/or climate for your existing plants. If you're moving interstate, check local quarantine regulations on plant movement and if moving overseas, it's likely that you cannot move plants, or that to do so will be extremely costly.; , Clean them up several weeks prior to the move so that they're not stressed by carrying disease, dead leaves and branches, etc. Prune, deadhead, and generally tidy up the plants.   The less foliage on a plant, the less effort the plant has to put into protecting itself as a whole.  It's a good idea to get professional advice if possible.   Dig up well ahead of time, months if possible. Wrap the root ball in hessian cloth. Place the plant in a cool, shaded area of the garden. Keep the root ball moist (not wet) at all times. Move with care; try not to move it more than necessary from the time it's dug out of the ground to the moment it is loaded on the moving truck.  Check the plants for pests and weeds one week prior to the moving. Eliminate them. You don't want to carry them with you and if the new place doesn't have an infestation of the same pests, here is a chance to break the cycle for your plants.   A quick fix for both plant and soil is to place the entire plant and container into an opaque plastic bag with a flea collar or pest strip. Leave overnight and remove the plastic bag the next morning.  Cardboard boxes are the best choice for most plants as they're sturdy and breathe. Use dampened newspaper or packing paper to hold the plants in place within the boxes.   Protect the leaves using paper. Float a thin, damp layer of paper over the top of each plant to act as a protective layer.  Write "PLANTS. HANDLE WITH CARE." in large letters.  Give the plants a quick spray spritz and close the lids. Punch breathing holes into various parts of the boxes.  Along with pets, plants should be your top priority for settling in quickly.   Take plants out from the base of the box. This will ensure that you handle the heaviest end of the plant and avoid damaging the stem. Keep the plants in darker lit areas initially and gradually return them to brighter light, to give them a chance to adjust to the brighter light/sunshine again.	Decide which plants are going to move with you. Prepare the plants a few weeks ahead. If digging up and transplanting plants from your garden, plan well ahead. Remove pests and weeds. Put the plants into suitable containers the day before moving. Clearly mark the boxes so that the movers know what they're dealing with. Close the boxes on moving day itself. Unpack plants as soon as they arrive.
A reel-spinning slot machine typically features three or five reels or cylinders on which there are imprinted symbols as well as spaces left blank. There are 22 symbols/blanks or "stops" on each reel. Matching these symbols in certain combinations lead to a winning payout. Video slots may have up to seven reels, each representing three rows of five symbols. Video slots have 32 to hundreds of virtual stops on their reels.  Video slot machines may use some of these traditional images but are likely to feature characters or symbols from popular TV shows, cartoons or movies or images of popular actors, singers or sports figures. , Both are controlled by a program called a random number generator (RNG) that determines the outcome of each spin and makes it impossible to determine the outcome of future spins.  There are two main categories for progressive slots machines: “top payout” and “progressive”. With top payouts, that’s how much you could stand to win for “regular” best machine combinations. Some slot machines are known as "flat-top" machines; they have a fixed, maximum payout. Progressive machines feature a meter that indicates a jackpot that gets progressively higher. These machines are linked together and the amount of the jackpot is determined by how much they're being used. The more people play them, the higher the jackpot amount.   Among flat-top machines, the overall odds are generally similar no matter how high the jackpot is. Sometimes a bank of progressive machines in a single casino are linked together. In other cases, the machines are linked throughout the entire state, which explains why they feature such a high jackpot amount. Because of the number of people all vying for that jackpot, your odds of winning at a progressive machines are lower. That goes not only for the jackpot amount, but the odds of winning smaller amounts are lower as well.  To play a slot machine, you must first insert bills or coins. When you insert your money, the equivalent amount of credits is displayed. Your next move depends on the type of machine you've chosen.   On reel-spinning slots, push a button marked "play one credit" until you've reached the number of coins you wish to play. Then hit the "spin reels" button or pull the handle. If you want to bet big, you can hit a button marked "play max credits," which will play the maximum coins allowed on that machine. On video slots, you must push two buttons to complete your bet. First, push one button for the number of paylines you want to activate and then push a second button to chose how many credits you want to bet per line. Video slots generally have five reels spinning on the screen.  Your payout is determined by a winning combination of symbols that appear on what's called the payline. On classic reel spin machines, only one payline is displayed on the face of the machine, but video machines offer more paylines.   Modern multi-line slots may offer 9, 15, 25, 50 and even more paylines. Paylines can be represented horizontally, vertically, diagonally and even in zigzags. Look closely to see what lines you have bet and check carefully as it can be difficult to tell if you have a winning payline.  If you don't understand them, ask an attendant or call customer service if you are playing online. You need to understand what combinations will win you money, especially the jackpot.	Pick a reel-spinning slot or a video slot. The symbols on a reel-spinning slot machine include brightly colored images of fruits such as lemons and cherries, numerals or shapes such as diamonds, hearts and bells. Some players like the reel-spinning slots with the pull handle because of their retro feel, but they can be difficult to find as more casinos modernize their slot selection.  , Despite the difference in style, there is no difference in the payout between reel-spinning and video machines of the same denomination. Choose a machine with a fixed or a progressive jackpot. Place your bet. Pick your paylines. Familiarize yourself with the rules for the machine before you sit down.
The simplest way to approach networking is with 2 primary goals in mind: 1) Get to know people; ASK questions about their business and how you may be able to help them. 2) Get them to know you; TELL them about your business and how they may be able to help you. As you can see, the goal of networking is to build relationships, NOT trying to sell and grab as many business cards as possible by the end of the event! When you take the focus away from trying to get business from the contacts you meet and focus on building a relationship, they are more responsive, and over time they will start to become “referral machines” for you and/or “open doors” for developing business opportunities. Keep in mind that it’s important for you to return the good will by giving referrals as well. Key reasons for building relationships through networking are:   Partnering your products/service offerings Referring business contacts and opportunities to each other Asking for advice Exchanging ideas; , There is often a page on a trade show's site titled “Networking Opportunities and Orientation” where you can find a list of events. When you are at the show, look in the Show Guide; be sure to add the events you want to attend to your calendar. When attending other shows, the show site typically always has a list of networking events, but the page may have a different title than the Exhibitor Show’s event listing. Some events offered at this show are listed on the website as: Opening Reception, Welcome Reception, Dinner With Strangers, The Square and Peer2PeerRoundtables. Don’t forget to be on the lookout for exhibitor sponsored events as well; invites may be received by postal mail, email or at exhibitor booths.  Ask yourself the following questions: What will occur at the event? What type of people will attend this event? Are these the type of people whose business I can help and whom can help my business? Ask if a list of attendees or companies is available. If yes, review the list.  This can range from general items such as "Title", "Company", "Industry", etc., or can be specific names of contacts.  Below are some examples you can use to get started:   What does your company do? What industry do you serve? Who are your key prospects/clients? What type of products do you have? What is your competitive advantage? What got you started in this industry/job? What do you enjoy most about the profession you are in? What trends do you foresee in your industry/profession? What marketing/sales activities have you found to be the most successful for your business? Can you refer me to someone that does ___?  ,   Is there anyone here you can refer me to who needs a ____type of product/service? I was looking to meet with ____, can you point me in their direction? Do you have any suggestions for who I can speak with about ____? One of my goals for the evening is to meet with someone who does ____, are you aware of anyone here that does ____you can introduce me to?  , Create a list of statements you can use when offering an introduction. Below is a list of examples.   Let’s “work the room” together and see if there is anyone here I can introduce you to. Your product/service is a good fit for my colleague ____. Let me introduce you to him/her. The speaker was very interesting, let’s go introduce ourselves, I want to tell him/her about your fascinating product/service. Let me introduce you to an associate of mine. My colleague ____is here, let’s go say “hi” and I will introduce you.  Ask yourself: can you help them AND can they help you? When considering if this contact can help you, remember that the purpose of the relationship should not be to get their business, but to get business from everyone they know!  ,   Learn more about the contact(s) business, products and personal interests; consider setting up an initial in-person appointment for about 1 hour, or via phone if that works better. Further educate them on your company, products and your personal interests. Touch base often; try getting together in person whenever possible. #*After you have built a relationship and developed a level of trust, start introducing them to other appropriate contacts of yours; in turn they are likely to do the same. When looking for referrals, vendor recommendations and general business advice, turn to your base of contacts.  Just like in your personal life, maintaining a business relationship takes work too; keep these helpful tips in mind, so a contact doesn't "break up" with you.   Touch base often, particularly with your "most valuable" contacts; go to lunch or dinner, attend an event together, or simply pick up the phone and chat a bit. Check in with all contacts periodically to maintain the relationship; even a simple quick email or card will do the trick. Prioritize contacts every so often; as your contact base grows, evaluate which contacts you should be in touch with frequently, or just periodically.	Understand the purpose of networking. Look for networking events pre-show. Take ample time to learn about a trade show event’s focus and who will be there, to pre-determine whether the event fits the targeted type of relationships that will help your business. Create a list of people you want to meet at each event to build relationships with, once you have determined targeted events to attend. Create a pre-determined list of open ended questions to ask for learning more information about the contacts you meet. Have a list of sample questions ready that you can use to ask for referrals to contacts you would like to meet at the event. Find ways to make introductions for other people. Evaluate your contacts. Build a deeper relationship with your valuable contacts. Maintain your relationship with your contacts.
Grease all exposed moving parts after cleaning with any lubricant that does not create buildup, such as WD40., If the head is embedded in the ground, remove any grass or weeds that are too close to the unit. If the sprinkler is above ground, make sure it is on a level surface with no obstructions. Try placing a board underneath your sprinkler to give it more stability and prevent its components from directly coming into contact with dirt and future debris.  Clean them at least twice a year. It is most important to do so before storing for the winter, in order to keep them working in ideal conditions. This will help prevent major clogging, and your lawn will thank you.If you still have poor water distribution, a clog may not be the only problem, check your water pressure and for any kinks in the hose as this will interfere with your sprinkler's ability to function properly.	Lubricate any moving parts. Clear the area around the sprinkler head. Clean sprinkler heads regularly.
Florida no longer requires “fault” for a divorce. Instead, both parties must claim that the marriage is “irretrievably broken.”Fault may be considered later, when deciding alimony, equitable division of marital property, and child custody.; , In order to get a divorce in Florida, one party must have been a resident of the state for the preceding 6 months., Couples who have children must take an online course before filing for divorce. Sometimes the children must also take a course specially designed for them.One recommended Parent Education and Family Stabilization Course costs $19.95. You should expect to pay a fee for the class.If you are getting a Simplified Divorce, then you do not have to take this class (because a requirement of a Simplified Divorce is that you have no children). You should contact the court clerk with questions about the specific course approved for your county.  A divorce is a stressful experience, and an experienced family law attorney can help relieve your stress by handling all of the paperwork necessary to file for divorce. You can find a reputable family law attorney by visiting the referral service available at the Florida Bar Association’s website.   Florida attorneys can be certified as specialists in Marital and Family law. You should look at an attorney’s website to see if he or she is certified as a specialist. If costs are a concern, be aware that Florida courts are empowered to award attorney’s fees to a party, particularly when the spouses are in different financial positions.If you have far less financial resources than your spouse, you may be able to qualify for this fee shifting. A Simplified Divorce is designed so that no attorney is necessary, though you may have one if you prefer. Because no children are involved in a Simplified Divorce, you may only want to speak to an attorney if you have questions about how to divide marital property.  If possible, you and your spouse should attempt to meet and decide on child custody. A joint stipulation on custody issues will be honored by the court if the court finds that it is in the best interest of the child.   In the absence of an agreement, the court will have to hold a trial. A trial can be time-consuming, expensive, and stressful. Also, people’s positions tend to harden throughout a trial, making it difficult to work with the other parent after the trial has ended and custody has been awarded.  Before filing for a “simplified divorce,” you will need to have come to agreement on a marital settlement. Marital property includes real estate, cars, retirement benefits, stocks, bonds, cash, bank accounts, and anything else of value.The division of property must be “equitable.” This means that the property should be divided fairly, not necessarily equally. A court will decide whether your division is equitable by considering the duration of the marriage, the contribution of each spouse to the marriage, and the economic circumstances.A form approved by the Florida Supreme Court is here.  You must file in the circuit court for the county where you last lived as a married couple or in the county where either party currently resides., You initiate divorce proceedings by filing a petition in the court. In the petition, you ask the court for the divorce. Either spouse may file.The Florida Supreme Court has approved various petition forms for divorces: a divorce without children or property (here), a divorce with property but no children (here), or a divorce with children (here).  You will also have to fill out an Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, a Marital Settlement Agreement, Notice of Social Security Number, Family Law Financial Affidavit, and Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure.   If you have children or the wife is pregnant, then you must also file the following forms: the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, and a Parenting Plan.All of these forms are available at this website.  You (or your attorney) should take the petition as well as any supporting documentation and file it with the clerk of court. You will also have to pay a fee, which varies depending on the court.   For example, the fee in Hillsborough County is $408.00.If you cannot afford the filing fee, ask for an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk., You must give your spouse notice that you have filed a petition for dissolution of marriage so that he or she can answer the petition within 20 days.The most common methods of service are personal service and constructive service. You cannot serve by mail or hand delivery.If you know where you spouse is, you should serve the papers personally. You should fill out a Summons and a Process Service Memorandum. You will need your spouse’s home and work address. You will then need to ask the clerk to help schedule service by the sheriff. If your spouse lives in the same county as where the court is located, then you can have the local sheriff serve notice for a fee. The fee can only be paid with cashier’s check or a money order.You must also include a self-addressed stamped envelope.After service, the sheriff will send proof of service to you. If your spouse lives in a different county, then the clerk will send the papers to the sheriff in the other county.Personal service is recommended. Constructive service (by publication) is available if you cannot locate your spouse or if he or she lives in a different state. Talk to the clerk, as your remedies will be limited if you do not personally serve the spouse., To use the simplified divorce procedure, you must meet specific requirements. If you cannot satisfy the requirements, then you must file for regular divorce. The prerequisites are:You and your spouse agree the marriage cannot be saved. You cannot have any minor or dependent children from the marriage, and the wife cannot be pregnant. You and your spouse have worked out how you will divide marital property as well as financial liabilities. Neither spouse is seeking alimony. One party must have been a Florida resident for 6 months. You are willing to give up your right to a trial and an appeal.  You should visit your court’s Self-Help center and purchase a divorce packet. This packet has all of the forms you will need. It should cost around $65.   The Self-Help center keeps regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:00 am-4:30 pm). Call your court for specific details. You must bring a photo ID each time you visit the center. Forms are also available free of charge here.  You can have someone at the Self-Help center review your forms, though no one at the center will fill them out for you.   After having them reviewed, you should make copies for each spouse.  A form approved by the Florida Supreme Court for simplified divorces is located here.   In this form, you will list the property (and its value) that each spouse will receive. Property includes cash, stocks, real estate, automobiles, retirement plans, and life insurance benefits. Each party must sign this document in front of a notary.Although you do not have to sign it together, you can both sign it in front of a notary at the court house when you go to file your petition for dissolution of marriage. The agreement does not operate to transfer title. If you need to transfer title to property (such as land), then you will need to get the deed.Similarly, the marital settlement agreement does not change whose name any spousal debts (such as a mortgage) are in.  Both spouses must go to the clerk’s office in order to file. Be sure to each bring a valid photo identification.   Check with the court clerk whether both spouses must go together. Miami-Dade requires that you both attend to file the petition together.However, this is not a requirement of the Florida Supreme Court,so requirements may vary by county. Supply a witness to corroborate residency. The witness must have a valid photo identification. The witness must corroborate that at least one partner has lived in Florida for at least six months. A notarized certificate from the witness, rather than a personal appearance, is acceptable.  The cost of a simplified divorce can vary slightly by county, but should run about $408.Call ahead to find out acceptable methods of payment.	Be sure the marriage is irretrievably broken. Satisfy residency requirements. Take an online class. Think about hiring a lawyer. Come to an agreement on child custody. Draft a marital settlement agreement. Locate the correct court. Draft a dissolution of marriage petition. Fill out additional forms. File the petition. Serve notice on your spouse. Meet the prerequisites. Pick up a divorce packet. Fill out the divorce forms. Fill out a simplified marital settlement agreement. File the divorce application with the clerk of court. Pay a filing fee.
If you plan to purchase debt as a business venture, it may be best to start your own factoring business, or accounts receivables financing company.Factors are businesses that buy companies’ accounts receivable at a discounted rate (the money owed to a company by its debtors) and attempt to collect the debt for a profit.They are sought out by companies that need additional cash flow in order to maintain their business.A factoring company purchases a company's accounts receivable for a discount of the amount owed. It makes profits by collecting interest on the outstanding balances of the accounts purchased as well as the difference between the discounted value and the amount collected.  If you are new to the factoring business, you may want to attend factoring training workshops run by those in the factoring profession. These workshops may provide you with critical skills to run your business successfully. You can locate these training sessions by conducting an internet search for “factoring training courses.”  , Once you have established your factoring business, it is important that you locate clients. You can do this by advertising your business, which includes using social media.   You may also want to consider joining a factoring business association, which may provide you with networking opportunities.  Businesses that need an inflow of cash will look to factoring business to purchase their accounts receivable. Once you have identified a potential client, you should evaluate their accounts receivable. In order to determine whether the debt is a sound investment, consider the following:   Determine whether their invoices are easily collectable. In order for this to be a good investment, you must be able to collect on the outstanding invoices. Review the accounts receivable and evaluate whether the individuals or businesses have the resources to pay off their debts. Determine whether the assets of the debtor are already encumbered. If the accounts receivable is full of businesses or individuals with liens or claims against their assets, it may not be a sound investment. You can determine whether assets are subject to any liens or claims (also referred to as an “encumbered asset”) by conducting a public records search. Determine whether the potential client has properly managed their accounts receivable. It is important to be able to easily take over and manage the accounts receivable. If the client has not properly maintained their database, it may be difficult to collect on the debts., Once you have determined that a company’s accounts receivable are collectable and appear to be a sound investment, you can make an offer to purchase the company’s accounts receivable.   Typically, a finance company would purchase a business’ accounts receivable in two installments. The first usually covers 70 to 90% of the gross value of the outstanding invoices. The second payment, for the remainder of the gross value minus financing fees, is made when the customers pay their invoices in full. Financing fees are generally between 1.5 and 3.5 percent per 30 days and depend on a variety of factors including your industry and customer creditworthiness.A factoring business buys the accounts receivable at a discount and charges a fee for collecting on the invoices. This allows the factor to make a profit on the purchase of the accounts receivables., In contrast to factoring, accounts receivable financing allows the borrower to take out a loan against the value of their accounts receivable. In other words, the borrower pays back the lender directly, like in a normal loan, rather than signing over the rights to collect on their accounts. This reduces risk for the lender because they don't have to worry about collecting on unpaid accounts. Consider this as a less-risky alternative to offering factoring.Keep in mind that this lower risk also generally translates into lower interest rates paid to you as the lender.	Start a factoring company. Attend training workshops. Advertise your factoring business. Evaluate a potential client’s accounts receivables. Buy the accounts receivable. Consider offering account receivable financing.
The best soaps for polyurethane floors are mild, pH-neutral ones. For instance, you can simply use a capful of dishwashing soap or Murphy Oil Soap in a bucket of water.You can also use soaps specifically made for polyurethane hardwood floors.  Once the solution is mixed together, dip your mop in. A sponge mop or microfiber mop works best, since they aren't as likely to scratch the coating. However, any fairly soft mop will work., You want to apply as little water to the floor as possible, since standing water on the floor's surface is damaging. Squeeze out as much water from the mop as you can. Plus, you won't have as much water to clean up if you wring more thoroughly., Mop the floor, following the grain of the wood. Following the grain will make it less likely that you'll leave streaks on the floor. Make sure to get as little water on the floor as you can. Also, change out the mopping solution if it gets dirty., Once you're done, it can help to go over the area with a soft microfiber cloth. You can also use a dry microfiber mop to help pick up any extra moisture, as standing water can damage the floor.	Mix up a solution of soap and water. Get your mop wet. Wring out the mop completely. Use a damp mop on the floor. Dry the area.
For most floors, one or two gallons of water will suffice. If you need to clean a larger area, you can add an extra couple gallons incrementally. The warmer the water, the better it will be for loosening stuck-on dirt and grime.Before you start mopping, make sure you've cleared the floor of all removable furniture, appliances and other objects that might get in the way or be damaged by water. If the bucket is too big to fit under the sink, try filling it your bathtub.; , Aim for a ratio of roughly ½ to 1 cup of vinegar for every gallon of water. Swish the vinegar solution gently to make sure it’s blended. Vinegar is mildly acidic, which makes it useful for dissolving hardened residue. Diluting the vinegar will prevent it from bleaching the color or wearing down the finish of your floor tiles. Other high-potency types of vinegar, such as apple cider vinegar, will also get the job done., Work your way across the tiles, mopping in a circular or side-to-side direction. Make sure to spread the vinegar over the entire surface of the floor. Don’t forget to run the mop beneath nearby furniture and along the baseboards.As you mop, you should be able to see the results of the vinegar right away.Be careful not to saturate bordering wood or carpet flooring with the vinegar solution.  Empty the bucket and refill it with clean, warm water. Go back over floor once more, wringing out and rewetting the mop every few feet. This will help clear the tiles of loose residue and any remaining traces of vinegar. Soak up excess water with the mop, a squeegee or an absorbent towel, the allow it to air dry completely.If you skip the rinsing step, the dingy water will dry on the floor, leaving behind streaks and splotches.Making sure that the grout has a chance to dry out is essential for preventing the growth of mold and mildew, which thrive in warm, moist spaces., Use equal quantities of both liquids and shake well to mix. The spray bottle will give you greater control over the application of the vinegar, which will be helpful when cleaning narrow spaces like grout lines.A spray bottle of vinegar is a convenient natural cleaning solution to have around in a pinch.  You won’t need to use much—a thin dusting will be fine. Work the baking soda into the grout using your fingertips or the bristles of a brush. For maximum efficiency, proceed in small squares, following the gridlike pattern of the grout a few feet at a time.For particularly bad stains, you can also mix up a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the grout and leave it to take effect overnight., Together, the two ingredients will start a mild chemical reaction, creating a fizzy foam that will bubble over the grout. Allow the baking soda and vinegar to sit for 5-10 minutes to ensure that it’s had time to eat away at the worst of the buildup.This foaming action will make it much easier for the vinegar and baking soda combination to penetrate down into the tiny pores of the grout. To get the most out of the mixture’s stain-lifting power, wait until the foaming has died down before you begin scrubbing., Using a stiff-bristled brush, scour the grout and space between the edges of the tiles forcefully. After the vinegar and baking soda treatment, you should be able to lift out even the heaviest stains. Once you’re finished, give the floor a thorough rinse using a wet rag or sponge, then leave it to air dry.Special brushes designed for cleaning grout can be bought cheap at all home improvement stores. Alternatively, you might also use a long-handled kitchen dish scrubber. Repurpose an old toothbrush and use it to clean grout. The narrow head of the brush coupled with the long handle make it the perfect tool for getting down into the spaces between tiles. Scrubbing grout by hand can be time-consuming, but it’s without a doubt the most effective means of restoring it to its original color.  When it comes to maintaining tile, the best solution is prevention. By sweeping, vacuuming and polishing your flooring on a consistent basis, there will be less chance of stain-causing substances accumulating underfoot. Be on the lookout for places where dirt and debris have a tendency to collect, especially in corners, beneath furniture and around the baseboards.Aim to sweep or vacuum your tile floors every couple of days, and to mop or give them a more extensive wipedown about once a week.Neglected tile will quickly begin to advertise itself. If you allow it to get bad enough, it may even negatively affect the value of your home.  When left untreated, even the smallest spill can become a stubborn stain. As promptly as possible, blot the affected area with a clean cloth dampened with warm water or a small amount of vinegar solution. Tracked-in dirt and food particles should be swept up so they don’t get ground into grout or rough surfaces.Gradually apply more vinegar as need until the stain begins to come out. Responding to messes quickly is especially important if you have light-colored tile or grout that make discoloration more noticeable., Tile is praised for its durability and ease of cleaning, but it’s not indestructible. Harsh chemicals like bleach can cause natural materials to fade, while astringent cleaners may ruin the smooth finish of porcelain tiles after only a few uses. Whenever possible, opt for mild green alternatives such as vinegar and baking soda instead.Even commercial tile cleaners can take their toll when used frequently, and are usually no more effective than garden variety vinegar, anyway. Never use anything more abrasive than a stiff-bristled brush or kitchen sponge to scrub your tile floors. Doing so may leave behind small scratches in which dirt and mildew can set up for good.	Fill a bucket with hot water. Add a cup of distilled white vinegar. Mop the tiles with the vinegar solution. Rinse the floor with fresh water. Combine warm water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Sprinkle baking soda along one section of grout lines. Spray the baking soda with the vinegar solution. Scrub the grout clean. Clean tile floors regularly. Wipe up spills and messes right away. Avoid using chemical cleaners.
To create a 3D video, you need two different videos layered on top of each other. One video is tinted red and the other video is tinted cyan. You’re looking for video editing software that can duplicate and tint videos.These are popular softwares:   Final Cut Pro Adobe’s Premiere Cyberlink Corel Magix; , Upload the video you are attempting to three -dimensionalize. All softwares have their own protocols for importing video. This is typically found under file/import off of the menu bar.  Not every software will allow you to duplicate footage. Make sure you are using a software that can handle two videos on top of each other. Manage your layers and be sure you can go back and forth between videos easily., Select one of your layers and adjust the color so that the color is red. Then select the other layer and color it cyan. When doing this you won’t instantly see the 3D effect., Opacity is also referred to as transparency. You’ll need to adjust the top layer of the video’s opacity. This will create a blend of the colors. Set the top layer to 50%., Now you will need to adjust the position of the top video layer. This will create the classic 3D image that you see without wearing 3D glasses.   You can use your 3D glasses to help guide the positioning. The top layer does not need to be too heavily adjusted, but far enough so that there is a dizzying effect. Once the position is correctly aligned, you’ll be able tell using your glasses.

If you have the kind of job that you can do absolutely anywhere as long as you have a computer, try taking your work to a coffee shop one day a week and see how it feels. If you feel more focused and organized in this type of work environment, and less tempted to do chores or text your friends, then maybe this is a better work environment for you than your actual home.   Working in a coffee shop, library, or another place where people are also working can also be good for your mental state. You will feel less isolated and more part of a working community.  Though you may spend all day at work online, don't get distracted by checking your email, Facebook, favorite news sources, or any other favorite websites too often. Though you may not think that clicking on your five favorite websites every five minutes is making you lose time, that time not only adds up, but keeps you from fully focusing on your tasks.   Reward yourself by letting yourself browse the Internet every hour or so, when you need a break. If you really need your email to stay connected at work, then leave it open, but if you don't get any urgent messages, try to check it every half hour or hour or so.  Do not chat with your friends while you're working. This will slow you down exponentially.  Though you may think that multi-tasking will help you get more things done and finish your work day faster, you'll actually be more focused if you complete one type of work at a time. Go down your to-do list one item at a time, and you'll be shocked by how much faster you'll get things done than if you try to finish four things at once.   If you're multi-tasking, you'll never be fully engrossed in one task and will be more likely to get distracted and to make a mistake.  Taking a break from time to time will actually help you stay focused. Let's face it -- no one spends eight hours straight working in an office, and neither should you. You should do something to take a sanity break every hour, whether it's to munch on an apple, take a short walk, or just read on your porch and breathe in some fresh air. Taking breaks will actually make you more focused when you do get back to work.Try to go out for lunch or to pick up lunch as often as you can. Though you may spend some money paying for lunch, getting into this routine will help you stay refreshed and will split up your work day. Make a goal of leaving the house at least once a day. You'll start to get cabin fever if you don't leave your house at all. Rest your eyes. If you've been staring at a monitor all day, take at least a five-minute break to rest your eyes to avoid straining them and getting a headache.	Change your environment to avoid getting distracted. Don't spend too much time browsing the Internet. Avoid multi-tasking. Take occasional breaks.
The process is GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding), commonly known as MIG welding (Metal Inert Gas welding). MIG welding was developed during World War II as a fast, portable process to create strong, durable joints. Today it is used in many shop and factory applications as well as by home hobbyists and welding enthusiasts.; , MIG welding uses a machine to feed a wire through a contact tip into a MIG gun. The electrically charged contact tip transfers the welding current to the wire. The arc is established between the wire and the base metal. Often times an inert gas is used, which flows out of the gas nozzle to shield the welding process from the atmosphere. There are several modes of metal transfer:   Short circuit (thin metals) Globular transfer (heavier metals) Spray transfer (hottest)  , Once you learn how to use a MIG welder, you can make repairs around the home. A MIG welder can be used on stainless steel, mild steel, and aluminium of all thicknesses. Shielding gases will vary depending on base metal and welding wire.	Learn the basics of MIG welding. Learn how it works. Understand the applications.
Another type of debt investment is to provide financing for a purchaser to buy an asset, such as property that you own. Private lending agreements can be made for any type of asset purchase. These loans are typically backed by the borrower's assets, giving the lender the right to seize those assets in the event that they default. These loans can be taken out by businesses or by individuals.For buyers that have difficulty obtaining a traditional mortgage, private lending may provide them the only opportunity for home ownership. As the seller, you can retain the deed until certain conditions are met and receive a steady cash flow while the buyer meets his or her obligations., Once you have located a potential borrower, be sure that the buyer completes a detailed loan application. You should verify that all of the information provided is correct and run a credit check on the potential buyer.For mortgage loans, you can download a Uniform Mortgage Loan application at: http://www.freddiemac.com/uniform/pdf/form65.pdf.  You should check local or market interest rates when determining the rate at which you plan to finance the loan. Keep in mind that secured loans often offer a lower interest rate because the lender is protected by their right to seize the borrower's property in the event of a default.  You may want to consider hiring an attorney to draft the loan agreement for you. If you choose to draft the agreement yourself, make sure that you comply with all state laws. You can search your state’s laws at: https://www.law.cornell.edu/statutes.html. Generally, your agreement should include:   The loan amount, the date that payments are due, the length of the contract, signatures of all of the parties, and the amount of the down payment (if you are lending for a mortgage). You should specify that the secured asset is held as collateral for the loan and that you can seize that asset if the buyer fails to meet his or her obligations. For a mortgage loan, you can consider requiring a balloon payment. Rather than financing the property over 30 years, you can require that the seller make a significant payment at the end of a fixed period. This is referred to as a balloon payment. By that time, the seller should qualify for a traditional mortgage and be able to pay off their debt to you.	Provide a direct loan. Provide a loan application. Negotiate the terms of the loan.

If you are keeping your clothes in a container overnight, you can help them stay smelling good by just using a bar of soap. Carefully fold your clothes into the container, and then place a breathable cloth, such as a napkin or a thin tablecloth, over the top of the clothes. Get a sweet-smelling soap bar that you like, and place this on top of the breathable cloth.   Put the lid back on the container, and leave it. The clothes should have absorbed the smell of the soap after around four hours. Try out a few different soaps to see which one you like the most. Lavender and lemon are good choices to start with.You could repeat this method with a drawer rather than a storage container.  Making a small sachet or a nice smelling herb and adding to the container or draw where you store your clothes overnight will help you wake up to fresh smelling clothes. You can buy small sachets of potpourri, but you can also make your own at home. Get a few small cotton bags that are breathable.   Then fill them will dried herbs that you like the smell of, and put them in the drawer or container. Lavender is a popular choice, and you can also try lemongrass.Experiment with some different scents to find the one that works best for you.  Dryer sheets are a tried and tested way to keep clothes smelling nice and fresh when they are being stored. If you have a big drawer or container full of clothes add a dryer sheet between each layer to help keep them fresh and smelling good.You can also just place one dryer sheet at the bottom of each drawer or container. Adding a dryer sheet to your suitcase is also great for keeping clothes fresh when travelling., You could opt for getting especially designer drawer liners to help keep clothes fresh overnight. These work in the same way as the dryer sheets, but they are generally scented and designed to last for longer. You will find these in department and homeware stores, and they come in a range of fragrances.	Use a soap bar. Use herb sachets. Try dryer sheets. Consider draw liners.
If you had a successful meeting with the representative of the rescue organization, you’ll need to finalize the deal by signing a contract. This makes you the legal owner of the cat, and delineates certain protocols you’ll need to adhere to once you adopt. These protocols vary from one rescue organization to another.For instance, you might need to contact the rescue organization before putting the cat up for adoption You might be required to acknowledge that you understand that cat ownership is a 15-20 year commitment of both time and money. Many rescue shelters will demand that you not declaw your cat.  Along with signing the contract, you’ll need to pay a fee to obtain the cat from a rescue organization. The fee to obtain the cat will depend on its age and the number of cats you adopt. Older cats are typically less expensive to obtain than kittens. And if you adopt two cats at the same time, you might qualify for a per-cat discount.The fee varies depending on the rescue organization you select. Prepare to pay $50- $200 for a single cat.  If you rent your home or apartment, you’ll typically have to demonstrate that your landlord permits you to own a cat. This might be a copy of your rental contract and your landlord’s phone number, or it might be a letter from your landlord explicitly stating that cats are allowed.	Fill out an adoption contract. Pay a fee. Provide proof that your landlord allows cats.
Find a flat, dry area that is several yards from any open water. Self-supporting nets are like tents, so you can find a spot that you would feel comfortable setting up a tent on.If you’re inside, find a spot where you will feel the most comfortable and that has enough room for the net.; , Remove the net, as well as any rods, strings, and stakes, from its bag. Separate the net from the other parts., Spread the net over the area you have chosen. Pull the stake loops on the ends of the tent out to the corners of your sleeping area.If your net has a base, it will be easy to tell if you have it right-side up. If not, check to make sure any zippers are on top of the net.  The poles will be broken into small sections that are connected with an elastic rope. Connect the sections together to form the full length of the pole.If you have polls of different lengths, separate them so you don’t accidentally start to use a short poll where a long poll is needed.  Depending on the particular net you have, there will either be fabric sleeves or clips that hold the polls in place. The polls will extend from one stake loop, over the top of the tent, and connect to the stake loop on the opposite side of the net.If you have a rectangular net, you will most likely have two long polls that cross each other in an X shape at the top of the net. On more elaborate nets, there may be a space for a smaller poll that holds the entryway of the net up.  Using the included stakes, or sticks if no stakes are included with the net, stake the tent to the ground by hammering the stakes into each corner of the net. There will be loops on the corner of the tent that the stakes pass through.If you’re inside, you don’t need to stake the net to the ground.  Keep it away from the edges of the net since mosquitoes can bite through the net if your skin is touching the edges., Make sure every zipper is closed completely. Otherwise, smaller mosquitoes may be able to get through.	Locate a suitable area for your net. Unpack the net. Lay out the net. Connect the poles. Insert the polls into the net. Stake the net to the ground. Place your sleeping bag or mattress inside the net. Close all of the zippers.
Flush the flask with clean water. Dump the water down the drain and refill it with a moderate amount of clean water. Insert a small amount (roughly a handful) of uncooked rice to the water. Add a few drops of a mild detergent, like dish soap.In place of uncooked rice, you can substitute crushed eggshells. Boil an egg to clean the shells. Peel the egg and crush the shells with your clean hands. Add these to the flask in the same fashion and amount as uncooked rice., Cap the flask firmly to prevent leaking. Use a variety of motions while shaking the flask: swirl the solution back and forth, tip the bottle upside down and rightside up. Using firm motions will clean the inside best., Dump the cleaning solution outside or down a drain. Rinse the flask thoroughly to remove any remaining rice (or eggshells) and soap. Inspect the flask for remaining dirtiness. If it is still dirty, repeat this process.  When clean, air dry the flask for about eight hours or overnight, then store the flask uncapped. This will prevent your flask from developing an unpleasant odor.	Add water, uncooked rice, and a mild detergent to the flask. Shake the flask thoroughly. Empty the flask and rinse it.
This design calls for a one-foot section of two-inch diameter PVC tubing, an end cap for the two-inch PVC, PVC glue, superglue, velcro, a spring, plastic discs, a paint can opener, a drill, a ruler, and plenty of ammunition.  The best springs for this design are long, medium coil tension springs such as those found on the inside of the “snakes” in practical joke canisters that spring out when opened. Superglue this spring directly to the center of the PVC end cap., You can easily cut this plastic disc out of something household such as an empty laundry detergent bottle. Most importantly, cut the disc with a 1.5” diameter so that it can easily fit flat down the PVC tube. Center this disc on the opposite end of the spring and attach it with more superglue.  You want to test how deep you can coil the spring into the tube before drilling the first hole, so fit the end cap onto the tube without gluing it and push the plastic disc all the way down with a ruler. Use that to gauge how far the spring coils down the tube, and drill the first hole in the tube one-half inch more shallow than the depressed disc. Drill the second hole at the opposite end of the tube about one inch from the end.   each hole perforate both sides of the tube in a perfectly straight line.Use a drill bit large enough so that you can insert the paint can opener through the holes., Once you have your holes drilled, you can glue the end cap holding the spring into place on the tube.You’ll want to give the glue thirty minutes to dry before testing the launcher.  To make this launcher resemble an M203 grenade launcher, you can attach it under the barrel of a carbine-style Nerf or Airsoft gun with velcro. Simply peel the plastic backing off a velcro strip and place one end on the tube and the other on the gun.   You can use the wall-safe velcro types, which will even allow you to remove the velcro easily when you want. For select Nerf models such as the Recon, you can use the sight that attaches to the gun and slides off instead. Attach this piece to the tube, and you can clip the launcher to the gun where that slides and locks into place.You can just as easily use this design without it being attached to anything else as well.  Push the spring all the way down, then insert the painter can opener key into the hole drilled into the bottom of the tube. This will hold the spring coiled while you load the launcher.  This design can hold a ton of Nerf darts. Insert the darts in sets of five or six to keep them straight as they drop down the tube. You can place about three of these layers to fill the tube. Once you have loaded the tube, place a second plastic disc with the same diameter as the first one you cut into the tube on top of the ammo load. Hold this disc down while you remove the paint can opener from the bottom set of holes and insert it back into the top set of holes in the top of the barrel.   If you still have some of the old Nerf ball-type ammunition, these fit in the tube and fire effectively as well.  Now you simply have to aim the launcher and pull the paint can opener back out as though it were a firing pin. The high load of ammunition may not explode on impact (obviously), but the spread of the ammunition gives you a much more effective idea of a blast radius.   Just like an M203, the angle of the launcher is how you aim.Practice firing it several times to get a feel for the trajectory of the launch, and then you will be able to aim proficiently in no time.	Gather materials. Superglue the spring to the inside of the PVC end cap. Superglue a plastic disc to the other end of the spring. Drill two holes in the PVC tube. Use the PVC glue to glue the end cap onto the tube. Attach the launcher to your favorite Nerf gun with velcro. Prime the launcher. Load the launcher. Fire the launcher.
If you don't know the rules, you might as well throw your money away. Learning all the rules and nuances of a game helps you understand the odds and bet strategically, not just randomly. Don't trust the casino or other players to explain the rules in a clear and complete way—it may be to their advantage if you miss something. Check out the following articles for more help:   How to Play Craps        How to Play Blackjack        How to Play Poker        How to Play Roulette        How to Play Keno        How to Bet on a Live Horse Race        , Even if you memorize the rules, playing is the best way to really learn how a game works. So before you put any money on the line, get together with friends and play practice hands until you know the rhythm and flow of the game.  This is especially important in poker, where the game is about more than just understanding the rules.  Most games of chance aren't just random—they're statistical. At any given point, some basic math can tell you the probability that you will roll a specific number in craps or flip over one of your "outs" in poker. Learning to make these calculations and playing based on your real odds, not your gut, is the best way to lose less and win more in the long run.  Set rules for how much you can put on the line before you go out gambling and yourself stick to these rules. You can lose a lot of money very quickly if you don't give yourself limits and cut your losses when you hit them.  This can be the hardest part of gambling, especially with games like slots and roulette. Many gamblers will win a few rounds and feel like they are "hot" and can't lose. Don't fall into this trap! Just because you are on a winning streak, doesn't mean the odds are in your favor. In fact, it will make the odds in games like blackjack and poker edge to the casino.  If you do get ahead, that's a great time to take your winnings and leave.       If you keep playing, consider betting more conservatively (like the Kelly bet) instead of less to preserve your profits, because the odds will probably swing back against you sooner rather than later.	Learn the games. Practice. Know the odds. Don't bet the farm. Know when to walk away.
Customer segmentation is a useful tool for a business that has many customers and a wide array of different interactions with each of them. It allows the business to identify the different customer groups that they primarily serve and how they specifically interact with them. Small businesses may have no need to segment customers, especially if they only serve a small, manageable set of them. However, for businesses with more customers, customer segmentation is indispensable., Gather all of your customer information in one place so you know what options you are working with. Ideally you should have your customers set up in an electronic format. If not, invest in contact software that allows you to segment your customer base. Organize your clients in order of descending profit margin.   Use any data you have from customer purchases, such as purchase amounts, addresses, items purchased, and payment methods.Utilize segmentation tools and services to help group your customers. There are many services available that assist in profiling your customer base. They can group your customers into value and lifestyle groups. Placing your customers in such groups allows you to better target them when marketing your product.  To make the distinctions necessary for customer segmentation, you may need to gather some additional customer information beyond what you already have. There are several ways to go about this. First, an industry or trade association relevant to your business might already have demographic information available for your use. Contact the relevant organization(s) to see what customer information they have available.   You can also ask your customers directly. Asking them to provide information to sign up for a giveaway or discount can be an effective way to get the facts you need. If you can't seem to get the information you need, consider hiring an outside consultant to help you., You should not put any customer into more than one segment at a time. Additionally, you should not overlap your segments. Doing either or both will dilute the effects of your marketing efforts. However, this is only true for segments differentiated using the same method. Your customers will be in many different segments when different criteria are used.   For example, don't place a customer in both your "rural" and "urban" categories, but feel free to place them in the "rural" category and the "high-earner" category. These represent different segmentation criteria., You don't want to direct marketing efforts toward a low-volume customer segment that is not worth the effort. Consider the customer count or the dollar value that the customer brings when calculating the value of a segment. If the value is not worthy of the marketing efforts, then don't consider the segment.   For example, if "customers under the age of 20" only constitute 1 percent of your sales, there is no need to allocate an entire segment to them., The simplest way to divide your customers is based upon demographic data. These include how old they are, their occupations, and their levels of education and income. This might also include their gender, marital status, and number of children. Unlike some other criteria, knowing how your customers are split based on these criteria alone is useful.   For example, if your clients are primarily young people, you can make advertising choices to reflect their interests., Create segments that represent different parts of your service area, whether it's a small neighborhood or the whole country. Marketing client segments would also be influenced by factors such as population density, rural versus urban living, and climate. You might also split your customers into domestic and international groups., Divide them into groups depending on which products they buy, how often, and how they purchase each product. Look at customers who have only purchased one item, returning customers, and new customers. You can also separate customers by the amount sales they have contributed to your business (lifetime value).You can also separate customers based on where they purchased your product. For example, customers may buy your products on the computer, on their phone, or at a physical store., Psychographic segmentation is a murkier criterion for separating customers that splits them up based on their lifestyle choices, values, and attitudes. Groups might include customers that strive for "clean" or "green" living, religious customers, or customers that support a certain cause or charity, for example.Psychographic information is best obtained through surveys or focus groups. Psychographic traits may be applied broadly to different generations, such as baby boomers and millennials., This segment considers the ways in which a product is beneficial to the customer. The more benefits a product has, the more places and ways an advertiser can place the product. As a result, the marketing efforts for one product will gain a better response than a single position in the market. Benefits might include a low price, specific features of the product, customer service, or product quality., Segmentation can allow you value each segment of your customer base. This is important, as 80 percent of your sales typically come from only 20 percent of your customers. Identify those groups that provide the highest volume of sales and quantify the total volumes for those groups. These are your high-value segments. You can then use this information to refocus your marketing efforts, prioritize service to this group, and adjust your offerings to more closely meet their needs., Understanding your most important segments can allow you to change your marketing efforts to reach those segments more directly. You can edit your advertising language and message to appeal more clearly to them. You can also change your advertisements for each product line to appeal to the corresponding segments that buy that product line. This allows for fewer wasted advertising dollars., Segmentation can help you see which customer groups are the most profitable for you. You can more easily see which groups go on to do the most business with you and buy the more expensive items or service packages. You can then compare this to the money you spend advertising to them or serving them to assess which are the most profitable. This information will allow you to reassess your customer prioritization and, by doing so, increase your profit margin., Once you know exactly who is buying each of your products or service, you can make changes to them to better appeal to these groups. These changes will make the product more useful and more appealing to the group in question. This, in turn, will give you an advantage over your competitors and may increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.   You can also apply what you learn to your customer support and other products to create a whole customer experience tailored to a particular segment or segments.	Determine whether you need to segment your customers. Organize your current list of customers. Obtain additional customer information. Pick segments that are mutually exclusive. Create segments that are valuable enough to market. Divide your customers into demographic groups. Separate clients based on location. Segment each contact by identifying product purchasing histories. Opt for psychographic segmentation. Consider dividing customers into benefit groups. Value each segment. Focus your marketing efforts. Prioritize different segments. Improve your offerings.
Because warranty deeds are the most complicated method of transferring the title to your property, you most likely will want an attorney to guide you through the process.   Warranty deeds, sometimes called grant deeds, come with a guarantee to the new property owner that you have good title to the property and no one else has any stake in it or claim to it.Because they are so complicated, warranty deeds typically aren’t used to transfer a house to a family member when no money is exchanged. Although complicated for you, a warranty deed gives the relative to whom you’re transferring your property more confidence, because you promise that you own the property free and clear of any mortgages or other encumbrances, and that no one else has a competing claim for the property.  Before you complete a warranty deed, a title search reviews the legal history of the property ensure the statements in the deed are correct and the title to the property is clean. This process can be expensive and time consuming.   Although you can conduct a title search yourself, since property records are open to the public, a professional title searcher will do a more thorough job in less time than it would take you to do it yourself.Title insurance provides better protection against any defects in your title, either disclosed or hidden, that could cloud your deed with problems or even negate your transfer. Title insurance is expensive, and typically the cost is split between the original owner and the future owner., As with other types of deeds, your deed will provide details about you and the family member to whom you’re transferring your title, as well as a complete and detailed legal description of the property. ,, This is technically your family member’s responsibility, but if you’ve hired an attorney to draw up the deed, she may offer to record the deed herself.   The deed is still valid if it isn’t recorded, but failure to record it can cause significant problems later on because no one else will be aware of your relative’s claim to your property. Not recording the deed would eliminate all the gains you made by transferring your deed, including your attempt to avoid probate.	Contact a real estate attorney.

Many types of topical preventatives act as a flea repellent. This protects your pet by repelling fleas and ticks from them. It keeps them off your pet in the first place. Oral preventatives do not offer any repelling properties.An oral preventative only works if the flea bites the animal or is on the pet.; , Oral medications are often chosen due to their convenience. With an oral preventative, you don’t have to worry about a drying period where the pesticide can transfer to children or other pets. Once the pet swallows the medication, you are finished.Some oral preventatives only kill the eggs or adult fleas, but not both. You may need an additional preventative if your oral tablet only focuses on one threat.Be aware that your pet may refuse to swallow the oral medication or may spit it out after you place it in their mouth. Even if you place it in their food, they may eat around it. Some brands of oral preventatives come in flavored chewable tablets, like beef flavored., Collars are a different kind of topical preventative. Collars are easy to use because you put them on your pet and they are protected. Most collars kill and repel fleas. With collars, you have to make sure no one touches the collar, especially children, since it contains the chemical preventative.Collars may be less effective for fleas because fleas generally live close to the bottom of the body, around the rear area, instead of near the head where the collar will be.Collars may have a strong, unpleasant odor. They may also irritate your pet’s neck or skin.  You may be interested in other types of topical preventatives, such as sprays, powders, and shampoos. Sprays, powders, and shampoos work immediately to kill fleas, but they do not protect your pet from reinfestation and do not repel fleas.Powders generally last for about a week and shampoos last for a day.Sprays generally last for up to a month, but your pet cannot get wet. This includes swimming, baths, or rain.If you want ongoing protection from fleas, consider something stronger than these products.  If you are not sure what kind of flea preventative to give your pet, talk to your vet. Flea preventatives are a type of medication, which means if your pet already takes medication or has existing health issues, the preventative may interfere. Discuss which type and brand of preventative will be best for your pet with the veterinarian before choosing one.The age, breed, and species of your pet may also influence what you give your pet.	Use topical preventative to repel fleas. Choose an oral preventative for convenience. Try a collar. Think about other types of topical products. Talk to your vet.
Deferred revenue is an aspect of what is called the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded on the income statement when they are earned rather than received.This contrasts with the cash basis of accounting wherein the opposite is true., Accrual-based accounting requires you to defer unearned revenue because of a principle called the revenue recognition principle. The revenue recognition principle requires accountants to show revenues on the income statement in the period in which they are earned, not in the period when the cash is collected.This requires a differentiation between realized and earned revenue. Realized revenue is revenue received regardless of whether the company has fulfilled its obligations to the purchaser. Realized yet unearned revenue is the subset of revenue which must be deferred.For instance, say a magazine company receives a twelve-month subscription for a monthly publication. The subscription costs $120, and the subscriber pays the entire cost of the subscription up front. Thus, before the company delivers any magazines to the customer, the $120 is classified as deferred revenue and represents a liability to the company. In other words, the revenue has been realized but not yet earned.  Deferred revenue deals with revenue realized in one reporting period but earned in the next. The reporting period can be monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the company. Identify all customer orders as of the reporting period end date that have not been fulfilled, yet for which the company has already received payment. Report any transaction meeting this criteria as deferred revenue.This includes items that have been paid in full but await shipment, as well as subscription-based revenues where the subscription period is still ongoing. Once these transactions have been identified, the accounting staff must calculate and record the amount of the deferral.  Recording deferred revenue applies to the company’s balance sheet. The company receives cash (an asset account on the balance sheet) and records deferred revenue (a liability account on the balance sheet).In the example from Part 1, the company receives a $120 advance payment relating to a twelve-month magazine subscription. When the company receives payment (but before delivering the subscription), the company must record the entire amount of the payment as deferred revenue. To do this, the accounting staff will post the following journal entry:  Debit Cash $120 Credit Deferred Revenue ($120)    , This journal entry affects the balance sheet and the income statement. This entry essentially updates the entry in the previous step by reducing the balance sheet liability and transferring the amount to the income statement.Consider the magazine subscription example. After the first month of the subscription, $10 ($120 / 12) of revenue has been earned and the deferred revenue amount is now $110. The accounting staff will transfer $10 from the deferred revenue account to the earned revenue account using the journal entry below:  Debit Deferred Revenue $10 Credit Subscription Revenue ($10)    , The company’s accountants must keep adjusting the balance sheet and income sheet over the course of the service.The adjusting entries will continue until the company has fulfilled its obligation of goods or services and the liability to the customer reaches zero.   Using the previous example, at that time, the deferred revenue account will have a balance of $0, and $120 of revenue will have been recognized.	Familiarize yourself with the accrual basis of accounting. Understand why you need to defer revenue. Identify transactions involving deferred revenue. Record the deferred revenue. Record the earned revenue. Continue adjusting the ledger until all the revenue is earned.
If the ink or dye is fresh, then you may be able to remove it using just a clean, damp cloth.Try to wipe the dye or ink away in one motion, and then go back over the spot with a clean section of the cloth.   Use your fingertip to help you clean a small area. Wrap the cloth over your fingertip and use it to rub the dyed or ink-covered area. You can also try adding a small amount of dish soap to the water. Be sure to wipe the wall with water only after wiping it with soapy water. Use a clean, smooth cloth first and then try a more abrasive cloth or a sponge if that does not work. Don’t use an abrasive cloth if you don’t have to. Avoid using too much water when you wipe down your walls.Wet the cloth and then wring out excess water so that the cloth feels damp.; , A pencil eraser is a safe, gentle way to remove ink and dye stains from a painted wall without removing the paint. You can also control the area that you are cleaning more easily than some other cleaning methods.Be sure to use a clean pencil eraser. Rub the pencil eraser gently over the dyed or ink-covered areas of the wall only.  Baking soda is great for removing stains from surfaces, however it is a slightly abrasive option, so be careful when trying this method. You can make a baking soda paste by mixing a tablespoon of baking soda with one to two tablespoons of water.To use baking soda paste to clean a wall, apply it to the dyed or ink-covered area using a cotton ball, clean cloth, old toothbrush, or a sponge. Then, gently rub the dyed areas only. Use a clean wet cloth to wipe away the excess baking soda. You may need to repeat this method a few times before it removes the dye completely.	Wipe with a clean, damp cloth. Try a pencil eraser. Make a baking soda paste.
Use a solvent like window cleaner, rubbing alcohol, drain cleaner, bleach or vinegarto dissolve the wax and separate it from the glass surface, making it easy to remove.  Spray or pour the solvent on the waxy area until it begins to dissolve.  Use a damp cloth or a soft sponge to wipe the wax off the table.  Use a flat, dragging motion instead of dabbing at the wax. Repeat application of the solvent and wiping until the wax buildup is gone.  Spray the area with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a lint-free cloth.	Dissolve the wax. Remove the wax. Clean the glass.
Hazardous waste cannot be disposed like normal trash in landfills. Instead it must be disposed through the proper networks to prevent human and environmental harm. Look at the four characteristics of hazardous waste:   Ignitability means that the waste can easily catch on fire. It is considered flammable if the flash point is less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Corrosive wastes are acids/bases that are capable of corroding metal containers. Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases or vapors when heated. Toxic types of wastes are potentially fatal or harmful when absorbed or ingested. They can pollute groundwater if not disposed of properly.; , Responsibility in disposing these types of wastes isn’t just for your carbon footprint. Many counties and states attach legal responsibility towards disposing hazardous waste.   Companies who don’t adhere to the laws are subject to fines and other legal action.  Many counties across the U.S. have specific protocol for disposing hazardous waste. Each county can have different steps and regulations for disposing hazardous waste. The actual disposal of hazardous waste on the local level is enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is common to come into contact with hazardous waste without ever knowing it. Take a look at the following list of common products that shouldn’t be thrown away normally:   Automotive products. This includes antifreeze, fluids, motor oils, and gasoline. Batteries Fluorescent light bulbs. Many of the older models contain mercury. Household cleaners. This includes ammonia, drain cleaner, and rust remover. Paint products. Garden chemicals. Swimming pool chemicals.	Understand hazardous waste. Be responsible with your waste. Research your local laws. Recognize everyday hazardous products.
These moves are all reliable and common:   1.e4       1.d4       1.c4       1.Nf3      ; ,, Try developing by giving threat to your opponent so that his/her move is wasted while defending. Meanwhile, you can develop your own piece in your next move.   Keep an eye on controlling the center with your pieces. The center is the place where most of the action will be. Develop with gain of time by attacking your opponents unguarded pieces and pawns.  For example, a bishop is bad if it is trapped by pawns of the same color as the bishop. If your center pawns are on white squares and your bishop is trapped behind them, try to exchange the bishop for a well-placed piece of your opponent's.  You might beat beginners with early mates, but not masters. So develop, rather than attempting premature attacks.   Don't go pawn hunting in the opening (unless it is a center pawn) because it wastes time and will probably put you in an underdeveloped position that is very hard to defend.  Nf3 Nc6 3.

Each credit reporting agency has a unique format for its reports. However, they all report the same categories of information. These categories include identifying information, information about credit accounts and credit inquiries, public record and collections items, satisfactory accounts and negative items., This includes the person's name, social security number, date of birth and employment information. If the person's name has changed for any reason, such as a marriage or divorce, previous names will be listed here. Also, any nicknames or variations on the person's name will be included. Current and previous addresses are also listed., These are also referred to as trade lines. Lenders report all information about credit accounts. This information includes the type of account, the date the account was opened, the credit limit, the loan amount, the account balance, and the person's payment history. Three different types of credit accounts exist.Mortgage accounts include first and second mortgages, home equity loans and any other loans secured by real estate. Revolving accounts are charge accounts with a credit limit that must be paid each month. Credit cards are an example of revolving accounts. Installment accounts are credit accounts in which the amount and number of payments is predetermined in a fixed amount. Car loans are installment accounts.  A hard inquiry occurs when the person requests a loan and the creditor checks the person's credit score. A soft inquiry occurs when a lender is not reviewing the person's credit for the purposes of granting a loan. Examples of soft inquiries include a person requesting his own credit score and credit checks made by businesses for the purposes of promotional offers. Credit inquiries may have a negative effect on a person's credit score., The credit report includes information in the public record. State and county courts and collection agencies report information about overdue debt. Examples of public record financial information includes bankruptcies, foreclosures, liens and judgments., All three credit reporting agencies separate positive and negative items on credit reports. This makes it easier to interpret the information. In the section detailing negative items, you will find information about late payments. This includes when a late payment occurred, how late it was, the balance on the account, and whether the account was written-off or submitted to collections., Each credit reporting agency has its own set of codes for payment history, public records and credit check history. Understanding these codes makes it easier to interpret the credit report.Visit the Merit Credit Engine to learn about the Experian, TransUnion and Equifax credit report formats and codes.

In order to play the game, make sure you use a standard 52 card deck. Make sure to count the deck ahead of time to make sure no cards are missing. You'll need all 52 to properly divide the deck for a game of speed.; , You and your partner will each have a stock pile of cards you draw from throughout the game. You should count out 20 cards for yourself, and 20 cards for your partner. When you need new cards during the game, you'll draw from your stockpile.Some variations of speed may use 15 card stockpiles instead of 20 card stockpiles.It does not make a huge difference in the game, but if you find you and your partner go through cards fast, a bigger stockpile may make more sense.  The "spit cards" are two cards set out in the middle of the table. These are the cards you'll be playing off of when the game begins. As you learn more about how the game works, this will make more sense. Before the game starts, the spit cards should be face down at the center of the table. Take 2 cards and place them face down side-by-side at the center of the table where you're playing speed., At certain points in the game, you will have to draw new spit cards. You will need reserve piles from which to draw the new cards. On either side of each spit card, set down 5 cards face down. These are your reserve piles.If you're using 15 cards in your stockpiles instead of 20, your reserve piles would consist of 10 cards each.As stated, the number of cards in your stock and reserve piles does not make a huge difference to game play.  You and your partner should always have at least 5 cards in your hand. Before the game begins, you should each draw 5 cards from your separate stockpiles. Do not let your partner see your cards.It's a good idea to take a moment to familiarize yourself with your cards. You and your partner may want to take a minute or so to look through and organize your cards.  In speed, you focus on the number on a card. Suit is not important for speed. You have to play your cards in ascending or descending order, so it's important to know the proper numerical order of cards. When playing speed, the order of cards is as follows: aces, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens, eights, nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings.It's a good idea to organize your deck in ascending or descending order, as this will come in handy when the game begins. For example, say you have a jack, a queen, a two, an eight, and a seven. From left to right, order your cards like this: two, seven, eight, jack, queen. This may sound confusing, but the rules will become clearer as we go over a typical game of speed.  To start the game, flip over the two spit cards in the center. You will be playing off of these cards as the game starts. Once you flip over the card, you and your partner simply play cards as fast you can, striving to get rid of your hand. You do not take turns, so be prepared to start playing once you flip the spit cards.  Now, you can begin to play. The object of speed is to get rid of all your cards, including your stockpile, before your opponent. You play by placing cards from your hand on top of the spit card in the center. You can only play the next highest or next lowest card on top of the spit card.This can be confusing when speaking in the abstract, so let's return to our example. You have a two, seven, eight, jack, and queen in your hand. You flip over the spit cards. One spit card is a six and the other is a queen. You can get rid of three cards in your deck quickly. You can place your seven over the six, and then your eight over the seven. On the six spit card, you are working in ascending order. You can work in descending order on the other spit card, by placing your jack over the queen. However, you do not take turns in speed. If you don't play your cards fast enough, you can miss your chance to win. Your partner could very well block your play by working faster than you. For example, while you're placing your seven and eight cards down, your opponent may place his own jack over the queen.  You always have to have 5 cards on hand when playing speed. For each card you set down over the two spit piles in the center, draw a new card from your stockpile., In most games of speed, you'll eventually run into a scenario where you and your partner have run out of plays. This means you and your partner both have 5 cards in your hands, but no cards can be played in the spit pile. In this case, you'll draw two new cards from the reserve pile to serve as the new spit cards.Remember, the reserve piles are the 5 cards stacked face down next to the spit cards in the center. Draw two new cards from the reserve piles and place them on top of each spit pile. You can now resume playing. In the event you and your partner still have no plays after drawing new spit cards, you'll have to draw new spit cards again.  You may eventually run through the spit card reserve pile. In this case, you would take the two spit piles in the center of the table. Turn the piles upside down and draw two new cards from the top of each pile., You win speed by being the first player to go through your stockpile. Keep playing speed until you're completely out of cards. The first player to finish off his or her cards wins.The best strategy to win a game of speed is to think fast. You want to make sure you play any eligible card you have before your partner tops the spit pile. Try to play a few practice rounds of the game first. Just play through one hand of five cards and go slowly, allowing you and your partner to figure out the rules of the game. Speed often sounds complicated at first. It's not a bad idea to practice before attempting an actual game.	Use a deck of 52 cards. Give you and your partner a 20 card stock pile. Set two "spit cards" cards face down in the middle of the table. Set out two reserve piles of 5 cards. Draw 5 cards from your stock pile. Learn the order of the cards. Flip over the 2 cards in the center. Play as many cards as you can. Take new cards as you go. Draw new spit cards when you and your partner run out of plays. Replenish the spit card reserve pile if it runs out. Keep playing until one players goes through all his or her cards.
Talking to a nurse or other medical professional can help tailor your recovery plan to you. A medical professional can also recommend a particular medicine or even call in a prescription to a pharmacy for you.  Do not hesitate to go if your symptoms include a high fever (over 101°F or 38.3°C), chills that make you shake, an inability to keep down food or drinks, and bloody phlegm or mucus. Any of these elements will require more help than you can give yourself at home. , If she gives you a prescription, fill it and take it as long the doctor recommends. If she wants a follow-up visit, schedule it. Even if you think you are feeling a lot better and don’t need that medication or other visit, trust that your medical professional is recommending it for a reason. Don’t hijack your recovery.

Most casinos always "stand" on 17 and greater. Some will "hit" a "soft 17" (any 6 and an ace). Some casinos (though rarely) require an "ante" like in poker (play in those casinos favors the house as much as 20%). You'll quickly gather your casino's rules when you sit down to play.          Casinos have varying rules on insurance, splitting, and doubling down when it comes to how and when you can do it. Your dealer will surely let you know it if comes to this. For example, some casinos won't let you split a third Ace; for surrendering, some abide by early or late surrender only., All of the extra actions favor the house when used incorrectly -- it wouldn't be a casino game if the opposite were true!          When making an insurance bet, you are betting that the dealer's hole card is a 10, Jack, Queen or King. There are 13 potential ranks of cards in the deck. You have less than a 1 and 3 chance of it paying. The best time to make an insurance bet is when the count is (whatever you found it to be.) If the dealer turns out to have a blackjack, you will have a "push" (tie) with the dealer; your insurance bet will pay 2-1 which pays better than the original bet of 3-2! When doubling down, you only get one card. You may not like the hand you end up with. In fact, that is what the casino is counting on! Never double down if the dealer is an ace or a face card (unless you have 11). Splitting can turn an excellent hand into a terrible one, and vice versa. Here are some rules of thumb: Never split 5's -- your total is 10; you are likely to end strong. Always split 8's and Aces. Splitting 8's will change probable losers to probable winners. Splitting Aces is advantageous, but understand this: You are only allowed to split Aces once (sometimes), and you can only take one card for each new hand (sometimes.) Some casinos did this because splitting Aces, without any restriction, is a great advantage. Once you have "surrendered" your hand, the dealer's actions are unimportant (to you). If the dealer's hand goes sour, you have already given up.  You're not literally counting the value of all the cards. What some players do (when they're really good) is count the "value" of the deck, or, more specifically, how many aces and tens are left to be played (or this and that.) If lots are still to be seen, they up their bets, knowing the likelihood of them getting a good hand is better.          Casinos have caught onto this however, and most now use multiple decks in the shoe or cut the deck or both. With six decks in play and more cards taken out, it's not likely with low penetration to track the number of good cards in the deck.  Because of this, card counting will not be outlined here. Refer to wikiHow's card counting page if you're interested in the details.	Understand the "House rules.", Recognize the implications of insurance, splitting, doubling down and surrender. Understand card counting.
Choosing the right clothes depends on where the clothes will be donated. If you live in a hot climate and are donating to a charity that will keep the clothes in the area, a snowsuit might not be the most useful donation.   Similarly, if you are donating to a charity that will sell the clothes for profit, donating items with holes and tears doesn’t help their cause.  Most charities are excited to get whatever donations they can, but make sure you are donating items that are safe and in decent condition.   Clothes don’t have to be brand new, but if they can barely be worn or if they cause a safety risk with lose items or unsafe construction, don’t donate them to charity.  Many charities have limited resources, so it is helpful to clean and organize the clothes before you donate them. Other charities only accept items that are washed and in good condition.   Simply wash the baby clothes in a load of laundry with baby-safe detergent, such as Dreft or All Baby. Because you don’t know if the baby who will receive the clothes is sensitive to chemicals and dyes it is wise to use baby-safe cleaning supplies.  Choose a good container to hold your donations, such as a cardboard box or large garbage bag. You most likely won’t be getting this container back, so choose wisely.   Organize the clothes by size, gender, and season and fold them nicely into the containers.  If you are donating a large amount of items, take an inventory of the items and their approximate worth so you can write-off the donation on your taxes4. Be sure that your chosen charity has the correct tax classification (this shouldn’t be an issue with reputable charities) and keep a file with the value of your donation, the charity, and the donation date.   All of your donations can be lumped together for tax purposes at the end of the year. The approximate value of the donation can be the original cost of items if they are relatively new, or a slightly lesser amount if the items are worn.  Most charities accept donations at their warehouse or office, but only during certain hours. Other charities have drop-boxes or clothing drives around town on specific days. Call or look online to find the details for your chosen charity and follow those instructions for your donation.   If you plan on writing off the donation on your taxes, be sure to get a receipt for the donation.	Consider how useful your donations will be when picking out which clothes to donate. Pick out clothes that are in relatively good condition. Clean the clothes you plan to donate. Fold up the clothes when they are clean and dry. Consider writing off the donation. Deliver the clothes.
This is the meditation step. The "layer-by-layer" followers already sample this in their stages but a more wholesome pause is needed to recollect and remember the wonderful experience.

Reading a variety of riddles will help you understand how a riddle works. There are many books of riddles available, or you can find some online.   Many cultures have riddle traditions. Viking and Anglo-Saxon riddles are still very popular with English speakers, even though they were first told more than a thousand years ago! These riddles often have simple solutions such as “key” or “onion,” but are told in a creative way. You can find many collections online.Riddles are also quite popular in modern fantasy literature, movies, and TV. J.R.R. Tolkien’s book The Hobbit has a whole chapter devoted to “Riddles in the Dark” told between two characters.; , Riddles can be about anything you can imagine, but physical objects that people are familiar with are very, very common topics.   Other topics are natural phenomena like a storm or snow, an animal, or an action. Avoid topics that are very abstract or require specialized knowledge.  Some riddles are very short, just a phrase or two, while others are more like a miniature story. You can make your riddle to be any length you want, but it shouldn’t be so long that your audience can’t follow it.   Here is an example of a very short riddle from the Anglo-Saxon ‘’Book of Exeter’’, written in the 900s AD: “A wonder on the wave / water became bone.” (Answer: ice on a lake.) Here is an example of a longer riddle from the Book of Exeter: “When I am alive I do not speak. / Anyone who wants to takes me captive and cuts off my head. / They bite my bare body / I do no harm to anyone unless they cut me first. / Then I soon make them cry.” (Answer: an onion.)  , Once you have the solution of of your riddle, you will work backward to creating the riddle. Try to choose something easy to personify, as personification (the ascription of human-like qualities to non-human things) is a very common technique in riddle-making.   For example, you could choose "a pencil" as your solution, because most people will be familiar with it.  Compile these ideas in a list. Try to think of verbs and adjectives, in particular. Think of synonyms with multiple meanings and write them down.   For "pencil," some items for your list could include: "No. 2" (the most common type of writing pencil)), "wood," "rubber," "yellow," "pink hat" (the eraser), "looks like the letter 'l' or the number '1'" (physical aspects of the pencil's shape). You could also include other aspects of your pencil: for example, it needs to be sharpened as it writes which means it will get shorter over time the more it's used (a possible paradox). Another common trick is to think of things your item can do: for example, a pencil is small but contains all things (because you can write "all things" with a pencil).  Riddles use metaphors to describe familiar things in unfamiliar ways. Think about the list of ideas you created in the last step. If your solution is “pencil,” think of words you could use to create a metaphorical description: “hand-stick” or “yellow sword” are fanciful, but still offer clues to the solution.   Here is a riddle that uses metaphor to describe a pencil: "A golden sword that wears a rosy hat, it is two trees, both Number 1 and Number 2." The pencil is a "sword" because it is pointed sharply at one end. This description also plays with the common saying, "The pen is mightier than the sword," and may help provide a clue. The "rosy hat" refers to the eraser. The "two trees" are cedar (the most common type of wood used for pencils),and rubber (the type of tree that produces rubber for erasers). The pencil looks like the numeral "1" but is actually a "#2" pencil. This description is a double pun, because the #2 pencil is actually the most common, or "number one," type of pencil.  Riddles were originally a form of oral literature, rather than written down, so think of how the riddle sounds when you say it. Try not to bog down your riddle with elaborate words or abstract concepts.   For example, a simply worded riddle involving a pencil could be: "This thing is small but contains all things; the longer it goes, the shorter it gets." Here is an example of a famous riddle from The Hobbit that uses simple, descriptive language: “A box without hinges, key, or lid, / Yet golden treasure inside is hid.” (Answer: an egg.)  , Another way to make a catchy riddle is to write it as though your solution (the answer to the riddle) is speaking about itself. Start the riddle with “I” and a verb.   For example, this riddle about a pencil uses personification as well as metaphor: "I wear a rosy hat but have no head; I'm sharp but have no brain. I can say anything, but will never speak a word."  , Because riddles are often shared orally, paying attention to how the language sounds will help you make a better riddle. Techniques such as alliteration (using the same letter sounds throughout the riddle) and rhyme help make it easier to tell and listen to your riddle.   For example, "I wear a rosy hat but have no head" uses "h" to create a pleasing alliteration. Here is a very poetic riddle whose solution is a common tool: “I drink the blood of the Earth, / and the trees fear my roar, / yet a man may hold me in his hands.” (Answer: a chainsaw.)Sometimes riddles also use “kennings,” which are poetic, figurative descriptions of something simple -- a riddle within a riddle! In the above riddle, the “blood of the Earth” is gas, which a chainsaw uses for power.This was a very common technique in Viking riddles.  The best way to know if the riddle you’ve made works is to share it with your friends and family and ask them to guess the answer. Sharing your riddles with family and friends may even convince them to make up riddles of their own!  , If your friends and family guess the answer immediately, you may want to go back and make the riddle a little more metaphorical. If they have too much trouble guessing the answer, you may need to tweak the wording to make the answer more evident.	Read a lot of riddles. Decide the subject of your riddle. Determine how long you want your riddle to be. Begin with the answer. Think of the things your answer does and what they look like. Draft your riddle. Use simple, strong words. Personify your solution. Think about how your riddle sounds. Share your riddle with friends. Revise your riddle, if necessary.
To cut costs and be environmentally friendly, you should try to reuse your towels when possible. If you are running a hotel, you may encourage guests to reuse their towels to cut back on cleaning costs and water usage. Have a small sign in the hotel room that notes you are trying to encourage guests to be eco-friendly by asking them to reuse their towels for at least two nights.If you are a homeowner, you may try reusing your towels for a week and hanging them to dry so they are still clean enough to use throughout the week. You may then encourage others in your household to use the same towels for a week to cut down on costs and be more eco-friendly.  Rather than throw away old linens, repurpose them as rags that you can use in the kitchen. Or stitch the old linens together to make kitchen aprons. You can also use old linens as scraps for a quilt or a blanket.You can also re-dye old linens and use them in your decor at home or in your hotel.  Make an effort to cut down on the amount of paper you throw away at home or at your hotel. Wait to fill up toilet paper or tissue boxes until they are almost done. Provide a limited amount of paper items in each guest room so guests are less likely to use them up or throw them away.You can also reduce the amount of newspapers you throw away by offering them at the front desk rather than in each guest’s room. You can also encourage guests to look at the news online. Always use reusable drinking cups that are made of glass instead of paper. Avoid providing items that are one use only, such as plastic shower cups or liners for an ice bucket.  Get in the habit of using containers that can be reused and refilled at home or in your hotel. Stock refillable soap dispensers in the bathroom and the kitchen. Keep refillable shampoo and conditioner bottles in the bathroom. This will cut down on the amount of waste in your home or your hotel and ensure you do not need to keep buying new single use only items for guests.You should also try to get into the habit of reusing containers once they are empty. Reuse containers by washing them out and repurpose them for something else, such as a garbage can, a recycling bin, or a container for other items.  To be more environmentally friendly and cut down on waste, recycle as much as you can. You may put recycling bins in a central area of your home and write a note about what can be recycled and what cannot be recycled. Encourage members of your household to recycle paper, plastic, and glass products.You can also try to recycle any cardboard boxes that are no longer being used in your home as well as the packaging that items come in. Explain what can be recycled to the members of your household and make it a house rule that everyone must recycle. You can also encourage guests at your hotel to recycle by setting up recycling bins by the garbages in common areas of the hotel. You may also put up a sign in the rooms noting what can be recycled in the room and where the guests can put the items to be recycled.	Reuse towels. Reuse old linens. Eliminate paper waste. Use refillable containers. Recycle any products you can no longer use.
Unlike the above methods, this method involves cooling rather than heating dried wax to make it easier to chip or scrape off of a surface. This method is a great choice if the wax is on a hard surface, such as a table or counter top, especially if the wax is too soft and gel-like to easily remove, but not liquid enough to wipe away or soak up. This also works well on non-washable fabrics like rayon and silk.   Canned air is available at most office supply stores. It's also commonly kept in any place where computers are used, like office buildings and schools, as it's often used to clean computers.  Spray the wax with compressed air. The cool, rapidly-moving air should gradually cause the wax to cool and stiffen, becoming more brittle.  Once the wax has hardened, use the edge of a credit card (or another similar stiff plastic item) to scrape it off. The wax should easily separate from the surface it's attached to, chipping off in brittle chunks. Repeat the blowing and scraping processes as needed.   It can be tempting to do so, but don't use a metal object (like a knife) to scrape. Metal can gouge or scratch the surface you're trying to remove the wax from, permanently marring its surface.  When you've scraped as much wax away as you possibly can, you may notice a thin film or residue remaining. Use a little all-purpose cleaner and a wet rag to quickly soak this up and leave your surface like new.  Using ice to freeze some stubborn wax can create minor puddles, but it's quicker and even more effective than canned air. Grab an ice cube with a rag and rub the wax, touching the ice directly to it. The colder wax gets, the more brittle it becomes, so you should have even greater success when scraping it away.	Get a canister of compressed air. Blow the air on the wax to cool it. Scrape away the wax. Follow up with all-purpose cleaner. If you're having trouble, use ice.
Retaining a full knowledge of the products or services you represent will help you answer customer questions correctly. Educate yourself continuously about new product details and functions. Use the products and services you represent. This will help you to relate to the customer and use personal experience to troubleshoot questions. Keep a catalog or spec sheet about products, warranties and contracts close at hand when you answer customer service calls. This will give you a quick reference for answering questions.; ,   A customer with questions will likely have an explanation of the situation that caused the question to arise. Let the customer explain the question fully without interrupting so you understand what the customer is asking.    Jot down key words or notes while the customer is asking a question. Include key details that are being questioned and any pertinent information the customer offers that will be pertinent in answering the customer's question. This allows you to retain information without interrupting.    Summarize and restate the customer's question back to him or her to be sure you understand what is being asked or what needs to be resolved. This technique lets the customer know you're listening and helps you verify the information.    Avoid telling the customer with a question that something can't be done or would never happen. This negative language is dismissive and could make the customer feel that you don't care about answering the question and helping him or her.    Ask for help from a coworker or supervisor if there is any doubt about how to answer a customer's question. Customers will appreciate getting a correct answer, even if it takes a little longer.    Only give a customer an exact price or date of delivery if you can guarantee it. Making false statements about the length of a warranty or when something will be delivered will result in a dissatisfied customer.    Avoid getting defensive or confrontational if a customer is questioning a product or service. He or she could be questioning a customer service procedure or policy, because the customer feels it's unfair or was processed incorrectly. Do your best to answer the customer's question efficiently without letting any negative comments affect the customer service you provide.	Know your products. Allow the customer to explain the question or issue. Take notes. Repeat the question to the customer. Keep language positive. Verify your answers. Promise only what you can deliver. Remain neutral.
Use an ice cube to harden the chewing gum. Hold it until it feels hard enough to start removing without strands of gum floating around. You may need to hold the ice cube with a paper towel to avoid freezing your fingers.; , Naturally, do this carefully to avoid cutting the leather. Butter knives work well because they are not sharp. , Let it sink in for a minute.  Pull the tape back and lift up the chewing gum. Repeat this with a new piece of tape as many times as necessary to pick up the last pieces of the chewing gum. , The jacket should be in top shape again.	Ice the gum. Use a pair of scissors or a blade to remove as much chewing gum as possible from the jacket. Brush off the work so far with a paper towel to remove any loose particles.  , Use a cotton bud to dab a little dry cleaning fluid. Take a piece of adhesive tape and stick it across the remains of the gum. Treat the leather with an appropriate leather conditioning solution.  , Let it air out. Finished.
Some abrasive cleaners are Comet, Barkeeper’s friend, or simple baking soda.These are all powdered cleaners that can be sprinkled on a surface area.  It is easiest to wet the glass first, then apply the powder to it. This way, the powder will stick to the surface of the glass. The water and the abrasive will work together to make a sort of cleaning paste.  Many purpose-made powder cleaners have multiple holes in the top that facilitate sprinkling. If yours doesn’t, or if you’re using baking soda, you could try putting the powder in a small sifter and sprinkling it on the surface with that.  Think of it as a double benefit: cleaning and a workout at one time!         , While some cleaning products can be left on the glass, an abrasive cleaner is likely to leave a residue since it isn’t designed specifically as a glass cleaner. Thoroughly rinsing the cleaner away with water, then cleaning the glass with a traditional glass cleaner is the best way to ensure that the abrasive cleaner does not leave any residue.  After you rinse away the cleaner and clean the glass with water or glass cleaner, be sure that you dry the surface thoroughly to prevent additional water spots.  An alternate approach to using an abrasive cleaner is to use an abrasive scrubber. The scrubber essentially works like very fine sandpaper to remove stains and build-up from the glass. Some popular abrasive scrubbers are steel wool,rough green scrub sponges, and a product known as a magic eraser, which is a very fine sponge.	Find a powdered abrasive cleaner. Wet the surface of the glass. Apply the powdered cleaner to the glass. Use some “elbow grease.” The major benefit of the abrasive cleaners is the micro-scrubbing action provided by the granules of the cleaner.In order for these granules to work, you will need to apply some vigorous scrubbing. Rinse the product away with water. Dry the glass. Use an abrasive scrubber.
At your local arts and crafts store, you’ll see a choice between powder, spray on, and liquid glue. Unless you are comfortable mixing your own glue, it is best to choose the liquid variety.Pick a size that is suitable for the size of your jigsaw puzzle.You can also find jigsaw puzzle glue online. If you want to make your own glue, just mix one-part water with one-part white glue. Shake the mixture and you have puzzle glue!If you pick the 8 ounce (236 milliliter) bottle, you should be able to glue between 8 and 12 puzzles, depending on the size.; , Cut a piece of parchment paper one inch (2.54 centimeters) larger than the size of your finished puzzle. By using parchment paper, you can avoid gluing your puzzle to the work table.Although you may be tempted to use newspaper for this purpose, it is strongly discouraged. It will likely get stuck to your puzzle in the gluing process.  Since you don’t want to disturb your finished puzzle, it is best to carefully slide the parchment paper underneath the puzzle. Align the shape of the parchment paper with the shape of the finished puzzle. Place one edge of the parchment paper underneath one edge of the puzzle and gently slide it undernearth the puzzle.You could ask a friend to hold the puzzle while you pull the parchment paper underneath.  Since you’ll need the puzzle to be completely flat before applying any glue, you should make sure there are no edges sticking up or missing pieces. Use a rolling pin to press down any raised edges and to ensure the puzzle is completely flat., You can pour some glue directly onto the picture side of the puzzle. Alternately, you can use a brush to apply some glue to the puzzle. You should start with a small circle of glue, and then add more as needed.Avoid adding too much glue at once, since it can lead to swelling., Use your paint brush to spread the glue evenly across the picture side of the puzzle. If you don’t have a paintbrush, you can use a business card or a piece of cardboard to spread the glue. Make sure you cover all of the pieces of the puzzle!At this stage, you may see some air bubbles. This is fine, since they will go away when the glue dries.  Look on the bottle of glue to find out the drying time for your puzzle glue. Typically, it is around 5 hours. Let the puzzle dry completely., Use your paintbrush to apply a second layer of glue. Let it dry completely., Slide the puzzle onto a piece of cardboard. Use the cardboard to flip the puzzle over onto the work table with the back of the puzzle facing up. Spread a thin layer of glue over the back of the puzzle. Let it dry completely. At this point, your puzzle should be sturdy and ready for display!	Get liquid jigsaw puzzle glue. Use parchment paper to avoid gluing the puzzle to the table. Slide the parchment paper under the finished puzzle. Flatten the puzzle with a rolling pin. Apply glue to the picture side of the puzzle. Spread the glue evenly across the surface of the finished puzzle. Let the glue bond and dry for 5 hours. Apply a second coat of glue. Apply glue to the back of the puzzle and let it dry.

; , For example, descriptions of autographed manuscripts and documents need to include type of autograph e.g. typed letter signed, handwritten letter signed, size, date, and condition. Descriptions of books containing autographs need to include information about the book e.g is it a first edition? and condition of accompanying dust jacket. Potential buyers also need to know details of any inscription that accompanies an autograph on a book or photograph. , This number is the least amount of payment you are willing to accept on the sale of your item. Setting the bottom limit protects you from having your item sold at an unreasonably low price or at a significant loss.  Check autograph collecting publications, such as "Autograph Collector", that list advertisers from autograph auction companies, and websites like Roger Epperson's Autograph Alert Truth for reviews of autograph auction houses.  For example, some auction houses specialize in autographs from famous sports personalities, others may specialize in notable personalities who have autographed stocks and bonds.  Public records show that "Remember When Auctions" and "RRAuctions" have been involved in lawsuits related to autograph fraud. The Universal Autograph Collectors Club has issued warnings on at least one autograph auction company from New Hampshire.  Autograph auction houses usually supply their terms on request. Often, this information is downloadable from their website.  Unless you are a professional autograph dealer, the auction company should take responsibility for proper evaluation of your autographs, and also provide guarantees of authenticity to their customers.

You will notice the following things:   A triangle on the left hand side. This only appears in our photo above, or in your viewfinder, if you have not armed the shutter.  A needle on the right hand side. This is a meter reading. Take note of the +, O and - markings on the scale; we'll be referring to them later.  Three circles in the centre of the image, which are your focusing aids.  Turn the focus ring of your lens until you have a sharp picture. You have three focusing aids that will help you.  The split-image in the centre. This will cause straight vertical lines to appear split in half if they are out of focus, and they will rejoin when they are in focus. Sometimes half of this image will be blacked out, for example with slow lenses (f/4 and slower). The microprism ring outside of that will shimmer when the subject in that area is out of focus, and will be clear when it is in focus. The ground glass of the circle around that will help you if the above focusing aids are not helpful in your shooting situation.  The MTL3 is a fully manual camera, but this is hardly any harder than doing the same thing on a digital SLR in manual mode.  Press and hold the metering key on the front of the camera. The viewfinder might darken as you do this. This is normal; the MTL3 needs to stop down the lens to measure how much light will come through the lens at the given aperture (this is called "stopped-down metering").    Press and hold the metering key. This is the big black button near the shutter button, which turns on the camera's meter.   Look at the needle. If it is in the middle of the "O" mark, then you have a correct exposure. If not, then adjust either your shutter speed or the aperture ring on your lens until it is correct. A fuller explanation of the role of aperture and shutter speed is beyond the scope of this article, but you might want to take a look at How to understand camera exposure.    The MTL's metering needle in action. Left-to-right: indicating under-exposure (towards the - mark), indicating over-exposure (needle towards the + mark), and indicating a roughly correct exposure (needle close to the O mark).  Press the shutter button all the way down; you'll get a nice, reassuring click from the shutter.	Look through the viewfinder. Focus. Set the exposure. Shoot!, Wind on your film to the next frame and keep shooting until you hit the end of your roll of film.
The design in this part creates a “dragster”-style car that is very light and has a low, stable center of gravity. You can design your own car, but try to keep it lightweight and low to the ground.   For this design, you will need 2 rectangular axles, 4 tires of equal size, 4 2x8 bricks, 8 2x4 bricks, 2 1x2 bricks, and a thin plate at least 2x4 (but a longer plate is better). You will also need one small party balloon., Each row should be 2x16 now. Snap a 2x4 brick to the top of each row to connect the 2x8 bricks.  Snap the thin plate to the bottom of both rows so that they are connected.   Attach the tires to the axles. Place an axle at each end of the car. Turn the body over. You should now have a car body that is 4x16 with the two 2x4 bricks on top and wheels on the bottom.  Snap this column to the back of your car body. Make sure the bricks are connected snugly, but don’t press too hard or you might break the car body.   Snap the 1x2 bricks to the top of the 2x4 column. Place one at each end to create a little hollow in the middle. Attach the final 2x4 brick to the top of the column. You should have a small hole in the middle of the column near the top.  In order to propel your car, you will want the body of the balloon to be placed over the body of your car. Slip the neck of the balloon through the hole, but don’t pull the balloon all the way through.  You may find it easier to blow up the balloon if you pick up the car and hold it close to your face while you inflate it. When the balloon is inflated, pinch the neck with your fingers to keep the air in.  Release the neck of the balloon. Your car should speed away from you as the air pushes out of the balloon!	Build a basic LEGO car. Place the 2x8 bricks together end-to-end in two rows. Turn the connected bricks over. Stack 5 2x4 bricks together. Thread the balloon through the hole. Inflate the balloon. Place your car on a flat, smooth surface.

Because of the quick evaporation time, rubbing alcohol will not leave a mark on fabrics like polyester and microfiber like water does. It will have a scent while you are cleaning, but will leave no scent after the task has been completed.  Use a sponge to scrub these areas, lifting dirt from the upholstery. Don’t spray large sections at a time, as you don’t won’t have time to scrub it all before the alcohol evaporates.  Move the brush in small circular motions to return the fabric back to its previous state.  Your clean couch is now ready to be sat in again!	Fill a spray-bottle with rubbing alcohol. Mist your couch in small sections with the rubbing alcohol. Take a soft brush and rub down the whole couch. Replace all pillows and cushions.
Different versions of the Wheel of Fortune games have different minimum jackpots. Some gamblers believe that smaller jackpots are easier to win.Even if this isn’t the case, machines with smaller jackpots have smaller maximum bets, which will allow you to stretch your money further. Note that the $25 and $100 Wheels have fixed jackpots that are not progressive.   For example, lower maximum bet games often have a minimum jackpot of $200,000, while the higher maximum bet games usually have a minimum jackpot of $1,000,000.  Over two dozen kinds of Wheel of Fortune slot machines exist.These games will have different winning combinations and symbols, but they’ll all include a bonus "spin" option that lets you spin the Wheel of Fortune. Almost all of the versions have the same odds, so choose one that looks fun to you.   You can identify these games by the large spinning wheel over the main part of the machine. All of these machines use random number generators to determine outcomes.  Many professional gamblers avoid slot machines because the chance of winning your money back is low.Furthermore, no matter how high the jackpot gets, slot machines aren’t required to pay out. A larger jackpot doesn’t give you a better chance of winning.   Because the machines use random number generators to decide outcomes, your odds won’t ever change no matter what time of day you play.    Slot machines are built to take daily use. They are armor-plated, have tempered glass, and are equipped with sensors that detect tampering and abuse. They are tested against various types of behavior before leaving the factory, including zapping it with a Tazer. You cannot affect the outcome by slamming it, banging it, hudging it, lifting it off its foundation, or other forms of physicality. What will happen is much like the pinball machines of old: the machine will detect the abuse and shut itself down, which also voids any credits you have left. You will then find yourself surrounded by security or police, who may arrest you but will more likely escort you off the premises. Remember, cameras are everywhere, so whatever bad behavior you exhibit is recorded and can be used against you in court. Those of us who play regularly have had our bad days and our good days; if you arent having a good day, there is always tomorrow. Walk away, go have a meal, or a massage, or a swim, or go shopping.
