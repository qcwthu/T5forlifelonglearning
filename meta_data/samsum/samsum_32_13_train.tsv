summarize: Laura: Hello everyone! What are we doing on Saturday? Brain storm, please! Isabel: I think each kid should be siting alone. We need to make it difficult for them to run around the classroom and talk to each other. Everyone will hopefully focus on making decorations then. Henry: I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt there last time, but I don‚Äôt think we should create a ‚Äòschool atmosphere‚Äô, if you know what I mean. Isabel: We need to maintain discipline. It was a real challenge last time. Henry: Ok, I understand. Laura: We tried to treat them as partners, but it didn‚Äôt work out. We probably need to take a new approach. I promise to be harsh. I hate to say that, but I strongly encourage you to be harsh as well. They really need to learn that they have to respect us and our time. Henry: You‚Äôre probably right. Now I think Isabel‚Äôs idea sounds fine. Laura: Trust me. I wish I knew what to do. But I‚Äôm lost. I need your advice. What do you think Jessie? Jessie: I was thinking of making a big table.

Jessie: Each kid should have someone to help as well. Laura: Ok, I got it. Thank you for expressing your opinions. We will make a big round circle with a hole inside.

His stuff seemed to be SO unrelated to the subject‚Ä¶ Raul: Live tweeting made me focus on what he was saying so I can tell you there were a few bits of info that he gave that were relevant (in my view) Raul: But what happens is that their collection is very specific, so if you‚Äôre not working on the few subjects they specialise in, they‚Äôre basically useless William: Ahhh ok. You‚Äôre right!	William, Ted and Raul really liked the event. There was a lot of relevant info. Raul was live tweeting. Ivy's going to retweet everything.

It should have a black switch on it which you can turn Riley: <file_photo> Is it this one? Is it going to explode when I touch it? Tyler: That looks right to me. If you turn it, it should pour water into the system and the needle on the other dial should start going up. Turn it for ten seconds, and if it looks like nothing is happening then turn it off and assume I'm wrong, sorry I can't be 100% sure Riley: Nothing is happening. Ok, we are happy enough without the heating. Heating is for weak people. Tyler: Sorry I can't think of another solution, may be one for Nedd to look at. I can give you his number but not sure if he'll be around since it's boxing day Riley: Ok, we know. No worries. We will wait until tomorrow. It turned off itself, maybe it can turn on itself too.
