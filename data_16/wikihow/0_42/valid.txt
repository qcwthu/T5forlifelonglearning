There are now a number of websites devoted to online fundraising. You will want to choose one which is reputable and associated with the kind of project you’d like to do. For example, Kickstarter and Indiegogo are the two most popular platforms for arts projects and creating physical products for sale, where GoFundMe, Fundly, and Crowdrise are for charities and individuals raising money., You will need to have a solid plan for the money you get, carefully laying out exactly how you’ll use it and when you’ll meet deadlines. Share these plans with your backers so that they know you’ve planned ahead.  In order to encourage people to donate, it is important to have great rewards or incentives, if the platform you are using allows this. Make sure these rewards are something you can provide and that they will not set you back financially. Get as many donated rewards as you can.  You will want to frequently let people know what’s going on as your donation period progresses. This will keep people interested and engaged, as well as encourage them to share the project with their friends.  Interact with donors as well as potential donors. This will draw more people into your project, as well as keeping current donors engaged and interested in what you are doing. Message back everyone who sends you questions or feedback, post videos talking about your plans, and go out on to forums which relate to your project to find more interested parties.  See if local papers or new programs are interested in reporting on your project. Find online blogs that may be interested in what you are doing. Post on forums and take advantage of social media to make sure as many people as possible know about what you are doing and why they’d love to help you out.  Be extremely gracious with everyone who donates. Let people know how much you appreciate their money. This will make them want to support you more in the future, or maybe even donate more money than they did at first.	Pick a website to use. Have a solid plan and share that with your backers. Have great rewards. Update often. Interact with people. Advertise. Be thankful.
For books without covers or to protect your textbooks, make a paper cover for your book. You can cover your books with foreign or old newspapers, old or new maps, sheet music, old wall paper, a brown paper bag, etc.. Unless you are covering a smaller book, you will need a large piece of paper to make your cover. It will need to be at least double the length of your book and three inches taller than the height of your book. , To find the width of the book, lay the book open and measure the width with a measuring tape or ruler. Then add 6 inches, 3 inches to cover both sides of the book. Next measure the height of the book and add 3 inches, 1 ½ inches to cover the top and bottom of the book.   Using a ruler, mark a faint line with a pencil on your paper the dimensions of your cover, and then with a sharp pair of scissors, cut your paper to size. Avoid laying the book out so that a previous crease that was in a bag or on your paper aligns with a cover edge. If your paper is already worn, it will tear more easily when it is on an edge of the book., Close your book and center it on the paper. Faintly mark the edges of the top and bottom of the book then add an extra ¼ inch so that the book will fit inside of the cover. Take the book off the paper, and fold the paper up to the spot marked and make your fold into a crease. Repeat the process with the top of the book; fold the paper down and create your crease about a 1/4 inch above the top of the book.   Go back over the creases you have made in the paper with a pen or bone folder. You want your creases to be crisp and clean, especially if you are using heavy paper. , Use double-sided tape to tape down the folds you have just made so that they do not flap. The double sided tape will help the cover stays snug on the book once it is covered. Place the tape toward the center of your cover, leaving about three inches at both sides for your book to fit in the cover.  Lay your book open flat on the paper and center the book so that both sides have the same amount of paper for the flaps. Press your book down so it does not move, and fold the paper over the right side of the book and create a crease. Go back over the crease, more lightly than before, with the side of your pen or your bone folder. To accommodate for the thickness of the cover, do not make the creases too heavy.   With the flap in the right side of the book, close the book and wrap the paper around the book and mark where you want to fold the paper to make the last flap. Take the book of the paper, and crease the flap for the left side of the book. Go over the crease with your bone folder or pen again, but remember to keep the crease lighter.  Gently place the back of the book into the fold on the back of your paper cover. Then wrap the paper cover around the book and tuck the top cover of the book carefully into the front of the paper cover.	Choose paper to cover your book with. Cut the paper to size using the measurements for your book. Fold the paper 1/4 inch above the top and bottom of the book. Tape down the top and bottom folds. Create the folds for the sides of the book. Fit your book inside of the cover.
This air freshener closely resembles those fragrant room sprays you might get in a store, except that it does not contain any harmful ingredients. Here's what you will need to make this freshener:8 ounce (240 milliliter) glass spray bottle 2 tablespoons vodka, rubbing alcohol, or witch hazel ¾ cup (180 milliliters) distilled water 15 to 20 drops essential oil blend  , If you cannot find a glass bottle, then use a high quality plastic one. Try to use glass however, as essential oils can eat through most types of plastic.  You can use all one small, or experiment with different combinations. Here are a few ideas to get you started:To make a calming scent, use the following essential oils: 10 drops lavender and 5 to 8 drops chamomile. To make an energizing scent, use the following essential oils: 5 drops wild orange, 5 drops lemon, 5 drops lime, and 5 drops grapefruit. To made a fresh-smelling spray, use the following essential oils: 5 drops lavender, 5 drops lemon, and 5 drops rosemary. To make a refreshing scent, use the following essential oils: 4 drops tea tree oil, 8 drops lemon, and 6 drops eucalyptus.  The vodka, rubbing alcohol, or witch hazel will help dissolve the oil and make it easier to blend with the water. They will also help preserve your spray.  You might end up using a little bit less water, depending on the shape of your bottle and how much essential oil you used.  Whenever you want to freshen up your room, shake the bottle and give the room three to four squirts. The oils will naturally separate over time, so you will need to shake the bottle each time before you use it.	Gather your supplies. Pour 2 tablespoons of vodka, rubbing alcohol, or witch hazel into an 8 ounce (240 milliliter) spray bottle. Add 15 to 20 drops of essential oil. Close the spray bottle and shake it. Add ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of water to the bottle and shake it again. Use your spray.
Most attorneys have websites through which you can learn about their background and experience. In some cases, online consultations are offered directly through the attorney's website.Some attorneys' websites feature a pop-up window that will ask if you have any questions and encourage you to chat online. However, keep in mind that when you use these windows to ask questions, you probably are not speaking directly to the attorney who owns the website. Other attorneys mention the possibility of online consultation in their bios or firm descriptions. Even if direct consultation services aren't mentioned, most attorneys include their email addresses on their websites. If you find an attorney who you think might be able to answer your questions, you can copy his or her email address, send an email, and go from there.  Particularly if you need a local attorney to offer specific advice rather than a quick general consultation, you should select the attorney using much of the same criteria you'd use to evaluate an attorney you wanted to hire to represent you completely.Attorneys typically provide significant information about their background and experience on their websites, or on directory listings. You also may want to search for reviews from clients so you can better understand each attorney's reputation and what it's like to work with him or her.  If you've found an attorney you like but online consultations aren't mentioned on the attorney's website, you typically can send an email and ask whether online consultations are possible.Maintain a professional tone in your email, and take care not to make it too long or rambling. Provide a brief description of your legal issue or situation, and explain that you would like to consult with the attorney online. Attorneys often will want to encourage you to come to their offices, so if there is some reason that you prefer online communication or cannot travel to an attorney's office without difficulty, include that information. Let the attorney know how you would prefer to conduct an online consultation. If you don't mind sending an email and waiting for a response, that's one option. However, if you want real-time discussion using text or video chat, mention it specifically. You also want to make it clear what scope of representation or assistance you want. Not every attorney is willing to simply answer questions without representing someone in court – and some lawyers are reluctant to assist in drafting a legal document unless you hire them to prepare the document in its entirety.  If the attorney is open to an online consultation, work with him or her to set an appointment for a real-time conversation using either text or video chat. This gives the attorney an opportunity to accurately assess your issue and give you advice that is complete and accurate.Keep in mind that attorneys are busy people and their time is valuable. If an attorney is willing to do an online consultation in real-time, ask him or her how long you can have – and don't go over that time limit. If the attorney gives you a list of documents or information he or she needs, be sure to provide them as soon as possible in advance of your scheduled consultation.  To answer your question, the attorney likely will need to understand a little about the issue and the reason you need help. It might make things easier if you create a brief synopsis or timeline describing the issue at hand.Even if the attorney hasn't asked you for specific information, think of what you would need to know to answer the question. Write down as many facts and details as you can about your situation. Keep in mind that something you don't think is important might have crucial relevance to the law that governs your particular situation. If your questions are related to specific documents you or someone else has prepared, such as a contract or a will, have the document ready to share with the attorney if he or she asks for it.	Visit attorneys' websites. Investigate attorneys' background and experience. Find out if the attorney does online consultations. Schedule your online consultation. Gather information about your situation.
Even if you were using a vacuum, large chunks of dirt or trash need to be picked up. Get a small trash bag and take the time to bend down and clean up before getting started with any deeper cleaning. This will make your home look cleaner already.; , If you have any area rugs or smaller, removable carpets, take them outside. Over your lawn or driveway, vigorously shake out the dirt and debris. Be careful not to breathe in deeply since dust will be flying around. Take note if there’s any wind that may blow dirt back toward your house., Roll out and cut a few inches of tape and press it to the carpet to pick up loose hair, fur, or dirt.Discard of the tape strip when its stickiness is gone and cut off a new piece. This method is time consuming since tape strips are thin, but is an easy way to clean surfaces without doing a deep clean.   Lint rollers are an alternative to using packaging tape. Break the carpet into sections to make cleaning less daunting and so you can keep track of where you’ve already cleaned. Don’t wear dirty clothes or shoes to clean since you’ll be on the ground, but also keep in mind that you may end up dirty after cleaning.  You can buy carpet brushes or sweepers at home good stores. Take the brush across the carpet like you would with a hairbrush. This method is good for carpets that have longer fibers; you can reach deeply into the grain of the carpet and pull out dirt that’s trapped.Pick a brush that has stiffer bristles for short fiber carpets. Soft synthetic bristles won’t have enough tension or power to push dirt off. A brush with metal teeth is good for faux fur rugs or very fine carpets. Be careful though as it may damage and separate a delicate weave. Some brushes come on the end of long broom-like handles so you don’t have to clean on your knees.	Pick up large pieces of debris by hand. Shake area rugs outside. Use packaging tape to pick up hair and pet fur. Brush the carpet clean.
; , (If possible do it silently).  This is the key.  The human mind instinctively looks left, right, and back -- but not up or down. Make sure you're not at eye-level.  This will make whoever sees you less likely to associate a small shape with a human body in their brain.  The human eye detects motion before anything else, even more so at night. , There's a much higher chance of staying hidden if you don't move. Even if they seem to be looking right at you they may not have seen you, so don't even move your eyes if they are looking in your direction.  (e.g. if you are wearing all black clothes in a bedroom, it may still work to get on a bed with pillows, get behind all the pillows, and then curl up to disguise yourself as a pillow.)  , The person (or people) you're hiding from would not think to look in such a small area.  Use the steps detailed above.  Hide in the basement! Or the garage! You can even hide in the car, but be careful that you don't mess around with the car and accidentally start the engine and make sure you don't lock yourself inside. Open the window just a little bit for air circulation but not enough to be noticable. Hide behind a sofa. If there are some curtains behind a sofa, hide behind them too, for double protection. If people look behind the sofa all they will see is the curtains (which you are hiding behind.) Hide under a large pile of pillows!	Make sure you are not being observed or break line of sight. Step behind your cover or into the shadows. Keep quiet!, If it's possible get up high or crouch. Try to compress your body as much as possible. Stay still (especially at night). If possible, cover yourself with your surroundings (leaves in a forest, clothes in a laundry room).  , When hiding, it's worth noting that people are very quick to detect movement. If you aren't hidden by the time they are looking, dart to the nearest place, even if it's obvious. If you're small enough go and hide in small places. Draw a map of your area the day before you hide and circle some good hiding spots. Here are some ideas of hiding places:   You can hide in your closet behind some old bags of clothes, or even in a big box.
In Hawaii, divorces are all handled by the Family Court, but each island has its own “circuit” of the Family Court. You should contact the court in your area.   Oahu is the First Circuit.The Family Court for the First Circuit is located at Family Court Service Center, Ronald T. Y. Moon Judiciary Courthouse, 4675 Kapolei Parkway, Kapolei, Hawai`i 96707-3272. Its phone number is (808) 954-8290. The islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai make up the Second Circuit.The Family Court for the Second Circuit is located at Wailuku Circuit Court, 2145 Main Street, Room 106, Wailuku, Hawai`i 96793. Its phone number is (808) 244-2969. The island of Hawaii makes up the Third Circuit. The Family Court for the Third Circuit has two locations. The first is Circuit Court, Hilo,Hale Kaulike, 777 Kilauea Avenue, Hilo, Hawai`i 96720-4212, and its phone number is (808) 961-7400. The second court is at Circuit Court, Kona, 79-1020 Haukapila Street, Kealakekua, Hawai`i 96750, and its phone number is (808) 322-8750. The island of Kauai is the Fifth Circuit.The Family Court for the Fifth Circuit is located at Pu’uhonua Kaulike, Judiciary Complex, 3970 Ka’ana Street, Lihue, Hawaii 96766. Its phone number is (808)482-2330. Notice that there is no Fourth Circuit.; , Whether you are filing an uncontested divorce, which is one in which both parties are able to agree on everything, or a contested divorce, which has certain issues that the judge will have to decide, there are basic forms that are common to both. Each circuit, however, has slightly different sets of forms. You may get copies of the forms by going to the court address, by calling the court to ask for the forms to be mailed to you, or by using the court’s web address:   First Circuit Forms: http://www.courts.state.hi.us/self-help/courts/forms/oahu/family_court_forms  Second Circuit Forms: http://www.courts.state.hi.us/self-help/courts/forms/maui/family_court_forms  Third Circuit Forms: http://www.courts.state.hi.us/self-help/courts/forms/hawaii/family_court_forms  Fifth Circuit Forms: http://www.courts.state.hi.us/self-help/courts/forms/kauai/family_court_forms   , Not every form will apply to every family situation. The packet of forms, either online or that you will get from the courthouse, will contain a Forms Checklist. Read this carefully. It will tell you which forms are required, which apply only to special circumstances, the numbers of copies that you will need, and the order of completing them.  The court clerk may be able to assist you in some cases about the meanings of forms, but they will not answer legal questions. For legal questions about completing the paperwork, you will need to consult with a family law attorney., Whether you are filing a contested divorce or an uncontested divorce, the paper that starts the whole proceeding is the divorce complaint. The person initiating the divorce, called the “plaintiff,” completes and files the Complaint for Divorce. This needs to be completed and filed with the court for the correct circuit. It must be filed with the clerk, along with the filing fee. The filing fee is $215, with an additional surcharge of $50 if there are children involved in the divorce., As part of the Complaint, the plaintiff will have to state the reason for the divorce. In Hawaii, it does not matter if the two parties agree on the grounds for the divorce. If one person wants the divorce, it will be granted, but it begins with this statement. The complaint form contains three selections for the grounds for divorce:The marriage is irretrievably broken. The parties have lived separate and apart for 2 or more years under a separation agreement. The parties have lived separate and apart for 2 or more years, and there is no expectation that they will get back together.  The plaintiff must serve (deliver) the complaint and summons to the other spouse, known as the defendant. The plaintiff must complete a Proof of Service form that declares how the complaint and summons were delivered.The complaint contains the plaintiff’s statements about:   the grounds for the divorce the number and ages of the children custody and visitation of children alimony and support payments.  This is where the two parties will determine whether this is going to be an uncontested or a contested divorce. If there is total agreement, the parties will work together to complete the remaining paperwork, and file the forms as a contested divorce. If there are differences, then they will proceed as a contested divorce.  The court will require both parents and any children ages 6-17 to attend an informational program known as “Kids First.” This is a program designed to help parents and children understand the effects of separation and divorce. Facilitators work with the children to help them express their feelings or questions.	Know which court to use. Get the paperwork you need. Use the Forms Checklist. Get assistance with the forms. Begin with the Divorce Complaint. State the grounds for divorce. Serve the complaint and summons. Meet to discuss the terms of the divorce. Attend “Kids First.” Whether the divorce is contested or uncontested, this step is required if there are children in the marriage.
This is the total amount of money it costs to produce a product, equal to the total fixed cost plus the total variable cost. Every element of production must be factored into the total cost, including labor, commissions, utilities, marketing, administrative costs, office supplies, shipping and handling, materials, interest and any other cost that pertains to the specific product. It is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost., The ATC is the total cost, divided by the number of units.Going with our previous example from method 1, if the total cost is $35,000 over the two months when 10,000 units are produced, then the ATC will be $3.50 per unit.  Variable costs change according to the quantity of product produced, increasing as production goes up and decreasing as production goes down. For example, the two most predominant variable costs are manufacturing labor and materials. Variable costs also include utilities that vary with production, like the electricity and gas used in manufacturing, for example.Continuing with the same example, imagine the total variable cost is comprised of $2,000 in materials, $3,000 in utilities ($1,500 per month for two months), and $10,000 ($5,000 per month for two months) in manufacturing wages. Add these numbers up to get a total variable cost of $15,000 for your two month period. For more information, see how to calculate variable costs   , So, for our total variable cost of $15,000 when 10,000 units are produced, the AVC would be $1.50 per unit.  Subtract the average variable cost from the average total cost. The answer will be the average fixed cost. In the example, the average variable cost of $1.50 per unit would be subtracted from the average total cost of $3.50 per unit in order to reach an average fixed cost amount of $2 per unit. Note that this matches the average fixed cost calculated in method 1.	Calculate the total cost. Figure out the average total cost (ATC). Determine the total variable cost amount. Calculate the average variable cost (AVC) by dividing the total variable costs by the number of units produced. Calculate average fixed cost.
potassium hydrogen tartrate. This is a natural acid that comes from grapes and other fruits. It is usually used in cooking, but its acidic properties make it great for cleaning silver. You can find it in most grocery stores in the spice section.; , Immerse one cup in the solution for five minutes. This step serves as an initial cleaning and also helps to loosen up the tarnish for the next step.  Then wipe it dry with a soft towel.  You can just pour about a teaspoon of cream of tartar into a small bowl, wet your toothbrush, and then dip it into the powder. Scrub a bit, and then re-wet and re-dip the brush as necessary.  The difference is striking!	Clean it with cream of tartar, a.k.a. Dissolve one teaspoon of cream of tartar in one cup of water in a small mixing bowl. Remove the cup from the solution. Scrub the silver with a toothbrush using a paste made from cream of tartar and a few drops of water. Scrub it all over until it is clean and polished.
If a triangle has sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 feet (or any other unit), it must be a right triangle with a 90º angle between the short sides. If you can "find" this triangle in your corner, you know the corner is square. This is based on the Pythagorean Theorem from geometry: A2 + B2 = C2 for a right triangle. C is the longest side (hypotenuse) and A and B are the two shorter "legs."3-4-5 is a very convenient measurement to check because of the low, whole numbers. The math checks out: 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.; , You can use feet, meters, or any other unit. Draw a mark at the end of three units.   You can multiply each number by the same amount and still use this. Try 30-40-50 centimeters if using the metric system. For a large room, use 6-8-10 or 9-12-15 feet or meters.  Using the same unit, measure along the second side, at – hopefully – a 90º angle to the first. Mark this point at four units.  If the distance is 5 units, your corner is square.If the distance is less than 5 units, your corner is less than 90º. Move the sides apart. If the distance is over 5 units, your corner has a measurement of more than 90º. Bring the sides closer together. You can use a framing square as a guide when you do this. Once you’ve got a square corner, you can check the room’s other three corners to ensure they’re the same.	Understand the 3-4-5 method. Measure three units from the corner along one side. Measure four units along the other side. Measure the distance between your marks.
A great way to make a secret fort indoors is by hiding it in plain sight. No one will guess the place you sleep is a spy base. Place two to three chairs on one side of your bed, preferably on the opposite side of your bedroom door. Throw blankets or sheets over the chairs and hold the other ends on your bed with heavy books., Find a large box to use as a fort. If you or anyone you know is sent something big, like a T.V. or refrigerator, claim the box it comes in as your own. Find a discreet spot to set up spy camp. Put it behind your bed or other furniture.  If your kitchen has lower cabinets, this can be a great place for an indoor spy fort. Clear several ones out next to each other for an extra spacious hideout. This is also a great opportunity to help your parents reorganize the kitchen.  Very similar to using kitchen cabinets, but this hideout can be cleared out and claimed from any number of closets throughout your house. Find a closet that is not used very often in a room the least amount of people go into. Make this closet your spy fort.	Use your bed. Make one out of a box. Clear out bottom cabinets. Make a closet hideout.

Medicaid is a healthcare program for individuals and families with low incomes which is jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Qualifications vary by state. In many states, those with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line are eligible.In other states, eligibility is much more restricted and reserved for pregnant women, people with disabilities, and some low-income families.To check if you qualify for Medicaid, you should contact your state’s Department of Human Services.  The federal Social Security Administration pays benefits to adults and children suffering from a long-term disability. The law states that the disability must be one that prevents you from working for a year or that will result in death.   For information on how to register, see wikiHow’s How to Get Social Security Disability.  Every state and most counties should have free medical clinics. Most offer medical, dental, and legal services at little to no cost to their patients and/or customers. They also have good local contacts for additional assistance programs.	Sign up for Medicaid. Register for disability benefits. Check your phone book for "Free Clinic."
There are five basic types. All require periodic inspection and can need maintenance to fix any punctures, tears, cracks or cuts. They are all in rolls of 1 yard (91.44 cm), or in 1 meter width (39.4 inches) except for Single-ply Membrane which come folded:   Built-up Roofing: This method, known simply as BUR, is done by overlapping rolls of treated felt using hot (molten) tar or asphalt. It becomes brittle and cracks up over the years. Single-Ply Membrane Roofs: This type is excellent but requires propane torch heat to install the seams. The membrane may be injured, cut, etc. and with only the one layer that can be problematic. Sprayed Polyurethane Foam: This kind of roofing material is sprayed, or squeegeed flowed onto the surface and may be protected by a special second coating. Modified Bitumen (Asphalt) Roll Roofing: This is a method in which a single layer of asphalt-treated, granule coated felt is cold cement sealed or hot sealed to the primed decking or to a base sheet. "SA" Self-adhesive (SBS, APP or modified bitumen) rolls: These often include (1) both an SA base sheet and the SA cap sheet, both come in rolls -- or (2) only a single cap layer is applied to a primed decking. (The material has a split backing where after a length of it is rolled-out and aligned, then half the backing is pealed off and that half smoothed down; next the other half of backing is peeled and smoothed down as well.)  , Different roof types require different materials. The amount of each material depends on the surface area of the roof.  Use a special scraper, square nose spade or shovel, or such to loosen the old roofing material., Check for and repair low areas because they will not drain well. The roof rafters are like joists; there is not much pitch, or incline, and they may warp and sag. Repair any sagging rafters and decking to prevent ponding/standing water. Some roofs have drains, such as having walls around the roof and have drains to be keep cleared and intact.  Can't strips should have 2 45 degree cuts and be fitted into inside corners of the roof surface. The felt used in BUR cannot bend at right angles. The can't strips help ameliorate the problem.  It is made of paper, polyester OR fiberglass saturated with asphalt. It is set down with a 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) seam, or overlap, between sheets.   Fasten the sheets with special (large, thin-headed) roofing nails (in appropriate length for your process and thickness of deck or sheathing), spaced about 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart along the overlapped edges and staggered 12 inches (30.48 cm) apart elsewhere ("in the field"). The edge of roof nailing of roofing (if required) is staggered (to not split deck) close, 2 inch (~ 5 cm) spacing. Cut the base sheet to fit around vents in the roof and lay it over the can't strips.  Flashes are material you apply around vents and other areas to prevent water damage. You can further protect the roof from water damage by applying plastic roofing cement at these sites.  There are several types of felt you can use to replace your roof. Most are either coal-tar or asphalt saturated paper or fiberglass fibers (all may be called fabric or felt). The felt material comes in rolls that are 36 inches (91.44 cm) or 1M (39.4 inches) wide.   Read labels. Consider the type of roof and climate before choosing the felt and the asphalt, tar or other roof cement so that you select the correct types for your roofing process.; ,, Asphalt works to seal the asphalt-saturated felt to make the roof waterproof.   Mop and lay another strip 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide, over the first such strip, forming a double thick, starter edge-seam. Mop full width felt over that double thick 12 inch starter across the roof.    Keep the asphalt at optimum temperature as the roll is unrolled onto the mopped, hot, liquid asphalt little by little. It is important to immediately roll felt paper into it to ensure effectiveness, as that hot liquid is the adhesive, and becomes less liquid and finally solidifies as it cools.  You can repeat the entire process of laying the asphalt saturated felt and mopping each layer with hot asphalt 3, 4 or up to 5 layers over the entire roof.  To do this, give the roof a heavy final coating of hot asphalt and then cover the entire surface with crushed-granite aggregate. The covering protects the roof from the effects of the sun, and helps protect the roof from objects such as fallen limbs.   Alternative covering: Sometimes the BUR roof is topped by spraying or rolling on a silver colored, metallic aluminum, asphaltic "paint". Another alternative: White elastomeric (rubbery) plastic coating may be used to cover the BUR.	Decide what type of low pitch, flat roof you want to install. Determine what materials you will need to complete the job. Remove the old roofing. Replace any sections of the plywood decking that have been damaged by water or "dry-rot" (fungus) before you install a new roof. Install wooden or synthetic can't strips. Lay down the felt (paper) base sheet (if required for your process). Add flashing to the roof. If BUR is legal as some cities do not allow BUR, especially on residences, then "build up roofing" layers held in place by mopping molten, hot tar or asphalt -- coal tar is a known carcinogen.Installing asphalt BUR roofing typically uses LP gas as heat, contributing to air pollution, and toxic, green-house gases are released during installation).Cut a 12 inch (30.48 cm) starter strip to mop it down as the first row of the starting edge, often the lowest edge and working up to the higher elevated part of the roof. To apply the first coat of hot asphalt over the nailed felt base, spread the hot asphalt with a large mop -- as the felt is rolled out into the mopped hot "cement", one row at a time. Continue laying each row with a 24 inch (61 cm) overlap of the one before it, using full width felt, over the entire roof for the first complete layer. Hot mop each felt as the next layer is rolled on. Optional: Finish it by spreading crushed granite aggregate (called ballast/gravel) after you've installed all of the desired layers.
One important component of your breakfast should be protein. Studies have shown that those people who had a decent amount of protein at their breakfast stayed satisfied longer and were able to maintain a healthy weight.To ensure you're eating enough protein at breakfast, aim for about 1 serving of a protein-rich food. This is about 3 – 4 oz or about 1/2 cup.Try these protein-rich foods at breakfast: lean breakfast meat (like turkey bacon, turkey sausage or ham), low-fat dairy products, smoked salmon or eggs.; , Grains are a common food group found in breakfast meals. They offer a great source of energy and can be made quickly to help you get out the door faster in the morning.   Grains, especially whole grains, are great for breakfast. They can offer a little bit of protein and fiber.The body uses carbohydrates, fat, and lastly protein for fuel. These nutrients follow different metabolic pathways to provide energy (or fuel). Carbohydrates are a great fuel source and readily broken down for use, so make sure you include them in your breakfast.Try to choose whole grains at breakfast. These are less processed and have a high nutrient content (especially fiber) compared to more refined grains. Great grain-based foods for quick breakfasts include: whole grain waffles, whole grain bread, oatmeal, whole wheat English muffins, mini whole wheat bagels or a whole grain cereal.  Another important component at breakfast is a high fiber fruit. Fruits are an easy way to get in a source of fiber and vitamins early in the morning.   Fruit is a common and tasty breakfast side dish. Including them helps balance your breakfast meal and provides an adequate source of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants to your meal.If you choose to include fruit at breakfast, make sure to measure the appropriate portion. It's one small piece of fruit or about 1/2 cup of diced fruit. You can have any fruit as a side to your meal, but you can also add fruit to your meals to make them balanced. For example, top yogurt, oatmeal or cottage cheese with 1/2 cup of fruit.  Vegetables aren't always a common food group found at breakfast; however, if you include a serving of veggies early in the morning, it can help you balance your meal and meet your daily goal of five servings per day.Like fruit, vegetables are a great source of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. Added to a lean protein, they can be a great addition to a nutrient dense meal. You can sauté vegetables and add them to eggs or add shredded vegetables to morning baked goods like zucchini muffins. 1 serving of vegetables is about 1 cup. This is a large serving, but even if you get in a 1/2 cup of vegetables, that's a great start to your day.  Meal prepping in advance is a great trick to get breakfast (and other meals) ready much quicker. Try to do a little meal prep in your down time to help get your weekday breakfasts started.   Plan a time during your week where you can spend a little time doing some meal prep. This might be right when you get home from the grocery store or on a Sunday afternoon. Write out a little list of the breakfast meals that you're planning on having during the week. This will help guide you on what foods you need to get ready. You can meal prep your entire meal if you'd like so all you need to do is eat it or heat it up. Or, you can do a moderate amount of prep work, which will require you to do minimal assembly or cooking the morning of. For example, you can make oatmeal overnight in the crockpot and just scoop out a portion in the morning or you could just slice fruit up to get ready for a smoothie.  If you are totally lacking on time, you might want to consider making breakfast the night before and making sure you can eat it on the run or when you get to work.   Right after dinner or when you have time in the evening, make your breakfast for the next morning. Many meals can be cooked or prepared completely so you can grab it and go. Keep items wrapped or in an airtight container in the refrigerator if you're storing it over night. Items you can make the night before include: scrambled egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin, yogurt or cottage cheese with fruit on top or overnight oats.  In addition to making your breakfast meal the night before, you may want to consider using your microwave to help speed along your morning. You can make a variety of breakfast items in just a minute or two if you use your microwave.   Scrambled eggs are easily cooked up in the microwave. Spray a mug with cooking spray and scramble your eggs. Microwave for about 60 seconds and your egg is completely cooked. No dirty pan! Mug muffins are a popular breakfast item. You mix together flour, eggs, butter, spices and additional topping items like nuts or fruit. Microwaved for 1-2 minutes and you have the perfect muffin. Oatmeal is an easy microwave meal. Those little instant packets make a whole grain breakfast quick and easy.  Like the microwave, your crockpot can save you loads of time on your breakfast meal. Plan to have a delicious, warm breakfast waiting for you when you wake up.   Oatmeal is not something only for the microwave. Rolled or steel cut oats take a long time to cook. Added to the crockpot overnight and you can have this wholesome grain ready and hot to go in the morning. French toast casserole is another easy crockpot meal. Using whole grain bread, you'll wake up to a fiber filled breakfast. Egg casseroles are another great dish for the crockpot. You can mix eggs, cheese, sausage or bacon and vegetables together in your crockpot. You'll have fluffy and flavorful eggs the next morning.  If you're in need of quick and nutritious breakfast items, you can always get a little help from the store. This is perfect on an overly busy week or weeks where you couldn't fit in time for food prep.   Consider purchasing frozen low calorie breakfast sandwiches or burritos. There are many varieties available in the freezer section. You can pop one of these in the microwave for a low calorie, but high protein meal. Also consider purchasing frozen sausage patties or links. You can microwave these and sandwich them in a whole grain English muffin with a piece of cheese. Also consider purchasing individual yogurts, yogurt sticks or individual cottage cheese containers. You can grab one quickly or throw in your bag to bring to work with you.  One super easy and tasty breakfast recipe is overnight oats. This is a newer and very popular way to get in a serving of fruit and whole grains at breakfast. Plus it takes just a few minutes to make and zero prep time in the morning.Stay by adding 1/2 cup of rolled oats to a mason jar or tupperware container. Add in 1/2 cup of milk (or almond or soy milk), 1/2 cup of your favorite yogurt, and 2 teaspoons of chia seeds. Mix well. To add a little extra nutrition and fiber, stir in 1/2 cup of your favorite fruit. You can try a combination of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries for a mixed berry oatmeal. Seal your container and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow to chill at least 8 hours if you can. The next morning, all you need to do is grab a spoon and enjoy.  Another great quick breakfast idea is to make and freeze your own breakfast burritos. You can make this for yourself plus all the other members of your family.To start, decide how many burritos you want to make. You'll need one 8" tortilla and 1 egg per burrito. Scrambled your eggs in a skillet over medium high heat. Remove and set aside in a bowl. If you want, you can also cook breakfast sausage, bacon or ham. Cook 1 – 2 oz of these per burrito. In addition, add some vegetables by sauteing some onions, peppers or spinach together. Again, you want about 1 oz of vegetables per burrito. Mix your eggs, vegetables and meat together in a bowl. Add in your favorite cheese (about 2 tablespoons per burrito). Stir to combine. Fill each tortilla with some of the filling. Roll up your burrito tightly and wrap in plastic wrap and stick the freezer. Morning of, defrost in the microwave for a few minutes or until heated through.  Take a little help from the store and consider purchasing whole grain waffles. They're a great source of fiber and can be cooked up quickly in the toaster.   In the morning, pull out one or two waffles (depending on how hungry your are or if you're following a specific diet). Toast according to the package instructions in your toaster. Top each waffle with 1 – 2 tablespoons of your favorite nut butter (like peanut or almond butter). Then, slice up an apple or banana (or other fruit) and lay on top of the nut butter. If you'd like, you also add a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.  Breakfast smoothies are already a somewhat quick meal to have. However, there are a few preparation steps that you can do in advance to make this go even quicker in the mornings.Start by measuring and portioning out your fruit. Per smoothie, you want about 1/2 cup of frozen fruit. Measure this out the night before or on the weekends. Place in a freezer safe plastic baggie. You can also prep the other smoothie ingredients the night before. Place 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup of your favorite yogurt in the cylinder of the blender. You can also drizzle in a tablespoon of honey if you'd like. Keep this covered and in the refrigerator. The morning of, take out the blender cylinder, add in 1 baggie of fruit and blend until smooth. Pour into a glass or a to-go cup and drink it on the way to work or school.	Always include a source of protein. Choose high-fiber grains. Try to include a serving of fruit. Add in a serving of vegetables if you can. Do food prep on the weekends. Consider making breakfast ahead. Use your microwave more often. Use your crockpot for help. Get a little help from the store. Make overnight oats. Freeze your own breakfast burritos. Toast up a whole grain waffle. Make a breakfast smoothie. Finished.
The longer it takes for water to make its way through the hose and into your pool, the warmer that water will be. While fifty feet of hose is generally sufficient, additional length means the water will have even more time to warm up. The added surface area of the hose collects more heat, as well. If you use a dark-colored hose, the water can get even warmer because dark colors absorb more solar energy.A black rubber hose is ideal and relatively inexpensive. You can also use a black garden irrigation pipe, because it’s thin walls allow for a faster heat transfer. While it is inexpensive, it will also kink easily. Both of these are available in most home supply stores.; , Point the hose directly towards the sun or mount your hose on a board that can be angled toward the sun for even more exposure.   You may want to consider mounting the hose on a board and attach it to a sun-facing roof. This is not recommended unless you have a suitable low roof, such a shed, or are skilled at working at roof height.  Use a hose that is ⅝ or ½ inch in diameter to slowly fill the pool. Try keeping the stream around half an inch in diameter to allow it to take in heat while still filling the pool at a decent rate.   Always fill up your pool on a sunny day to take the most advantage of the sun’s energy.	Use a long, dark-colored hose to fill up your pool. Make sure the hose is in direct sunlight.When filling your pool, make sure the hose gets full sun exposure to absorb as much energy as possible. Fill the pool slowly with a thin hose.A thinner stream of water will heat more quickly when filling your pool.
