Which form do you prefer? Makashi? Soresu? Djem So? Something else? Particular forms work better with different lightsaber styles.; , A short person would have real trouble wielding a lightclub. A strong person probably doesn't want to use a curved-hilt lightsaber. Certain lightsabers require certain physical traits to wield effectively.  Pacifist Jedi were disapproving of weapons such as the saberstaff, calling them "more slaughter per swing". Sith, on the other hand, loved weapons like this. More aggressive people probably want lightsabers that do greater damage, and more pacifist people should choose sabers better suited to defense (funnily enough, a saberstaff fits both these requirements).  Quarterstaff or bo staff training lends itself well to saberstaff wielding. Whip users can become lightwhip users. Ever practised with one of those batons that policemen (or stormtrooper TR-8R) use - the one with a handle sticking out of the side? Look no further than the guard shoto.	Look at your combat style. Consider your physique. Look at your philosophy. Consider your training with other weapons.
Combine 1 part ammonia and 1 part water in a spray bottle, then close the spray bottle and shake. Spray the ammonia spray around entry points in your house and other places where spiders tend to gather. Reapply the spray every week.Instead of making a spray, you can also dip a cloth in the solution and use it to wipe around the entry points of your house for a more concentrated application.  Combine one part vinegar to two parts water in a spray bottle and shake to mix. Spray the vinegar spray around doorways, window frames, or other points of entry in your house, reapplying the spray every week for the best results., Pour half an ounce (14.78 ml) of salt into a half gallon (1.89 liters) of warm water and mix until the salt is dissolved. Then pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Use the spray on points of entry to deter spiders, reapplying the spray once a week.Spraying salt water directly on a spider can kill it.  Fill a spray bottle almost to the top with hot water, then add a healthy pinch of tobacco. Allow the tobacco to soak into and infuse the water for about an hour, then spray the mixture around the entry points of your home. The strong smell of the tobacco will drive away unwanted spiders.	Make an ammonia repellent. Make a vinegar spray. Make a saltwater spray. Create a tobacco spray.
It is much easier to hit a fly that is not moving. Be stealthy! The fly is probably scoping you out as much as you're scoping it out.   If it's in a position you don't like, wreak havoc around it. It'll be forced to go into a different, hopefully, more open area. If you know it's somewhere but don't know where, turn off the TV and anything else that's making noise. This will enable you to hear the fly and track it more easily once it takes to the air.; , Get close enough to be able to swing and hit the fly, but not so close that it startles the fly into flying around again.   This takes some skill. You are up against an evasion artist. Before the fly takes off, it is executing a complex pre-flight routine: precise leg-to-eye positioning is taking place moment-by-moment. The extraordinary eyes (viewing field nearly 360Â°) pinpoint your location and the fly's nervous system translates this perception into precise leg positioning. These optimize instant take-off in the most likely evasive direction.And this is why it often seems that the fly is blessed with precognitive powers.  You'll need to be able to swing fast and accurately. If flies are a constant problem, start practicing your aim and stealth (and clean up and shut your windows and doors).   The fly is planning to fly away at the last second. What you have to do is to predict where it is going to fly and aim there. You're going to beat him at his own game. Try to get him into a corner to limit his possibly flyaway zone.  Be sure to clean up the remains of the fly after swatting it. Or you could leave it, completely creep out your family, and leave a stain on the wall.   You may want to use Windex, Pledge, or some sort of cleaner. This goes double if your victim was one of those huge, bulbous, super-buzzy flies.	Wait until the fly is stationary. Sneak up behind the fly. Swing at the fly. Clean up the mess.

Hence, diversion of public resources by filing false information about members of family or giving fictitious addresses is wrong and will cause you to be liable under section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act. Such applicants may be liable for criminal prosecution and consequent punishment under the law. Therefore, applicants are requested to file correct information about members of family living with them to avoid the following the prevention of inclusion of family members who are already included in any other family card in Tamil Nadu or elsewhere.   File correct addresses. Disclose information on LPG connections. Desist from applying for a new card, when the family is in possession of another family card elsewhere or in the same address.  In Chennai City, all requests should be forwarded to the zonal assistant commissioner. Find the appropriate AC office at http://www.consumer.tn.gov.in/telephone-numbers.pdf and submit the application with Rs.5/- as fee court fee stamp with all annexes stated in earlier step.  The application filed by you will be sent for field verification. The officer carrying out the field verification is supposed to inspect the applicant's house and kitchen to ensure that the applicant is living and cooking separately and also to verify the use of LPG by the family. When the officer reports at the applicant's house, the applicant may ask the officer for proof of identity (official ID card) before letting him inspect the premises.   Civil supplies and the Consumer Protection department is very concerned about the integrity of the officers and conduct in public offices. Applicants are free to report any indecorous behavior or demand for payment of bribes by any inspecting or office staff of the department by telephone or email to the commissioner, civil supplies and consumer protection.

In case the inspection by the officer concerned does not happen within 30 days, speak to the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer concerned. Thereafter, if the application is found acceptable by the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer as per the above eligibility conditions, then the application is approved and sent for the family card to be printed.  After approval by assistant commissioner, applicants are requested not to get in touch with the AC or TSO offices (unless filing additional documents) earlier than 30 days, to avoid unnecessary workload on the offices of this department. This will enable the department to serve you better.   As soon as the application is filed, the applicant must collect the acknowledgement slip with the office seal, date of application, serial number and date of final disposal. The Government of Tamil Nadu has fixed the time limit for passing orders on applications for new ration as 60 days from the date of application. Once the application is found eligible for issue of a new family card, the card is sent for printing. As soon as the printed card arrives in the office, the Assistant Commissioner or Taluk Supply Officer has to send a post card to the applicant requesting him/her to collect the ration card in person with the acknowledgement slip within 15 days. In case the application is rejected, the assistant commissioner or Taluk supply officer has to send a post card to the applicant indicating the reasons for rejection within 60 days of the application date.

Put a small amount of an alcohol-based cleaner such as cheap hairspray or rubbing alcohol on an inconspicuous spot on the wood. Wipe the area clean and let it dry.  Use enough hairspray or other alcohol-based cleaner to fully cover the stain.If youâre using hairspray, cheap hairspray is best, as it contains a higher percentage of alcohol than more expensive hairsprays. Use cotton swabs to apply the hairspray or other household item, especially if the ink stain is a thin line.  Choose a cloth that you donât mind getting stained, since the ink will transfer to this cloth. Blot gently by pressing the cloth into the stained area. Do not rub it around or scrub, as this can spread the stain.   Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the carpet., Use lukewarm water to rinse the carpet thoroughly. Dip an old clean cloth into a bowl of water and wring out some of the excess water. Dab this cloth on the cleaned stain area to help rinse the carpet.   You may need to do this rinsing process several times to fully remove the hairspray.  Leave the carpet overnight to give it time to dry. Turn up the heat in the room to help speed up the drying process. Vacuum the rug to remove any excess cleaning debris.	Pretest the cleaning product. Cover the stain with an alcohol-based household product. Blot with a white towel or cloth. Rinse with water and allow to dry. Let the carpet dry and vacuum.
Fetch a roll of duct tape, electrical tape, or any other type that is totally opaque. Open your shoebox. Hold it up to a light source to see if any cracks, joins, or holes are permitting light to enter the box from the outside. If so, cover those areas with tape to keep all unnecessary light out. Do the same with the cover to the shoebox.  Use a pencil or pen to trace a 1âx1â (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) hole on one of the boxâs smaller ends. Place it near the edge of the boxâs bottom, but leave about a half-inch of space between the hole and the edge so you donât accidentally tear the edge when you make your cut. Use a utility blade to cut the hole along your outline.For safetyâs sake, always have the sharp end of the blade facing away from you in case it slips.  Cut out a piece of tin or aluminum foil that is slightly larger than your hole. Cover the hole from the inside and tape the foilâs edges to the inside of the box. Use a pin, needle, or thumbtack to prick a very tiny hole in the foil. Aim for the center.Make sure the foil is pulled taut when you tape it. Otherwise, you may end up only pushing the foil with your pin or needle instead of poking a hole through it.  Place it inside the box, directly across from the foil, in the exact same position along the boxâs other smaller end. Tape it in place along its edges. Close the box with its cover once you finish.When the foil end is aimed at the eclipse, the sunlight should penetrate the foil through the hole you poked and then strike the piece of paper that you just taped up at the opposite end, just like a film projector aimed at a theater screen.  Trace another 1âx1â (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) outline to cut along one of the boxâs longer sides. Use your utility blade to cut the hole out. Peer inside and make sure you have a clear view of the white screen.If you placed both the foil and the white screen near the bottom of the box, you can judge the best angle for viewing the screen from the top before closing the box. If the lid to your box is totally detachable, you can also use other lids to cut new viewing holes if your first attempt does not provide a good view of the screen.  Seal the lid with opaque tape to keep any more light from creeping into the box. Just before the eclipse begins, aim the foil end of the box at the sun. Check its shadow to make sure the box is lined up perfectly with the sun. As the eclipse begins, peer into the box through the viewing hole. Look for a circle of light projected onto the white screen. Track the moonâs shadow over this circle of light as the moon passes between Earth and the sun.	Block all light from entering the shoebox. Create a square hole to aim at the eclipse. Cover the hole. Add a âscreen.â Cut out a piece of plain white paper that is roughly the same size as your foil. Cut a square viewing hole. Use your box.
If your extended family is too large for you to see everyone on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, use Boxing Day to include them in your holidays. Have a formal holiday feast or keep true to the more relaxed spirit of Boxing Day and have a simpler get-together.Popular food served as a Boxing Day meal includes leftover Christmas turkey served as sandwiches or another full meal, or alternately a cold ham or roast beef served as a buffet to minimize prep and cooking.In the UK and Canada, many restaurants welcome large parties for Boxing Day carveries, or buffets serving roast meats carved to order.  If youâve already checked family off your list of holiday duties, feel free to make Boxing Day a time to spend with friends instead. Go to a sporting event or watch one at the local pub. Or just hang out together at someoneâs home., Put the formality of the holidays behind you. Host a potluck where everyoneâs free to get rid of their leftovers. Make it a pajama party if you want to make it even less formal and more inviting. Tune into the football marathon on TV, zone out, and be merry., Since sports and exercise are such a large part of Boxing Day, stay in the spirit and have the whole family get some exercise. Use this extra time together to go for a long hike through the woods or walk through the streets., Take the young kids to see this family-friendly piece of lively theater based on fairy tales, which is traditionally performed on Boxing Day. Sing along with the musical numbers and interact with the performers onstage.	Visit family. Spend time with friends. Keep it casual. Go on an outing. Attend a pantomime.
Larger hearts require thicker, longer strips of paper, whereas smaller, delicate hearts will come from thinner, shorter strips.   Avoid using construction paper for this project, as it is too heavy and wonât curl properly.  No template is needed for this projectââeach heart is created from a strip of the quilling paper. Just make sure that you have an even measurement/edge on each strip. Note that a symmetrical heart has an equal width on each strip.  Each heart should be created the same way, using your pencil and clean fingers.   Fold the paper strip in half. Make sure that the ends meet up evenly and you have a firm crease in the middle of the paper strip. Place your pencil or pen side along the top of one of the paper strips. Hold the paper strip firmly next to the pencil. Wind the pencil and paper downward toward the center crease of the paper. Wind halfway down the middle of the folded paper strip and then slowly remove the pencil. Repeat the curling step on the other paper strip. Curl inward and stop halfway down.  These can be glued onto cards, posters, etc., or glued together in a chain for a garland or wreath, etc.	Determine the sizes of the paper hearts before cutting the paper. Cut the paper strips. Create the heart. Finished.
What's the worst part of this? The demolition. Cost: $1,000 or more.  DIY is great for many things, but it is virtually impossible to do a decent bathtub refinishing job by yourself. Porcelain, fiberglass, and cast-iron tubs can all be refinished.  But they are always cheaper than full replacement, and unlike refinishing, you never worry about the finish wearing away.  Nearly impossible to achieve a smooth finish, and DIY finishes will begin to peel and chip soon after.	Replacement: Tear out your existing tub/shower and replace. Refinishing: Refinishing is a hire-the-pro project. Tub Liners: At prices equal to or greater than refinishing, bathtub liners are not the bargain option. DIY Refinishing: Worth mentioning as something you probably do not want to take on.
While this folding technique will do wonders for preventing wrinkles during the traveling process, it can't do anything for wrinkles or stains that are already there. To ensure your suit jacket is in tip-top shape, send it to the dry cleaner's at least a week before you leave and ensure the cleaner presses the suit in addition to removing any stains.   If you're pressed for time, you may want to iron the suit yourself. If you do so, ensure the lapels are well-ironed - it's possible to hide wrinkles elsewhere on the suit, but nearly impossible to hide them on the lapels.; , Turn the fabric of your jacket around so that the lining is on the outside. This protects the actual outer fabric of the jacket - now, if the jacket incurs any wrinkles while traveling, they're likely to be on the inside of the jacket when you wear it.  Next, put your hand inside the coat and push your fist into the shoulders so that the lining of the shoulders "pops" out. These inside-out shoulders make the jacket much easier to fold - if you hadn't popped them out, you would have to deal with the awkwardness of inward-facing shoulder pads.  Gather both shoulders in one hand and use the other to grasp the jacket at the midpoint of its collar. This should have the effect of folding the jacket in half lengthwise. Straighten the material of the jacket out after folding - the liner should still be on the outside.  Place your forearm horizontally across the middle of the jacket and fold the top of the jacket over. This should create a roughly square "bundle" that fits easily in a suitcase.  To protect your jacket in your luggage, it's a wise idea to place it in a plastic bag separate from other clothing. Slide the square, folded "bundle" that your jacket is in into a large plastic bag (like a dry cleaning bag or a large ziplock bad). Seal the bag carefully. If you don't have a bag handy, use a sheet of sturdy plastic material. Place the folded jacket in the middle of the sheet and fold the sides in and under the jacket.          If you're using a plastic bag, try to trap a little air in the bag with the suit. This protective "bubble" can prevent the other clothes in the suitcase from pressing into the jacket, eliminating wrinkles.  Try keep the suit as flat as possible and to avoid compressing it. To minimize wrinkling, place only other flat, folded items of clothing on top of the jacket. Avoid placing hard, awkwardly-shaped items like shoes on top of the jacket.  When you arrive at your destination, you'll want to essentially do the steps above in reverse. Remove any clothes on top of the jacket, open its bag, undo the horizontal and vertical folds in it, and turn the fabric right-side out. Wrinkling should be minimal - to combat any wrinkles that remain, hang the suit immediately.   For persistent wrinkles, try hanging the jacket in the bathroom. When you take a shower, the warmth and steam will loosen the fabric, helping to release any difficult wrinkles.  The simplest option when it comes to folding pants for traveling is to make only vertical, lengthwise folds. This strategy is best for pants with "pleats" - vertical folds sewn into the fabric along the waist of the pants. If your pants have pleats, fold vertically along these. This way, even if the fold sets into the pants as a wrinkle, the long, continuous vertical wrinkles will look like the result of ironing.   You may also fold the pants in half vertically to further save space.  One of the big disadvantages of folding pants only vertically is that many suitcases simply aren't big enough to stretch the entire pant leg out in. If you're pressed for space, try rolling your pants. Fold the pants in half vertically and lay them on a clean, flat surface. Starting at the bottom, roll the pant legs into a tight bundle. This prevents wrinkles by exposing a minimum of the pants' surface area to other items in the suitcase and makes the pants take up relatively little space.  If you can, you'll want to avoid folding dress pants horizontally, as this can contribute to creases that can't be explained away as the result of ironing. However, if you do fold your pants horizontally (this is usually done after folding the pants once vertically), you can minimize by wrinkles by following the same rules as listed above for suit jackets - place only flat, folded items on top of them, place them in a bag if possible, and so on.   One great idea for pants folded horizontally is to "sandwich" them within the two sides of the folded suit jacket. This provides them the protection of the inside-out jacket fabric as well as the jacket's bag.  You don't necessarily have to button every button - just enough to keep the front of the shirt closed. Next, lay the shirt face down with its material spread flat and its sleeves stretched out.   If you happen to have extra dry cleaning bags, you may want to lay one squarely in the middle of the back of the shirt. This prevents the shirt from pressing against itself while folded, reducing the chance of wrinkles.  Make two vertical folds along the back of the shirt to bring the edges of the shirt roughly one sleeve-length inward. Straighten the edges of the shirt so that they are uniform and parallel.  Next, take each sleeve and fold it down so that it lines up with the folded edges of the shirt. The edges of the sleeve should be roughly in line with both the new outer edge of the shirt and with the edge of the shirt material that has been folded inward. Make minor adjustments, straightening the fabric as necessary until it lines up perfectly.   At this point, a good rule of thumb is that the shirt's shoulders should now be shortened so that only an inch or two of material is left on either side of the collar.  Like with dress pants, long, continuous vertical creases look better on dress shirts than horizontal folds do. The former resemble the types of creases that can result from ironing, while the latter generally look like nothing other than what they are. Because of this, if you have room in your suitcase, you may want to place the shirt in now, rather than after the next fold.   If you have a bag that's big enough to hold the shirt in its current partly-folded state, use it. If not, you can try bunching up the bottom of the shirt in the bag - since this part of your shirt will be covered by your jacket, it's not as important for it to be 100% wrinkle-free.  If you don't have enough space to put your shirt in your suitcase halfway-folded or simply aren't worried about wrinkles, continue folding. Grab the bottom edge of the shirt (including the sleeves) and bring it up to the shoulders. Flip the shirt over - it should be a nice, tidy square with the collar and buttons centered in the middle.   If you laid a dry cleaning bag in the middle of your shirt at the beginning of this method, it will protect your shirt from pressing against itself at this point. You can also get a similar effect by slipping a flat cardboard insert between the two halves of the folded shirt.  Place the folded shirt in a dry cleaning bag or a large ziplock bag and seal the bag. As noted above, you may want to trap a small amount of air in the bag along with the shirt to create a protective bubble that can help prevent the other items in the suitcase from pressing on the shirt.  Ensure the shirt sits face-up in the suitcase and that nothing heavy or hard is packed on top of it. Ideally, the shirt should be surrounded with flat, folded fabric clothing.   Upon arrival, unpack your suitcase and inspect your shirt for wrinkles. Hang the shirt immediately or iron.	Clean and press your suit before you travel. Turn the jacket inside out. Pop the shoulders inside out. Fold the jacket vertically. Fold the jacket in half horizontally. Place the jacket in a plastic bag. Lay the wrapped jacket in your suitcase. Unfold your jacket at your destination. Fold the pants along their pleats. Roll the pants to save space. Fold horizontally with caution. To begin, button the shirt and lay it face-down on a flat surface. Fold the edges of the shirt inward. Fold the sleeves down along the new edges. Consider packing the shirt as-is. Fold the shirt horizontally in half. Place the shirt in a bag. Lay the shirt in your suitcase.
When stalking your friend, be sure to dress for the weather. You don't want to stand out with a trench coat and an elaborate mustache disguise.   Use common sense: if you're stalking your friend at a beach in the hot summer, wear a bathing suit; if you're stalking him/her in the rain, wear a rain jacket and carry an umbrella. If you're stalking at night, wearing dark clothing may help you remain unseen; however, in the event you are spotted you will seem more suspicious. Many people walk/jog/run at night, so athletic clothing may be a good choice. Don't dress flashy: err on the side of muted colors.Don't overthink your attire: dress like everyone else.; , Your friend obviously knows what you look like and how you normally dress, so you'll probably want to alter your appearance slightly.   Depending on how determined you are, you could go to a thrift store and buy some inexpensive clothing so that your friend won't recognize your usual style. Wearing a hoodie can be effective, but it can also make you stand out, particularly when wearing a hoodie up draws attention. If you normally wear your hair a certain way, try styling it differently. If it doesn't feel like you, that's a good thing because it probably doesn't look like you either. If you're not usually a hat person, wearing a hat will definitely make you unrecognizable to your friend at a quick glance. Don't go for an elaborate disguise: less is more in this case. You don't want to draw attention to yourself.  Your friend is going to recognize your face, so consider wearing something to slightly obscure it.   If it's sunny, consider buying a cheap pair of sunglasses to cover your eyes. If it's cold out, wear a scarf that can cover the bottom half of your face. If you wear make-up, perhaps apply it differently, maybe thicker.  In some cases, you may need additional supplies for your stealth operation. Here are some supplies you might consider bringing along in a backpack:   Binoculars. Although good for observing from long distances in nature, in urban areas binoculars will probably stand out. A long-distance lens. A camera with a long-distance lens is good for observing your friend from afar just as long as you're not always focused on him/her: make it look like you're an amateur photographer taking pictures.A spare outfit. If your friend spots you but doesn't recognize you, that's a good time to change your outfit (and personal effects) because if he/she spots you again in the same clothing he/she will definitely become suspicious.  Before you start stalking your friend, think up a reason for why you are where you are. In the event your friend notices and confronts you, this will be your explanation.This is especially important when stalking at night, when there are fewer people around to blend in with and there are fewer reasons to be outside. Here are some ideas for explanations: you dropped something; you're looking for lost pet; you're lost; you're walking home (from somewhere).  Where you're stalking your friend (e.g. a beach, a store, a restaurant) should determine your behavior -- which should appear natural to the environment.   If your friend is shopping, you, too, should appear to be shopping. But if your friend is shopping at store where you might stand out (e.g. for women: a cigar shop; for men: a lingerie shop), then perhaps a better idea would be to wait casually outside for him/her to emerge.If you don't know how to act in a certain place, remember: do what everyone else is doing.  This doesn't mean crouching behind bushes or diving into garbage cans. Rather, use cover appropriately for the situation. Here are some examples:   If you're at a bookstore and your friend is approaching your direction, lower your face into the book as though you were short-sighted. If you're at the park, leaning behind a tree is normal behavior -- so use that tree for cover! If your environment offers no suitable cover, use your phone: hold it low and bow your head to hide your face. People do this all the time, so you'll look normal. Remember that you never know who else might be watching you, so avoid suspicious crouching and hiding even when you think you're unseen.  Even if you're only following your friend walking down the street, appear engaged in either your thoughts or the sights.   Very few people stare straight ahead while they walk, so don't always keep your eyes trained on your friend. As it is seldom done and will likely broadcast your stalking hijinks, eye contact is the wrong kind of engagement, especially with the friend whom you are stalking.  Approaching too closely increases the risk of your friend spotting you, so keep just close enough so that you can always see them.If you're following your friend by car, keep a few car distances behind you and them, with cars in between. Remember, all you need is enough of a distance to see where they're headed and not to lose them if they turn.If you're in nature (e.g. the woods), one way of keeping your distance while observing your friend is to use binoculars or a long-distance camera lens.A greater distance between you and your target might be necessary at night due to the absence of other people.  Rather than a "hawk's gaze," you should keep a "soft focus" on your friend because you don't want to alert suspicion or make eye-contact if they were to turn toward you unexpectedly.   A "soft focus" utilizes your peripheral vision, so that where your nose is pointing isn't necessarily where you're actually looking., Managing the sound you make is most important when you're stalking at night, as there typically are fewer people around at that time.   Walking quietly is largely a matter of balance: keep your legs bent and practice slow, heel-to-toe steps on the outer edge of your feet.Watch where you step so that you don't accidentally step on something, such as a branch, and alert your friend to your presence.  If you see that your friend has spotted and identified you, running away will only raise his/her suspicions when you don't really know if they're even suspicious yet.  Don't overdo it, but be surprised to have run into them. If you're feeling really confident, you could even act like you're delighted to see them, which will probably shake them of the suspicion that you were following them.  When your friend asks why you are where you are, give your explanation that you planned beforehand.  If your friend doesn't believe your planned explanation, your last chance at saving face is to act incredulous at their incredulity. If you get the urge to laugh, let it out because the situation is indeed ridiculous.  If your friend refuses to believe your planned explanation and your incredulity, the jig is probably up and it's time to tell them the truth about what you were doing.	Wear appropriate clothing. Consider a slight disguise. Obscure your face. Bring some supplies. Prepare an explanation. Act appropriately. Use cover casually. Appear engaged. Keep your distance. Keep a "soft focus" on your friend. Be quiet and stealthy. Don't run away. Show surprise. Use your planned explanation. Act incredulous. Tell the truth.
First, make some lemon paste. Then, scrub this paste all over the sippy cups. Pay particular attention to the areas that have a stinky smell. Some parents will even let the lemon paste remain in the cup overnight.To dissolve the lemon paste, rinse it with hot water.  Fill the sink with hot water and squirt a few drops of dishwashing liquid into it. Submerge the sippy cups in the water and wash the cups thoroughly, using the brush that you prefer. Cotton swabs and pipe cleaners are perfect for the small crannies that are hard to reach with a regular brush.   However, avoid using dishwashing soap that will leave an after taste on the sippy cup; your child may refuse to use the cup if it has a bad taste.  Place some denture cleaning tablets in a bowl or container. Full the container with water and immerse the sippy cups in the mixture. Let the cups sit in the water while the tablets fizz.You can purchase denture tablets over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.  Boil the vinegar then put all the sippy cups into it. Soak these cups for a few minutes. Remove and let them cool on a dishtowel.   After this, you can wash them again using a dishwashing soap for a thorough cleaning.  You can do this by putting two to three tablespoons of baking soda into each sippy cup. Fill the inside of the sippy cup with boiling or hot water. Let the baking soda stay in the cup overnight. Wash the cups with water and soap to complete the cleaning process.	Use lemon paste. Wash your sippy cups with dish soap solution. Try using denture cleaning tablets. Wash the sippy cups with vinegar. Use baking soda.
Everyone will find a different method of holding a pencil which feels best. But there are some basics to help you find your sweet spot.   Place the pencil between your forefinger and thumb on your dominant hand. For basic drawing, you donât want to hold your pencil too close to the tip or you wonât be able to move it enough. Likewise, holding it too far back wonât give you enough control. Try holding it a few centimeters up from the tip. About a fourth of the way up. Keep a loose enough grip so that you can move your fingers, hand, and wrist. When drawing a line, use your fingers. Think if it like a small flicking motion. When drawing a curve or circular shape, use your wrist, while keeping your fingers in place. Though it feels weird a lot of the time, try to keep your pencil connected to the paper. Even when drawing a circle. Lift your wrist off the paper and practice making a continuous loop. Donât make small jagged lines. A lot of the time, novice artists will make small dashes, trying to connect each one as the pencil progresses. This wonât make your drawing look smooth. Though it may feel weird, and harder to draw longer lines and curves without lifting your pencil, keep practicing. Once you get used to the feeling, your lines will look much better. Sometimes, you want to grip the pencil in your palm when shading. This technique lets you use the edge of your pencil to create a smoother shade and gives you more control on the amount of pressure you apply.; , Most of what you are doing when drawing is using your pen, pencil, or another tool to define the edges and contours of forms. These forms can be anything from a coffee mug on a table, to a superhero flying between tall skyscrapers.   Begin with a pencil. When training yourself to draw, a pencil will be your best friend. You can control how dark or light a line will be. You can also easily erase any mistakes you make and correct your drawings. A lot of what you draw is essentially made up of shapes like circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, and triangles. Your art will incorporate these shapes in different ways to form an image. Practice drawing these shapes. See how well you can sketch out these shapes with a freehand. Get a feel for how your hand moves the pencil on the paper. Keep practicing until you can draw these basic shapes well. Practice shading. Draw a 20 centimetres (7.9Â in) x 2 centimetres (0.79Â in) rectangle. You can use a ruler if youâd like. Divide your rectangle into boxes which are each 2 centimetres (0.79Â in) wide. You will have 10 blocks. Number these blocks going left to right, starting at 1. Leave the first block blank. Then very lightly shade the second block. As you continue to each new block, make it a darker shade until the last box is colored in black. You will now have a shading gradient as a reference guide. , Depending on how realistic you intend your drawing to be, you sometimes want to have hard outlines for your shapes. This is good for a lot of cartoon drawing. For drawing more realistic objects, you may want to use shading to soften your outlines to edges. Outlines are are made by going over the outside lines of your object again with your pencil or pen and tracing over these lines with more pressure to give your object a solid outline and shape. This will make an object look more two-dimensional. Edges are created by shading your object so that the darkest part of the shade is the same as your outline. As you shade farther away from the edge, lighten your shade. This will make your object look more three-dimensional.  Whether youâre an experienced artist, or just starting out, getting back to basics is a great way to improve your drawing skills. A great way to get back to basics is to simply draw what you see around you. As you do, pay attention to light and shading.   Everyoneâs seen countless drawings of bowls of fruit or a coffee mug on the table. This is because drawing these objects helps you to understand how to shade an object, incorporate depth, and light. Find something near you like a bowl, fruit, or even your smartphone and practice drawing it on paper. Look at how the light source casts a shadow on and around the object. You can tell where a light source is coming from because the shadow will be pointing opposite the light. Practice drawing an object you are looking at using shapes. Dissect the object and break it down into your basic shapes. If you are looking at a coffee mug, think about the different shapes that make up the mug. The main part of the mug is a cylinder, made up of a rectangle with a curved bottom, and an oval to show the curved top which is open. Practice drawing these shapes together to form the main part of your mug. Next, look at the handle. The handle is like a half circle or oval. Donât worry about having your lines overlap or not making everything even. You can always erase and adjust. Use your pencil to help you measure the proportions of what youâre drawing. If you line up your pencil to the coffee mug and see that the mug is about Â¾ the height of the pencil when your pencil is vertical, and the width of the mug is slightly less the Â¾ of the length of the pencil when itâs horizontal, you can use that knowledge to help you get the proportions correct on paper. Once you draw your vertical lines, use your pencil to make sure the distance between the two is relative to the width.  Take some time to read up on the different styles, techniques and ideas that inspired these artists. What about these experiences or techniques excites your interests? There should be plenty of ideas and approaches to enthuse you to learn from.   Books and videos that teach you how to draw using techniques on perspective, construction, anatomy, and color theory will help you hone your own skill. These kinds of material can not only provide you with exercises to practice in a visual way but can also help you discover what kind of drawer you are. These types of reference materials will help you with step-by-step instructions or techniques that you can learn to improve your ability.  Drawing the objects, places, and even things from pop culture you like will help you hone your skill. This is because you will naturally pay more attention to the details of what you are looking at, and take more time when drawing it. Your natural interest in drawing a great rendition of something you like will help you understand how lines and shapes work. How shading is incorporated, and so on.   Draw the cartoons you like. If you like a certain cartoon or comic, and like that art style, practice emulating that style in your own drawings. Drawing your favorite characters in a certain style will give you an idea of whatâs easier and harder for you. Perhaps you find that youâre not as good at drawing very realistic objects or characters. But that anime or cartoon styled drawings come much easier.  After you've done some research and practiced drawing what you like, move out of your comfort zone and try other drawing styles. You might feel comfortable with one method of drawing but if you don't try other styles, you'll never know if there are other styles that fit your skills well. Or styles that you can blend into your own mix.   Branching out will help you discover what you are good at and what you are not. You may find that you can draw beautiful, colorful cartoons, but have a difficult time drawing realistic figures. Donât discount an art style just because youâre not good at it. Keep practicing it and use this as a chance to improve on areas where you are having a hard time. Pick a piece of art or drawing, that is outside of your comfort zone. Then try to recreate it by looking at it. Doing this will give you an idea of where you are having trouble, and it will force you to figure out how to get better. By drawing something that is hard for you, you will train your brain and hand to discover the movements your pencil needs to make. Attempting different drawing styles will also help your own style to emerge naturally over time. You can't force a certain style, it has to develop.  If you have always been drawing in pencil, try charcoal. Or switch to watercolor pencils, colored pencils, or ink.   While a pencil is great for sketching out the first part of a drawing, and sometimes doing the whole drawing, other tools may suit you better. You may find that you have more control with markers, pens, or paint. Or that your personal style really seems to fit a certain medium. Perhaps your style looks ok in just pencil, but once you add a pen, and are able to play with the thickness of the penâs stroke, you see that your style really comes through.  Artists use colors to evoke a certain mood or atmosphere. Colors are used to create space and light and shadow. Therefore, playing with not only what colors you use in your drawings but how you use these colors, will help you get better and create a style all your own. Look at your favorite comics, cartoons, artists, etc. Notice how color is used in these drawings. Are there bright, happy colors in a shot of Batman as he jumps from a roof in downtown Gotham? Or are the colors darker, more muted? In Batman, the colors are darker and muted to enhance the noir-like tone. Practice with color pencils to get a sense of how your use of color can be incorporated into your drawings. As you use your color pencils, take the time to study your drawing. Does your drawing look better because of the color, or worse? Learn to use color to depict temperature and shades. Blue hues are cooler for example. The darker the blue and the closer to black, the colder the temperature is. , If you truly want to become a better drawer, like every skill, you have to practice, practice, practice. Draw every day, whether itâs a doodle for ten minutes, or a larger piece of art you work on for several hours.   As you continue to draw, youâll notice where your strengths lie, and where you can improve. Look at your drawings and analyze each one. Take note of what is common throughout your drawings. Are you always drawing cartoons? Or do you frequently only draw part of someoneâs body, like the face and head, but never the rest? Spend more time on the types of things you avoid when drawing. If you have a hard time drawing hands, look up tutorials on how to draw hands, and practice drawing just hands over and over. Then, once youâve improved, incorporate your new skill into your art.  While you may draw pictures that donât have a human, animal, or human-like figure, chances are a lot of drawings do. Use your own body as a guide.   Say youâre drawing a character youâve created in action. Picturing and sketching the body in movement, or even standing still, can be tough. Itâs not always easy to draw correct proportions or get the placement of body parts right. Position your own body in the pose you are trying to draw. Look at yourself in the mirror or take a picture. Having this kind of reference will help you get a visual understanding of how the body moves, how the arms look in a certain position. What the head looks like when turned at a certain angle.  After mastering the techniques of drawing objects, adding depth, texture and form, the composition is the real telling point of an advanced drawer. The composition can be dull even if your drawing technique is excellent; the real art is found in careful and well-spaced composition. Composition is the spatial relationship of your objects within a frame. Being able to draw with a good sense of space and distance between objects is a skill that takes time. Use real life examples to help you use composition in your art. Say youâre drawing a fence going off into the distance. The gaps between each post will be slightly different. Give objects different sizes and space within your drawing. If youâre drawing a crowd of people, not everyone will be the same height and width. And if some are closer to the eye, or further off in the distance, the size of the person and the detail will vary. Use the rule of thirds. This means dividing your paper into nine equal sections. Your paper is divided horizontally into three sections, and vertically in three sections. Align your areas of focus near the intersections of your imaginary lines. Say you are drawing a person sitting in a chair in a room. You may consider drawing the head in the top left area where your top and left thirds intersect. This is an area of focus and will draw the eye to your personâs face. You might leave the right third of your paper emptier with fewer details and objects to show depth to the room and balance out your drawing.  Some people can draw quickly, and fill in details with ease. But the only way youâll improve your ability is if you take your time and draw slowly at first. The slower you go the more control you have. You can pay more attention to the slight curve of a line, or get the details of that hand just right.   It may get frustrating to go slowly as you draw, but it makes a big difference. Look at a drawing you did quickly, then go and draw again, this time going slowly, notice the difference. The more you draw, and the more time you take to care for your drawing will be your biggest advantage to becoming a better drawer. Once youâve learned the basics of drawing, it really comes to down to practice and patience.	Learn to hold your pencil. Practice basic drawing techniques. Practice drawing edges and outlines. Draw what you see around you. Study books and videos about and from famous illustrators. Draw what you like. Attempt different drawing styles. Change medium. Play with color. Draw every day. Use anatomy as a guide. Work on composition. Take your time.
The best way to get rid of ladybugs is to remove them physically using a vacuum cleaner. If you cut the hose off with nylon stocking material, you might be able to create a trap using your vacuum. Trap the ladybugs inside by vacuuming them up and let them go back outside.   Use a hose attachment on the vacuum cleaner rather than the bottom push function. Put the toe end of the stockings over the end of the vacuum hose, with the leg portion of the stocking inside the hose. Secure the end in place with a rubber band. As you vacuum up the ladybugs, they will get trapped inside the stocking leg. Carefully pull the stocking out and release the ladybugs outside. Make sure that the stocking does not get sucked into the vacuum cleaner. If you cannot block the collection bin or department with nylon, make sure that the bag or canister is empty before vacuuming the bugs up. That way, you can still release the ladybugs outside without dumping a bunch of dirt and debris out along with them.; , If you do this, the ladybug is likely to secrete a yellow substance that can stain skin, clothes, and other surfaces.   Contrary to popular belief, the yellow secretions left by ladybugs is blood, not waste. When a ladybug feels threatened, it leaves behind a small amount of blood as a warning and defense tactic., Use a broom to sweep the ladybugs outside if they are close to a door.   With this method, you still run the risk of startling the ladybugs and causing them to excrete yellow fluid. As such, you should only do it if the insects are only a short distance away from a door or window.  While light traps offer limited help, setting one or two up in a dark attic or dark basement can attract and trap a few of the ladybugs hiding out in these locations.   Note that these light traps will only take care of a fraction of the problem and are usually only effective on ladybugs living in confined, dark spaces. Light traps are not very effective when used in living spaces during the fall or spring.  Scatter the DE in locations you suspect ladybugs to travel in and around. It can be applied both inside and outside.   Food grade DE is recommended since it will be safer to use around pets and kids. That said, you should prevent your kids and pets from coming into contact with the DE. DE contains shards of sharp algae. These cut into the exoskeleton of the ladybug as the insect crosses over the DE, ultimately causing the bug to die from being unable to hold in moisture or hydration.  Mix either one with a little water in a spray bottle and spritz it around areas that you suspect ladybugs to be hiding out at. The sprays should drive the ladybugs away without killing them.   Ladybugs are sensitive to the strong odors of camphor and menthol. While these odors do not kill the insects, these bugs find the odors so unpleasant and harsh that they often move away from areas that reek of camphor or menthol.  A simple tactic to use against ladybugs is to fill a fishbowl or other glass bowl with soapy water. The reflecting light will attract the ladybugs, who will then fall in and suffocate in the soapy film.   Ladybugs are attracted to light. Placing a clear, glass bowl filled with soapy water by a window or lamp can cause the light to reflect, making the bowl seem very appealing to ladybugs. As they try to come closer to look, they will fall in. A drop or two of liquid dish soap is all you need. This cuts down the water tension, thereby preventing the ladybugs from escaping and causing them to drown.  Boric acid, also known as borax, should be applied wherever you suspect a ladybug might travel.   The ladybugs must come into direct contact with the boric acid powder to be affected by it. When ladybugs get boric acid on themselves, they ultimately end up dehydrating to death.  The only recommended chemical action to take against ladybugs is the use of barrier pesticides. These chemicals should be sprayed around suspected entrances and paths. When the ladybugs cross the barrier, they get the pesticide on them, and eventually die.   Follow the instructions on the label to mix and apply the pesticide correctly. Never use an outdoor pesticide indoors or an indoor pesticide outdoors. Usually, the chemical is sprayed along a surface and adheres to it thanks to a carrier substrate in the insecticide. As a result, the poison stays on the surface, waiting for the ladybug to cross over it.    Most indoor bug bombs tend to be ineffective when ladybugs are concerned. Additionally, bug bombs can leave stains and residues on walls, counters, and other surfaces. These stains can be difficult to remove.  If all else fails, a professional exterminator should be able to come up with a solution to manage your ladybug problem. Make sure to call a pest control operator who has worked with ladybug infestations in the past, though.   A professional will evaluate the problem carefully to determine the best method of approach. He or she will usually apply a fast-acting residual insecticide more potent than those available commercially. The chemicals commonly used by professionals include lambda cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, bifenthrin, and cyfluthrin., Patch screen doors and window screens with additional screening wherever you see holes.   If your screens are covered in holes, you may find it simpler, quicker, and ultimately cheaper to simply buy a new screen to replace the old one.  One of the easiest ways to seal off a gap at the bottom of a door is to apply weather stripping there.   As an added bonus, you will likely save money on your electricity bill since less heat will escape your home and you will need less heat overall to warm things up.  When the weather starts to get colder and the ladybugs are more likely to creep inside for warmth, temporarily block your roof vents with fine wire mesh to cut off a likely path.  Any other hole or gap that leads from the exterior of your house to the interior needs to be mended so that ladybugs are cut off from your house altogether.   Use high quality silicone or silicone-latex caulk for the best results.Make sure to get all cracks around all your windows, door, siding, utility pips, chimneys, and wood fascia. Typically speaking, caulk is best for openings around windows and doors, while mortar might be better for cracks or holes in the outer wall. You may need cement for notably large holes. This step, too, can help you save money on your electricity bill.  While there is little scientific evidence to support the claim, popular lore dictates that light colors and contrasting colors are more appealing to ladybugs. Painting or siding your house with dark colors could, theoretically, cause fewer ladybugs to come visit.This up for debate, so you should not put too much effort, time, or money into this one unless you plan on changing the color of your house already for other, unrelated reasons.	Trap ladybugs in a vacuum cleaner. Avoid picking them up individually and by hand. Sweep ladybugs out the door. Capture ladybugs in a light trap. Spread out food grade Diatomaceous Earth (DE). Spray camphor and menthol around infested areas. Make a trap with soap and water. Sprinkle boric acid around infested areas. Try long-lasting pyrethrin or pyrethroid pesticides as a barrier. Avoid âbug bombs.â These wide-range insecticides are usually overkill and have undesirable consequences that you may find worse than the ladybugs themselves. Call a licensed pest control operator for professional help. Fix any holes in your windows and doors. Apply weather stripping. Temporarily block off your vents. Caulk gaps in your siding, piping, door frames, and window frames. Consider exterior building color as a last resort. Enjoy your ladybug-free home!
Each company has different rules and policies in place for business trips. Some companies may allow you to use a corporate credit card for your expenses or require you to pay for expenses up front with company reimbursements paid back to you after the trip. Don't book anything before you're certain, and don't be shy about asking: you'll only look conscientious if you ask about your financial obligations.   If you haven't been instructed already, make sure to ask your supervisor or other business travel representative, "Am I responsible for booking airfare and other travel arrangements? If so, am I reimbursed, and does reimbursement happen through a check or debit payment?" Ask if you're allowed a per diem, or by the day, rate for food. Ask if specific meals are covered or if any food allowance limits apply. Ask if gas is covered if you have a rental car. Ask if public transit or train tickets are applicable expenses. Keep track of all receipts and as out specific company details on how to report them. For example, ask if you should make copies of receipts or submit originals in an expense report. It is important to be familiar with your company's travelling policies, as your actions on the business trip will reflect on you and your ability to follow company policy.; , Keep all of your required documents in one place, such as passports or visas. Include hotel and car reservations with your travel documents to stay organized. Make sure your passport or visa doesnât expire within six months of your trip.Find out if your home country has an embassy or consulate in your destination country in case of emergencies or dangerous situations.Check with your company or check your destination countryâs government website for border control to find out if you need mandatory vaccinations. If you donât have a passport, make sure to apply for one at least two or three months ahead of time, or follow your home countryâs procedures to get an expedited passport.  If you responsible for booking and reserving your travel accommodations, make sure you do so in advance. Reserve a hotel room, rental car, train tickets, or airline tickets, depending on your needs.Make sure to shop around for deals and compare prices, unless your company has designated airline or hotel partnerships. If you are travelling to another country, double check to see if any major holidays fall during your trip. Make sure businesses are still open for the accommodations you need on those holidays. Call your travel providers and hotel to confirm your accommodations within one to days before your trip. Donât just assume everything is going according to plan.	Review your company's reimbursement and travel and expense policies. Prepare travel documents for international travel. Book reservations and other arrangements.
In checkers, the person who has more kings also has the advantage. Try to crown as many pieces as possible to increase your chances of winning the game.To put this advice into practice, advance a piece toward an area on your board where your opponent has fewer pieces, or pieces that are more spread out. If you can protect this piece with nearby pieces and sacrifices, then you have a good chance at making a king. See Intermediate Strategies below for how to "redirect the enemy" and sneak through a king.; , It's impossible for your opponent to crown his or her pieces if your back row is occupied, so this strategy will prevent your opponent from getting the advantage too soon in the game. You will also have more movement options left when you do start moving your back row pieces.Remember that you won't be able to keep your back row intact forever. Once you're low on pieces or you see an opportunity for an advantageous trade, don't hesitate to move out.  Two pieces "in tandem" are adjacent to each other on a diagonal line. Keeping pieces near enough to form tandem in one move makes it much harder for your opponent to capture them."Following" a piece you moved earlier before you move it again will leave your front piece less open to capture. Following it with two pieces is even safer, since you can block capture from two directions. See Intermediate Strategies to learn how to form "trapping pairs".  It's obvious that trading one of your checkers for two of your opponent's checkers benefits you, but even trading one for one is useful if you had more checkers to begin with.For example, if you have 5 checkers and your opponent has 4 checkers, then the board is almost equal. But once you trade three pieces each, you have a huge advantage with twice as many pieces as your opponent (2 to 1)!  , If you keep a few pieces near the center, you will keep your options open and be able to move rapidly to whichever side of the board needs your attention. Likewise, preventing your opponent from placing pieces in the center will deny him or her this advantage.It takes practice to judge how many pieces you need to commit to the center in a particular game. As a general rule, you should try to build up enough of a position that the opponent is unable to safely advance anywhere except the left and right edges. After that goal is achieved, adding more of your pieces can actually clog up your board and lower your options., The "forced capture" rule requires a player to make a capture if they are able to. Think ahead to what the board will look like if you force your opponent to capture your piece and you might discover it's worth the sacrifice.   If you're trying to crown a piece but your opponent is pursuing it, you can sacrifice a less important piece to lure the pursuer away from your soon-to-be king.If you have a diagonal line of pieces, moving the forward one toward the enemy can force a capture that places the enemy piece next to another of yours. Make sure you don't open yourself up to a double capture!, To use the "Trapping Pairs" strategy, you need to wait for a certain setup on the board. Your first checker (piece 1) should be in the leftmost or rightmost column, against the edge of the board. Your second checker (piece 2) should be one row in front of your first checker on the diagonal. Following that same diagonal, there should be an empty space, then one of your opponent's checkers(piece A), then another opponent checker (piece B) one row behind.Move piece 2 toward your opponent's pieces, so that it is in danger of being captured. The forced capture rule requires your opponent's piece A to jump piece 2, but it cannot then jump piece 1 because it is against the edge of the board. After your opponent has captured your piece 2, the you can use your piece 1 to jump piece A. In the basic scenario described, this is an unexciting 1-for-1 trade. However, after setting up your trapping pair, you can often wait to "trigger" it until the opportunity for a double capture arises.  To use "Redirect Your Enemy," you will need to designate 6 pieces on one side of your board as group A and the other 6 on the other side as group B. You will use these designations to determine what pieces you move at different times in the game.Move the pieces in A group almost exclusively at the start of the game, only occasionally moving a B piece when there is no good A move. When you begin trading pieces with your opponent, trade A pieces over B pieces whenever possible. Once a few capture exchanges have happened, your opponent will likely be concentrated on the side of the board with your A pieces. Begin advancing your B pieces in groups and you'll be in a strong position to crown past your opponent's depleted defenses.  Some tournaments are run using basic checkers rules, referred to as Go As You Please, GAYP, or freestyle. Others follow the 3-move rules, which limit players' options at the start of the game to a set of three move sequences. (The 3-move rules greatly reduce the possibility of a draw between skilled players.), More recent books will contain up-to-date strategic advances, but this is less important if you're a beginner. Browsing the checkers shelf at a library or bookstore can help you find a book that is helpful and fun to read., For 3-move play, find an encyclopedia of 3-move openers. For GAYP rules, select a preferred opener and practice games with every possible response from your opponent.Memorizing specific board states from the mid-game and endgame can be useful as well, but you're much less likely to encounter a specific midgame in a tournament than one of the standard openers.  Playing against more experienced players who are willing to share their knowledge is a great way to improve your game. Whether that means entering tournaments or finding your local amateur expert, the better your opponents are, the more you'll learn.	Focus on crowning more pieces than your opponent. Keep your back row in place until you need to move those checkers. Advance pieces in close groups and in tandem. Trade checkers when you're ahead. Control the center of the board. Sacrifice pieces to gain advantages. Try a "Trapping Pairs" strategy. Use the "Redirect Your Enemy" strategy. Decide which rules of checkers to follow. Study a checkers strategy guide that matches your rules system and skill level. Practice and memorize specific opening sequences. Play against the best opponents you can find.
