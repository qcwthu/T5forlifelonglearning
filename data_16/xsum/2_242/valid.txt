Researchers tested 15-year-old girls and boys from 26 countries in 2012. They wanted to find how gaming affected their learning, using computer and paper tests in maths, science and reading. The results found that those who played single-player games every now and then, did better than those who never, or hardly ever, played games. Single-player gamers did particularly well in computer tests to do with maths and problem solving. The researchers think this could be because they're more familiar with computer games, so they're more at ease with tests on computers. However, the researchers also found that those who played games every day or very regularly did worse on paper-based tests. They reckon too much gaming might crowd out other activities like doing homework and reading books. The report found those who played multi-player online games did a lot worse in both paper and computer tests. Those who played single-player games did much better. Online multi-player games are typically played late at night, and for long periods of time, which might make those who play them more tired and less able to concentrate. The research was published by the international organisation the OECD, which helps governments come up with plans for improving life in their countries.	A new international report suggests that gaming regularly can help you to do better in tests at school.
Hilary McClintock was elected as mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Monday. The SDLP's Jim McKeever is the new deputy mayor. In 2012, the DUP mayor of Londonderry Maurice Devenney refused to hand his chains to Sinn Féin's Kevin Campbell. Mayor McClintock said it was "significant" but things had moved on. "Its part of the process towards normality, the same thing happened in Belfast council a few days ago," she said. "It was something that we discussed locally and it wasn't really a big deal so we're quite happy to accept it (mayoral chains) from the outgoing mayor." The Drumahoe based councillor said that during her term she wants more investment because people in the north west feel like "second class citizens". "I don't want us to be second class I want us to punch a bit higher and I will hopefully lead on that," she said. "I don't think it's even a party thing. I think west of the Bann we sometimes do feel neglected. "There's a lot more that can be done for the city, in terms of unemployment we have absolutely woeful figures. "We do need to bring more jobs and more infrastructure," she added. Family, friends and councillors from different parties clapped and cheered as former mayor Elisha McCallion placed the mayoral chain around Mrs McClintock's neck. The former mayor told BBC Radio Foyle she was delighted to be able to do so. "I'm delighted everything went well for the new mayor and I want to wish her all the best for the future, and the deputy mayor as well," Mrs McCallion said. "Its a very symbolic day because that was actually the very first time a DUP mayor has accepted a chain from a Sinn Féin ex-mayor. "It just goes to show you where we are as a society here in this city so I was delighted to do that honour," she said. Mrs McClintock, who is married with two daughters, has previously worked as a civil servant and a classroom assistant.	For the first time in Londonderry an outgoing Sinn Féin mayor has placed the chains of office around the neck of a DUP successor.
It suggested 91% of people were satisfied with GP care and 92% with their last NHS hospital appointment. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it was "heartening" to see such high levels of satisfaction. The survey was an "important resource" which would help "support the delivery of public services", she added. Asked to rate services on a scale of zero to 10, the average rating for health services was 6.3 and education 6.6, with performance of the Welsh government just above the middle of the range at 5.6, all in line with previous years. On other aspects of life, there were large majorities satisfied with their accommodation (94%), recycling services (82%) and the level of respect in their local community (79%). Overall, the survey of more than 14,000 people found that 83% were satisfied with their daily lives. Other less positive findings included: There were mixed views on the performance of councils, which have been getting to grips with steep budget cuts. People agreeing that their local authority provides high quality services fell from 57%, in both of the two previous years, to 53%. This varied from 42% in Blaenau Gwent believing their local services were high quality to 65% in Conwy. Across Wales, just 37% agreed that their council "does all it can to improve my local area". Powys came off worst on this question, with just 29% agreeing with the statement, while Caerphilly got the best result, where 45% agreed. Welcoming the overall results, Ms Hutt said: "It is particularly heartening to see such high levels of satisfaction with the NHS and education. "The survey is an important resource for us and will support the delivery of public services. "Hearing the views of people across the country will help us make Wales an even better place to live, work and enjoy." No wonder the Welsh government sounds happy - after a year when their record on public services, health in particular, has been under scrutiny like never before, it seems the people who use those services have had a positive experience. The data confirms a paradox any politician who's knocked on a voter's door will recognise - people tend to think their own experience is good, but have a perception that the overall picture is poor. Not that anyone should run away with the idea that life in Wales is without its problems. Forty percent of people report finding it difficult to keep up with the bills, although that figure is lower than in previous years. And one in five say they feel "materially deprived" - going without a holiday, failing to put anything aside or feeling unable to have the heating on. It's not all good news for the Welsh government either - although the public has rated elements of the NHS and education highly, the administration that delivers them gets only a modest score: 5.6 out of 10.	People across Wales remain "highly satisfied" with the NHS, education and with their daily lives, according to a national survey.
Tear gas was used near the Idomeni crossing, where more than 11,000 refugees and other migrants are camped out on the Greek side of the border. Aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had treated around 300 injured people. Balkan states closed off the migrant route to northern Europe this year. "The indiscriminate use of chemicals, rubber bullets and stun grenades against vulnerable populations... is a dangerous and deplorable act," Greek government spokesman George Kyritsis said. MSF said authorities had fired tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades at those trying to force their way into Macedonia. "Two hundred people were treated for respiratory problems caused by tear gas, mostly men but including women and some children under the age of five," MSF spokesman Jonas Hagensen told the BBC. More than 30 people were treated for rubber bullet wounds, he added, and a further 10 people said they had been beaten by Macedonian police. Some 30 people had been treated for shock and other injuries; seven had been sent to hospital with more serious wounds. Sunday's unrest reportedly began after a group of migrants approached the fence to ask Macedonian border guards to open it and let them pass. When their demand was rejected, they were joined by others, some of whom were carrying packed bags. Migrants could be seen running from clouds of tear gas just inside the Greek border, as well as hurling stones across the fence. 152,461 in 2016, up to 7 April 37% of 2016 arrivals are children 53% arrive on Lesbos 366 died on Turkey-Greece route 853,650 arrivals in 2015 An unnamed Macedonian police official told AFP: "Greek police are using tear gas near the border with Macedonia. It is calm so far on the Macedonian side of the border." However, Reuters news agency, also quoting an unnamed Macedonian police official, said migrants had thrown stones at the Macedonian police. "The police fired tear gas in response," the official said. "The migrants were pushing against the fence but standing on the Greek side of the border. The fence is still there, they have not broken through." This week Greece began deporting migrants who do not qualify for asylum, under an EU deal with Turkey. More than 300 people, many of them Pakistanis, were sent to Turkey by ferry from the Greek islands. In addition, nearly 100 were deported via Greece's land border with Turkey, AFP reports. The International Organisation for Migration said the rate of arrivals had dropped in the first week of April, with 5 April the first day since last year that no arrivals were recorded. More than a million undocumented refugees and other migrants have entered the EU by boat from Turkey to Greece since early last year, generating an unprecedented crisis for the EU's 28 member-states. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.	Greece has condemned the action of Macedonian police to disperse hundreds of migrants at the border between the two countries.
Abbey Road is full of gremlins. Giles Martin - son of record producer George Martin - can't play any music through his mixing desk at the iconic North London studios. He re-boots his computer while two engineers crawl on the floor, plugging in cables and fiddling with various switches. At one point, someone unplugs a hard drive. "Oh God, you've just deleted the Beatles," Martin deadpans. Eventually, the equipment springs to life. The producer dismisses a workman, who has appeared to drill locks into the door, and apologises for the delay. "I just moved into this studio yesterday," he explains. With that, Martin loads up a file that contains dozens of versions of the Beatles' back catalogue. There are the original recordings, mono mixes, stereo remasters and various other snippets - all of which Martin can flick between at will. He used these tracks as a reference while producing a new DVD compilation, Beatles 1+, which sees the Fab Four's biggest hits re-imagined in stereo and 5.1 surround sound, accompanied by restored promotional videos and films. "The goal is to bring the band closer to you," says Martin. "To have that same feeling at home that I get when I put on the tapes in the studio." Rather than viewing the originals as sacred, the band appreciate their music being tweaked this way, he says. "My dad went to see John Lennon in 1980 before he died, and John said to him: 'Do you know what I'd really like to do? I'd love to record everything again.' "Dad said, 'Really? How about Strawberry Fields?' "And John said: 'Especially Strawberry Fields.'" Counter-intuitively, Martin's new mixes are often simpler than the existing stereo versions - but he has a solid explanation. Up to Yellow Submarine, the Beatles treated the mono mixes of their albums as the definitive documents. The stereo versions were created as an afterthought, often without the band's involvement. "My dad was never happy with the extreme panning that went on," explains the producer. "You'd have the band on one side and all the vocals on the other. "And you have what I call the socks and sandals brigade saying: 'The only way to listen to Sgt Pepper's is in mono.' To be honest, they're probably right, but no-one does that any more." So he set about recapturing the power of those mono recordings. "In Beatles world, if you can make something more aggressive, they want it more aggressive," Martin says, cueing up Paperback Writer to prove his point. "If you listen, this mono mix is very crunchy, very in your face," he says, as the textured harmonies give way to Paul McCartney's guitar riff. "The stereo sounds wider," Martin continues, switching seamlessly to that version, "but the problem is that all the action - the guitar and drums - are on the left speaker." "The guitar riff is what you remember about that song," he says, but it loses its oomph by being shifted to one side. Accordingly, the new mix puts the instruments into a focussed central point, while spreading the vocals across the front speakers. The rear speakers present a separate challenge. Rather than placing Ringo's drums behind the listener, or making vocals circle the room, Martin opts for restraint. "Dolby came to see me with 5.1 when it was new," he explains, "and they'd mixed What's Going On by Marvin Gaye in surround sound, with the guitar coming out of the right rear speaker. "But if you went to see Marvin Gaye performing and his guitar player decided to stand at the back of the audience with his amp, you'd go: 'Could you put him on the stage, please?'" Over-using those rear channels is "really distracting," Martin argues, so he came up with an ingenious solution. He went into Abbey Road's Studio 2, wired up a "really big" loudspeaker and played the original Beatles recordings at full volume. "We acted like the band were playing in there again, and recorded the walls using the original Beatles microphones," he says. Those reverberations and echoes were then placed into the rear speakers to give "the illusion of being in the room with the band". "And they are really good as a band," Martin says. "That sounds stupid, but they do actually make a good sound. You want to get the least stuff between that and what's at home." With the later Beatles recordings, however, he had more opportunity to be playful. "Strawberry Fields is more of a sound picture than a song," Martin says, scrolling over to John Lennon's masterpiece, and locating the descending svarmandal figure (the one that sounds like a sitar) between the first chorus and second verse. "On the stereo remaster, the svarmandal does something cool - it pans. So in our new version, we can steal that and make it even better. Now it goes around all five speakers like a horseshoe." But Martin also made a more elemental tweak. "The mono Strawberry Fields - the one the Beatles mixed - is slightly more intense and more condensed. There's a mellotron pulse under John's voice which forms a sort of harmonic for his vocal. In the stereo it's off to one side and, as a result, John's voice sounds thinner. "I said: 'OK, if we're doing a new mix of this, we should do one that sounds like the mono. So we came up with this," he says, pressing play on the updated version which, it has to be said, sounds much more fulsome. In making such decisions, Martin tried to put himself into the mindset of John, Paul, Ringo and the two Georges as they worked - just metres away from where he's sitting - in the 1960s. "All of the songs should sound like you remember them," he says. "It's not meant to be the 'Giles Martin version'. I work for the Beatles." Martin confesses to one glaring mistake: The stereo mix of Lennon and McCartney's kitchen sink symphony A Day In The Life is missing a piano, because he opted to use the version created for the Cirque Du Soleil show, Love. "All of these fans will be going: 'Why did you take this piano off?' And the answer is I didn't - I just used the Love version," he cringes. Martin is modest about his achievements, saying more than once that "there's no talent in what I do". And he admits his every decision will be pored over by Beatles obsessives. "There are people who know this material better than I do," he says. "But generally I get a pretty good ride. They know I do it because I care, rather than showboating and going: 'This is how I think they should sound.'" Ultimately, he would have liked to be more inventive with the surround mixes but had to "rein myself in, because these are the Beatles number one hits". "If I was doing a 5.1 of the White Album, though? Let me at it!" The Beatles 1+ is out now.	Giles Martin reveals how he took The Beatles master tapes and remixed them in surround sound for the Fab Four's new video collection.
An exhibition in London explores the global refugee crisis through the eyes of eight photographers reporting from 13 countries on behalf of Oxfam. The pictures aim to capture something of the personal stories behind the migration facts and figures. Photography director Rebecca McClelland said: "My aim was to be as sensitive as possible to the subject, whilst stretching the limited language of crisis photography." The Stand as One exhibition can be seen at 4 Holywell Lane, London from 8-15 September 2016.	All photographs courtesy Oxfam
However, it might do well to look to Iceland, which has come up with a radical plan to get rid of its pay gap completely. A bill was tabled in the country's parliament that would require firms to prove they offer equal pay to employees, or potentially face fines. It comes as less stringent British laws on gender pay come into effect. These will require firms to publish data on their gender pay gap, but not penalise offenders. So should the UK go further and outlaw the gender pay gap? Iceland ranks first on the World Economic Forum's 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, but the nation of 323,000 people still has a difference of 7% between the sexes. However, the new bill would require companies with 25 or more employees to go through audits and gain certification of their equal-pay programmes. Thorsteinn Viglundsson, social affairs and equality minister, accepted the law could be "burdensome" for the country's businesses, but said the benefits would outweigh the costs. And with cross party support, the bill could well become law by next January. According to Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equal pay, similar measures must be considered in the UK. At 9.4% in 2016, the difference between average pay for male and female full-time employees in Britain was little changed from the 10.5% gap five years earlier. And a Deloitte report last year found the gender pay gap in the UK will not close until 2069 based on current salary progression. "It's impressive to see what is being introduced in Iceland and full equal pay audits would be good to see. But we are some way off that here," Mr Smethers said. Certainly, the government is making moves to tackle the issue. From Thursday, UK employers with more than 250 staff will be required by law to collect data so they can publish their gender pay gap, gender bonus gap and the number of women and men who get a bonus. But employer groups said said introducing audits and certification, as Iceland may do, would not solve the gender pay gap. Neil Carberry, director for people and skills policy at the CBI, said: "The gender pay gap and unequal pay are different. While many factors contribute to the UK's gender pay gap, unequal pay is already illegal and is only a part of the gap." He added: "To close the gender pay gap in the UK, businesses and the government need to work together to address careers advice, progression and support networks, like childcare. These are not things that an employer certification regime would address." Verity O'Keefe, senior employment and skills policy adviser at EEF, which represents manufacturers, said flaws in the UK's new rules also needed to be addressed. "The transparency [the new data collected] will drive is important, but it must also be recognised that the simple snapshot it will provide may often hide a more complex picture," she said. "Manufacturers are likely to unearth some higher than average figures. However, this is not due to a lack of support for women in our sector, far from it." More needed to be done to get young girls into "all important" science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects, Ms O'Keefe added.	Like many countries, the UK has made slow progress in reducing its gender pay gap.
There were also golds for James Crisp, who won his fifth European title in the S9 100m backstroke, while Ollie Hynd led home a GB one-two in the S8 400m freestyle with Josef Craig taking silver. Hannah Russell (S12 50m freestyle) and Stephanie Millward (S9 100m backstroke) added silvers to the GB medal haul. Rodgers beat her previous best of 36.01 seconds, set in 2012, with an impressive 35.90 to triumph by 2.82secs and take her third consecutive title. The 32-year-old, who missed out on a medal in the event at London 2012, is benefiting from a new butterfly technique where she uses just one arm and although most of her main rivals are from outside Europe, she was pleased with her time. "I've been working quite hard on that one," she said. "Last week was a bit of a mixed bag for me at trials so it's really nice to come out and get a good time. "It's great to see the hard work paying off. If PBs and records happen all the time then you take it for granted but it's such an amazing feeling." Sheffield's Crisp, 33, who won his first European title back in 1999, used all his experience over the second 50m to finish 0.8secs ahead of Poland's Patryk Biskup with team-mate Lewis White finishing fourth at his first major championships. "I kind of see the last 19 years as a bit of a warm-up to this year," he said. "This is the year that counts and it's good to know I am there or thereabouts and fighting for the medals still. "I have to change my training a little bit now I am in my thirties but I feel strong and fit." S8 400m silver medallist Craig was competing just a day after being disqualified from the S8 100m freestyle final because his tattoo breached advertising regulations. He returned to the pool on Monday with the design covered up.	Susie Rodgers improved her own S7 50m butterfly European record to win one of three golds for Great Britain on day two of the IPC Swimming Open European Championships in Madeira.
The Bluebirds could receive up to £5m for the Scotland goalkeeper. But Giles says the 31-year-old is worth at least £8m, underlining Cardiff's malaise in the Championship. "They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere," said Giles. Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading. The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009. Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats. Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving. "I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club," said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised. "Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go. "Probably if Hull win the Premier League they'll get £5m." "They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere." Giles agrees that Cardiff City need a proven goalscorer, but does not believe one will be signed. "Without a doubt Cardiff need a striker and talking to fans, they're looking for someone to score 15-20 goals a season," he told Radio Wales Sport. "Well that's not going to happen this year and unfortunately we're looking at a season where if they finish half way, they've done well. "Is that going to bring your fans back? You'll always get your diehards going, but is that going to get enthusiastic people coming down to Cardiff City Stadium? "It's a poor Cardiff City when they're watching second-rate football."	The sale by Cardiff City of captain David Marshall to Hull City has been described as "a joke" by former midfielder David Giles.
The company, founded by billionaire Newcastle United boss Mike Ashley, has seen its shares rise 86% since the start of the year. The FTSE 100 is updated every three months, reflecting changes in the market value of companies. The reshuffle takes effect from 23 September. Greek coke bottler Coca Cola Hellenic is also set to join the top flight of London-listed companies after it switched its primary listing from Athens to London earlier this year. But outsourcing firm Serco has been dropped after its shares fell 8.5% since the end of June. It is facing an investigation into its practices, and the potential suspension of future government contracts, saw its share price plunge earlier in the summer, before recovering slightly. Sports Direct, said in a trading update on Wednesday that sales had risen by 18.2% in the 13 weeks to the end of July, compared to the same period last year.	Retailer Sports Direct will enter the FTSE 100 as part of the latest reshuffle of the 100 biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange.
The Metropolitan Police said Daniel Sheehan, of no fixed address, had been charged on Saturday. He will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. No members of the Royal Family are thought to have been at the palace at the time of the alleged incident on Friday. The Queen had undertaken an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle earlier in the day.	A 21-year-old man has been charged with two counts of trespass after climbing a gate at Buckingham Palace, police say.
The North Wales Health Alliance (NWHA) said a Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board report highlighted serious issues around patient safety. The pressure group said it meant, in some cases, the board risked breaking the law. The board said it was already working on measures to reduce risks. The findings of the annual safeguarding report were presented to officials at the health board last week. It outlined 13 'red' areas of risk, including: The concerns by the NWHA come as the board meets on Thursday to get the latest update on two inquiries into events at Glan Clwyd Hospital's Tawel Fan ward, which closed in 2013. "A year and a half after going into special measures and receiving additional support, we have to ask whether Betsi Cadwaladr is learning lessons and making improvements?" stated Marc Jones, from the NWHA. "These are not trivial issues but are serious risks. The scandal surrounding Tawel Fan should have been a wake-up call regarding the need to take at-risk patients' safety and well-being seriously. "We do not want to see a repeat of that." The health board's own analysis of its safeguarding weaknesses highlighted "unclear" policies, little evidence of sharing good practice, and relatively low uptake on safeguarding training. In an independent investigation in May 2015, relatives said patients on the Tawel Fan ward were treated like animals in a zoo. It led to the health board being put into special measures by the Welsh Government, and its former chief executive stepped down. Betsi Cadwaladr board members will be told later that the current inquires into what happened are expected to continue until the summer. Responding to the NWHA criticism, Dr Evan Moore, the board's executive medical director, said "positive action" was already under way and have continued since the safeguarding assessment was made in autumn 2016. "The committee recognised that these had lowered our exposure to the risks in many areas and as a result agreed that the associated risk scores would be reduced. "The board will consider a detailed report on this in public at its full meeting in March."	Campaigners have accused a health board of risking patient safety and failing to learn lessons from a mental health ward scandal.
The Super Eagles have made an impressive start to their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. But it has become apparent that the German coach faces a major headache at right fullback. Nigeria has struggled to find a competent rightback since the departure of Chidi Odiah in 2010. Rohr has tried four different players in three matches as he seeks to keep the West Africans at the top of Group B. The Super Eagles boss said: "We have been trying to find the right balance but the struggle in the rightback position is something we hope to sort out. "Musa Muhammed played in that position against Tanzania and he was good, but he's not playing at his club in Turkey İstanbul Başakşehir. "We have also played [Wilfred] Ndidi, [Kenneth] Omeruo and Shehu [Abdullahi] but there is no permanent man. "This is something we have to fix." Yisa Sofoluwe and Austin Eguavoen are both famous for providing strong cover in the rightback spot in the 1980s and 1990s before Nduka Ugbade, Mobi Oparaku, Joseph Yobo and Chidi Odiah stepped in. Nigeria have since tried Efe Ambrose, Chibuzor Okonkwo, Ogenyi Onazi, Kenneth Omeruo, Leon Balogun, Musa Muhammed and Sheu Abdullahi without much success. Dutch-born defender Tyronne Ebuehi, 20, was seen as the man to plug the hole but the youngster rejected the chance to play against Algeria in a World Cup qualifier earlier this month, saying he prefers to focus on establishing himself at his Dutch club ADO Den Haag instead. Nigeria's 3-1 over the Desert Foxes on 12 November coupled with an away victory in Zambia last month propelled them to the top of Group B. The three-time African champions host Cameroon in back-to-back fixtures on 28 August 2017 and 2 September 2017.	Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr has admitted that a problem at rightback could derail the Super Eagles' quest for a place at the 2018 World Cup finals.
A surge in the Â£60 charges followed a change in government guidelines which said such absences were only permitted in "exceptional circumstances". But the policy was thrown into confusion in May when the High Court ruled a single holiday did not break rules on regular attendance. Now Derbyshire County Council has said only extreme cases will be fined. In the 2014/2015 school year, Derbyshire County Council handed out nearly 3,200 of the Â£60 per child, per week fines -  the fifth highest number in the country. The High Court ruling, which is the subject of an appeal, left education authorities having to decide how to apply the existing rules and subsequently a number of court cases were abandoned. Derbyshire County Council has confirmed its "interim arrangements", which state if attendance is above 94% - equivalent to missing 11 or 12 days - over the previous 12 months, only a warning letter will be issued. Katherine Boulton, the council's service director for schools and learning, said: "We strongly recommend that pupils should not be taken out of school during term time. "But there are always exceptional circumstances and the council believes these measures are fair and proportionate." Craig Langman, of campaign group Parents Want A Say, said: "This is great news. We have heard of some parents who were facing action, checking on the progress of cases against them, only to be told their child's attendance now comes within acceptable limits. "But this is the first instance I know of where a education authority has clearly stated new guidelines. It's a great step and we encourage others to follow suit."	Fines for taking children on holiday in school term time are being largely abandoned by a local authority.
There was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going. Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession. But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications. First off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as "early as possible", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit. Yes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record. Voters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of £2 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands. There is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again.  But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years. And with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint. Despite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference. Privately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with. And Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush. Indeed, the charts that estimate who is bearing the brunt of the government's policies suggest that when everything is taken into consideration, not just today's measures, the three poorest groups are all slightly worse off. The only group that loses more is the top 10%. Beyond all the charts and tables and documents, though, Mr Hammond dropped one giant hint which is perhaps politically one of the most important things of the day. He was talking about the "triple lock", the guaranteed increases in the state pension, seen by many in Westminster privately to be completely unaffordable in the longer term, but few will yet say it in public. He said: "And we will meet our pledge to our country's pensioners through the triple lock. But as we look ahead to the next Parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability. "And so the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next Parliament in light of the evolving fiscal position at the next Spending Review." That sounds pretty bland, but the implications are anything but. It holds out the possibility that the Tories could look at ditching those guarantees and "other commitments", perhaps the ring fence of the NHS Budget, when they look at what the country can afford after 2020. It was only a hint, but in time it may become a very important one. Mr Hammond rarely says anything by mistake. But, without fighting that political battle, there was plenty that was bruising enough from today's announcements, plenty to make the government's life harder, and indeed, potentially those of plenty of voters too. PS As ever, the documents published alongside the statement bear close examination. In the coming days more important nuggets may emerge. But a few quick ones that caught our eye -  the administration of Brexit is expected to cost the taxpayer £412m. The government has set aside £60m a year for grammar schools to expand.	Ouch!
This is an attempt to set up what will be called the TFTA (Tripartite Free Trade Area). It will be signed between the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the South African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC). Now there's been great fanfare in the press about this, mainly pushed by the politicians who are made to look good by this kind of thing. But the headlines of "Common Market for Africa" or "EU-style bloc emerges in Africa" are misleading. If the TFTA functions properly, it will be a free trade area, not a common market and certainly nothing approaching what the EU is. The trouble is not all the players involved function properly themselves. COMESA still has certain tariffs within it, while inside the EAC (arguably the most integrated of the blocs) there are still issues between Kenya and Tanzania on things like share ownership. And South Africa tends to dominate SADC. But that's not to say that this tripartite agreement is a waste of time. Free trade from Cape to Cairo has been a goal since colonial times (Cecil Rhodes talked about it) and this agreement is a baby step towards that. In theory, it'll boost intra-African trade, but that depends more on the capacity of African countries to make what each other want at competitive prices, rather than a simple lowering or scrapping of tariffs between the 26 members. The devil will be in the details of this agreement. There have been concerns over protectionist measures for local industries and a method of settling trade disputes. But it may boost intra-Africa trade. At the moment, trade between African countries amounts to just 13% of total African trade. Some academics have said that this tripartite agreement could boost it by 30% over the next few years. But there will be challenges on the ground. For a start, customs officials and getting across borders is notoriously cumbersome in Africa. Also, manufacturing on a local level needs to be boosted. The UN said three years ago that the best way to boost African trade was to concentrate on developing local capacity, rather than just lowering tariffs. That way, Africans would have things to sell to each other at prices that are more competitive than outsiders. If that happens within a new free trade area, that's what would boost intra-African trade. Also there are various disputes between the members of this agreement, from gripes to outright hostility. So, while there's a good deal of political will behind the TFTA, how it works on the ground will be the proof of the pudding. And that won't be apparent for months or years to come. Pardon my cynicism, but the three blocs involved in this are by no means functioning perfectly. With all the hype surrounding this TFTA, you'd think it was the panacea to all of Africa's economic and trade problems. It's not. But it is a tiny step in the right direction.	Some of you will have seen the news that a three-bloc trade deal is being signed between 26 African states in Egypt today.
