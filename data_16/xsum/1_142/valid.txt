The New Zealand spinner fell two runs short of a century when he was stumped off Jack Leach, who also finished with career-best figures of 7-106. After bowling Warwickshire out for 324, Somerset then slumped to 9-3 as Keith Barker picked up three early wickets. Patel's devastating spell saw the hosts bowled out for 110 at Taunton before Warwickshire closed on 20-0. The 35-year-old's fine innings, which included eight fours and four sixes, took the visitors past an unlikely 300 after they were 120-7 at one stage on day two. After resuming on 180-7, the Bears' recovery was aided by Laurie Evans who made 73, sharing an eighth-wicket stand of 166 with Patel. On a third day pitch which had begun to turn, Patel had Jim Allenby caught at short leg, before Peter Trego and Luke Ronchi were both dismissed lbw. Lewis Gregory then could only pick out deep mid-wicket when he looked to launch the spinner over the boundary rope. Having edged his way to 26 Tom Cooper was bowled to give Patel his third first-class five-wicket haul of the season. Jamie Overton and Leach were both caught in the slips as Somerset were bowled out in just 34 overs, leaving Alfonso Thomas, in his final innings for the county, stranded on 13. Varun Chopra and Ian Westwood saw off the final hour before stumps without trouble to leave the Bears requiring another 205 for victory. Bears all-rounder Jeetan Patel told BBC WM: "It didn't bother me falling two short of a century because I don't really worry about stats like that. The partnership with Laurie Evans was more important because it got us back in the game. "The main thing is that it was a good day for the team. After seeing Jack Leach do so well for Somerset it was good for me to get some turn and take wickets. The ball is coming out well for me at the moment. "We still have a lot of work to do to win the game because 200 more will take some getting on that pitch. Hopefully we can be proactive from the start tomorrow and finish the season with a win." Somerset fast bowler Alfonso Thomas: "It was emotional for me walking out to bat in both innings on my last appearance for the club because I have had eight great years here. "There have been a lot of highlights. Taking four wickets in four balls in a Championship match was great for me personally, but there have been so many memorable times for the team while I have been here and a lot of great one-day occasions at Taunton. "I still think we can win this game. The pitch is aiding spin, rather than seam, but hopefully I can chip in and we can support Jack Leach. If that happens, it won't be easy for Warwickshire to get 200 more runs."	Jeetan Patel took a career-best 7-38 after hitting 98 as Warwickshire fought back against Somerset.
Local media said the T-Team captain, who was 30, collapsed three minutes into the match in Kota Bharu and was taken to hospital. The match was abandoned after 60 minutes when a message was received from the hospital that Oniya had died. Oniya had only just joined the Malaysian club this season.	Nigerian defender David Faramola Oniya died on Saturday after collapsing on the pitch during a friendly between his Malaysian club T-Team and Kelantan.
The non-denominational school with community sports facilities is to be built on the site of the former North Kelvinside Secondary School at the top of Queen Margaret Drive. Last year, Glasgow City Glasgow held a consultation and now the proposal has been agreed by councillors. Changes to the surrounding schools' catchment areas were also approved. Primary schools included in the changes are Cadder, Caldercuilt, Kelvindale, Parkview, Highpark, Dunard, Saracen, Oakgrove and Royston. The council's children and young people spokeswoman Liz Cameron said the school would be a great asset to the local community. "It's wonderful to be witnessing the resurgence and regeneration of Maryhill and as a result the need for additional primary school places," she said.	A new primary school is to be built in the Maryhill area of Glasgow to meet a projected rise in the school roll.
The NASUWT survey claims some parents are asked for £400 or more per year. Schools in England have been warning of cash shortages and the union says schools are now depending on parents. But the Department for Education says "no parent is required to make a contribution". Teachers' unions are holding their conferences over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with funding one of the biggest issues. The National Union of Teachers, meeting in Cardiff, will hear warnings on Saturday about the impact of cash shortages. The survey from the NASUWT survey, holding its annual conference in Manchester, claims that schools are increasingly relying on money from parents. Based on almost 4,000 responses, the survey says 18% of parents have been asked to sign up for direct debits or standing orders for their children's school, typically of about £50 per year. But more than one in 20 parents with children in state schools were paying £400 or above. A further 13% of parents had been asked to make donations in cash or cheques. Your comments on schools asking parents to top up their budgets: "She's only been there a term, but there seems to be a letter home at least once a week asking for money," a parent told the NASUWT survey. "The school asks for a 'voluntary contribution' but if you forget to pay you are sent texts telling you that you haven't paid," said another parent. There were other financial costs for parents, such as a laptop for homework and music lessons. "We have not allowed them to do music at school as they need to provide their own instruments," said a parent, quoted in the survey. Over a quarter of parents said their child had been unable to take part in a trip or excursion because of the cost. "Ski trip was £600. French trip £450. These are for less than a week. They are beyond my funds," a parent told the survey. The union's leader Chris Keates said that "access to education must not be based on parents' ability to pay". This week the Sutton Trust education charity warned of schools cutting staff because of financial pressure. The Public Accounts Committee has said that standards are threatened by school budget cuts of £3bn. A lobby of Parliament over funding, by teachers' unions and parents' campaign groups, has been announced for early June. Kevin Courtney, NUT general secretary, reminded the government of a manifesto commitment to parents that "the money that follows their children into schools will be protected". "In half of the schools in the country the money following your child into schools has been dramatically cut in cash terms, and in the other half it's been cut in real terms," he said. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "No parent is required to make a contribution to their child's education, the rules are clear on this and no policies have been introduced by this government to allow schools to charge parents." The spokeswoman said school funding was at record levels, but "we recognise schools are facing cost pressures."	Almost one in five parents in the UK is being asked to set up payments to their children's schools, as head teachers warn of budget shortages, says a survey from a teachers' union.
For many pundits the move comes as a surprise, because M-Pesa has been a huge success in other African states - especially in Kenya where it was launched in 2007. The service allows people without bank accounts to transfer money quickly, easily and safely using their mobile phones. According to a World Bank report, only 12% of Africans with bank accounts use mobile money services. However, this is not the case in South Africa. Mobile phone usage is high - nine in 10 South Africans own a mobile phone - and a third of these are smartphones, according to figures from the Pew Research Center. Yet South Africa has the most technologically advanced, financially liquid and accessible banking system on the continent. About 75% of adults in the country have bank accounts, a survey done by technology research body FinMark shows. In a statement, Vodacom Chief Executive Shameel Joosub said the success of M-Pesa in South Africa hinged on "achieving a critical mass of users". But Vodacom has struggled to find the customers. That is the problem. M-Pesa was launched in South Africa in 2010, perhaps with the hope of capturing the energy and excitement of a nation hosting the football World Cup. Trading on its position as the leading mobile operator in the country, Vodacom thought it could build an M-Pesa customer base of 10 million in three years. However, six years on the service only has 76,000 active users in South Africa, although many more have been registered. M-Pesa: The mobile wallet Source: Vodacom Jambo pesa! (Hello, money! in Swahili) A few reasons have been cited for its failure. Vodacom had to partner with a bank to provide the financial service on its platform. Nedbank was its choice - and although it is one of the largest banks in South Africa, the perception is that it caters for middle-class and high-income earners. These customers already have an array of banking services and platforms through which to conduct their business. South Africa is also a country where banks have actually made significant inroads in both urban and rural areas. Though untested, it is said that there is a bank, branch or ATM within a 20km (12-mile) radius in any urban or rural settlement. So the challenge in South Africa is not about access. Rather it is the ability to use various technologies to support how people save, spend and invest their money. In this regard, banks in the country are focused on developing new financial products that will enhance savings schemes and pension funds. Mobile phone operators, on the other hand, are working towards opening more secure platforms - for instance linking banks, hospitals, retailers, insurers, municipalities and revenue services. There is definitely still a case to be made for getting the unbanked population to open up accounts. And statistics show this is the trend. A 2015 KPMG report revealed that South African banks are growing at an annual rate of 7% and to date the industry has assets worth $361bn (Â£250bn). The prospects for financial services are good. Vodacom remains upbeat about the market in South Africa despite the failure of M-Pesa. "We remain of the opinion that opportunities exist in the financial services environment and we will continue to explore these," Mr Joosub said But the only real concern is the continued growth and stability of the South African economy. The country has been facing severe economic storms caused by slow growth, a weakened currency, disinvestment in mining, factories closing down and unemployment on the rise. These problems need to be tackled head-on, if communications, banking and services are to continue to thrive and create a new direction for this economy. Africa Business Report is broadcast on BBC World News on Fridays at 16:40 GMT and 1840 GMT, on Saturdays at 1010 GMT and 1830 GMT and on Sundays at 0010 GMT.	South Africa's largest mobile phone operator Vodacom has announced it will be scrapping its M-Pesa mobile money transfer system in Africa's second-biggest economy.
Thomas Gallagher, 16, was discovered by a member of the public in Old Kays Park in Tottington, Bury, in July 2015. An inquest concluded the schoolboy took his own life and police shortcomings did not contribute to his death. But an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report found Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) conduct was "below the standard expected." The teenager's parents criticised police, saying there had been serious failings in the handling of the case, the Manchester Evening News reports. In a statement they said: "We explained his vulnerabilities concerning his recent mental health history. Subsequently two members of the public found Tom five hours later. GMP failed to respond at all." The IPCC found police delayed looking for the schoolboy because of staffing shortages in the Bury division, which were "foreseeable". "No officers were deployed...until the discovery of Thomas' body some five hours later," the investigator found. The report said the response of four officers and a radio operator was "unsatisfactory". It said the conduct of an inspector, a police sergeant, an acting police sergeant, a police constable and a civilian radio operator, "whilst not amounting to misconduct, did fall below the standard expected." IPCC Associate Commissioner, Guido Liguori, recommended GMP "should address" the "under-resourcing" of the police division in Bury as well as "ensuring police officers and staff are properly supported" for "the benefit of the local community." Ch Supt Chris Sykes from GMP's Bury division said: "Thomas Gallagher's death was a tragedy and our deepest condolences remain with his family. "Unfortunately, it was not possible for GMP to resource the original missing report, due to staff abstractions and a higher than usual number of incidents on the night." Changes have already been implemented in Bury, including new shift patterns, to ensure the force could respond to unanticipated spikes in demand in future, he added. He said: "Whilst the jury concluded that none of the shortcomings in GMP's response caused or contributed in any way to Tom's death, we fully acknowledge the comments made by the jury in delivering their conclusion at today's inquest. We will also await the coroner's report on any recommendations."	No officers were deployed to search for a vulnerable teenager who was later found dead, the police watchdog said.
Police said an officer was responding to an emergency call at 19:00 BST when the car collided with a Ford Fiesta and hit a lamp-post on Park Road, Toxteth. The police officer was taken to hospital with a back injury. The occupants of the Fiesta were assessed by paramedics at the scene. An investigation into the circumstances of the collision is under way. Two 14-year-old boys from Aigburth have been arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery in relation to the original 999 call.	A police car flipped on its side as it went to the scene of an attempted robbery last night in Liverpool.
Rangers confirmed that Jardine had lost an 18-month battle against cancer on Thursday evening. He was part of their European Cup Winners' Cup-winning team of 1972 and played 38 times for his country. He was respected not only by Rangers fans but also the wider football community Ibrox manager Ally McCoist said everyone at Rangers was devastated at the loss of "a legend" and "a great man". And the club said their thoughts were with his wife Shona, children Steven and Nicola, his grandchildren and friends. Hearts also extended their condolences to his family, with the Tynecastle club adding they were deeply saddened at the death of a club legend. Media playback is not supported on this device Edinburgh-born Jardine began his career with Rangers in 1965 and went on to make over 600 appearances for the Ibrox side. As well as playing in the club's European triumph in 1972, the full-back won three top-flight titles, five Scottish Cups and five Scottish League Cups with Rangers. A move to Hearts followed in 1982 and, along with former Rangers team-mate Alex MacDonald, he was joint-manager at Tynecastle between 1986 and 1988. Under their command, the Edinburgh club lost out on the Scottish title on the final day of the 1985-86 season, Celtic taking advantage of Hearts' defeat at Dundee to pip them to the crown. Jardine's on-field contribution that term was such, though, that he was named Scotland's player of the year for the second time at the age of 37. The honour came 11 years after he first won the award. After his playing career ended, he returned to work for Rangers in various roles. In November 2012, it was confirmed Jardine was being treated for cancer. "He was respected not only by Rangers fans but also the wider football community and he is a huge loss to the game," McCoist said on Rangers' website. "I had the privilege of watching Sandy playing for Rangers when I was a young boy, I had enjoyed the pleasure of working with him closely since I returned to the club in 2007 and he was a truly remarkable human being. "His achievements both on and off the pitch are second to none and I was honoured to regard him as a friend. "He gave everything for this great club and worked tirelessly in a number of roles because he wanted to ensure the traditions, history and standards at Rangers were maintained. "He recently told me he was proud to be a Ranger and wanted to be remembered forever as a Ranger. Well Sandy, you will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time and we will miss you terribly." During his time at Ibrox, Jardine was a team-mate of Sir Alex Ferguson. The former Manchester United manager and his wife, Cathy, added their own tribute. "From Cathy and I, this is some of the worst news we have heard," he said. "Sandy was a noble and courageous man. "The respect he is held in at Rangers is immense. He was one of the greatest players ever to wear the jersey. To Shona and family, we express our sympathy and sadness." Jardine's international career spanned nine years and included appearances at the 1974 and 1978 World Cup tournaments. He captained his country on nine occasions. Campbell Ogilvie, the Scottish FA President, added his condolences. "I am extremely saddened by the news of Sandy's passing," he said. "I have known him for more than 40 years and found him to be as warm and courteous off the field as he was reliable and elegant on it. "As well as being a talisman for both Rangers and Heart of Midlothian during an illustrious and enduring playing career, he was also a terrific servant to the Scotland national team." Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell also paid tribute to Jardine. "This is absolutely devastating news," he said. "He was a very fine man and it was a privilege to know him. Sandy was widely respected across the game and he will be sadly missed by us all."	Former Rangers, Hearts and Scotland defender Sandy Jardine has died at the age of 65.
The Intercontinental Cup loss drops Ireland from first to second in the table with two matches to go, Ireland next playing the Netherlands in August. The winner of the group will play off against the lowest ranked Test side (currently Zimbabwe) in 2018 for full status. The three-day loss is only Ireland's third in the 13-year history of the tournament. Resuming their first innings on 170-7 - still 367 runs in arrears - John Anderson showed the necessary application as he scored an unbeaten 61 from 175 balls. He has now passed the 50 mark in all five matches he has played in the competition. He received admirable support from the tail, sharing stands of 43 with Andrew McBrine (18) for the eighth wicket and 41 for the last with Peter Chase (18) as Ireland added 91 to their overnight total. The determination with which the Irish tail had resisted Afghanistan and leg-spinner Rashid Khan - who failed to add to his five-wicket tally - offered hope the Irish could mount a spirited resistance with the bat. It was not to be, however, as Mohammed Nabi took six wickets in Ireland's second innings, and teenage leg-spinner Rashid 3-44, leaving both with a match haul of eight wickets apiece. The dismissals of Anderson and Joyce in the same Nabi over seemed to knock all resistance out of the Irish, with Niall O'Brien and Gary Wilson the joint top scorers with only 15 apiece. Ireland's next match in the competition is against Netherlands at home in August before they finish with a clash against Scotland in the UAE. They will now have to rely on results elsewhere - hoping either Hong Kong or UAE can do them a favour - if they are to have any hope of retaining their title and going forward to the Test Challenge. Before then, they will face England in two one-day internationals at Bristol and Lord's on 5 and 7 May.	Ireland's hopes of qualifying for the Test Challenge - and the chance to become a full-member nation of the ICC - suffered a serious blow as they slumped to an innings and 172-run defeat by Afghanistan in Greater Noida.
On Friday John Toshack takes his current side, Moroccan club Wydad Casablanca, to Egypt to face Zamalek in the first leg of their African Champions League semi-final. Toshack was a legendary player for Cardiff City, Liverpool and Wales and, as a manager, won a Spanish league title with Real Madrid and led Swansea City from the bottom division to the summit of English football. Now his Moroccan adventure is proving a successful sojourn in what the 67-year-old admits is the autumn of his sporting life. After managing teams in the footballing outposts of Macedonia and Azerbaijan, Toshack is enjoying a new lease of life in Casablanca. "I've been very fortunate in my career, but this one is something extra really," he tells BBC Wales Sport. "If someone said you would be managing going on 68 I would never have thought so. "It came out of the blue, it's another country and another continent and things are going really well." After taking charge in June 2014, he led Wydad to the Moroccan title in his first campaign and followed that up with the runners-up spot last season to secure African Champions League football. Toshack admits the foray into African football has come as a surprise even for a man of his formidable experience. It has not just been footballing matters either. The Cardiff-born former striker has been left amazed by the vast distances he and his team have had to cover across the continent as they have progressed through the tournament. And Toshack admits if his side were to lift the trophy next month, it would rank right up there with everything he has achieved in his career. But although Friday's game is just the first leg of the semi-final - with the pair meeting again back in Morocco on September 24 - the former Wales boss has also hinted that lack of progress could see him bring the curtain down on his African adventure and perhaps his life in football all together. "It's been very different and interesting," says Toshack. "We've travelled to Egypt, the Ivory Coast, to Madagascar, to Zambia, in a competition which to win we have to play 16 matches. When we went to Zambia we were away for eight days. "The (Morocco) Federation is good, we don't have to play for a week after a game, but it does cause problems. "We are in September and not played a league game yet - we are already three games behind everyone else. "To be honest, if we can win this, for various reasons it would have to go down as one of the most successful periods of my career. There have just been so many things we have had to adapt to. "If things go wrong here, like they could easily do, I'm not sure I would have the patience again to turn things around. "To be honest, we'll see how we do in these semi-finals and then that would be a good time to sit down and take stock." Apart from his six years as manager of Wales, Toshack's two years with Wydad is his longest spell in a job since 2000. Reflecting on his career which has seen Toshack hold 17 managerial roles with 13 different teams, it is the spell with Wales which has been subject to reappraisal. In light of Wales' success at Euro 2016 and their progress under Chris Coleman and the late Gary Speed, Toshack himself is now being credited with helping to start the revival. It was he who blooded many of the players who now make up the core of Coleman's side. He handed debuts to Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Joe Ledley and made Gareth Bale the youngest Wales international after selecting him aged 16 for a friendly against Trinidad & Tobago back in 2006. "It's six years ago since I finished and to see so many of those players playing as mature professionals, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to be honest," Toshack adds. "Looking at the Moldova game, what strikes me is the ease with which Wales win games now. "I recall the difficulty we had just to get a result against these kinds of teams all those years ago. You can just see now how the players have matured.  Now you are winning a game 4-0 against Moldova, whereas before, whoever we played, that would have been difficult. " Toshack insists Bale will go on to beat Ian Rush's goal-scoring record of 28 for his country and believes that, at one of his former clubs, Real Madrid, Bale has matured into more than just another player. Bale's two strikes in the win over Moldova took his tally to 24 in 62 internationals. "You would imagine he would break the record during this World Cup campaign, but if it does not happen now, it will sooner or later," said Toshack. "Gareth's probably at the best age now to push on. "I know they are delighted with him at Madrid, the way he plays, the ways he acts off the pitch and the things he says. "On top of everything else he's turning out to be a terrific ambassador for his country too. "It's not just Gareth, but a lot of the players with Wales. How many of them are up to 60 or 65 caps already? And they are only 26 or 27 years of age. "There will be a lot of them breaking the record for Wales' caps."	The ancient Egyptian port of Alexandria has seen many historic events, and it might be about to witness the final throes of one of Wales' most illustrious sporting careers.
The Children and Social Work Bill would let local councils apply to set aside children's rights and checks on care to try out innovative ways of working. The government argues it is a bold approach to removing red tape. But campaigners say allowing councils to opt out of these long-standing duties is risky and unnecessary. The legal duties affected by the Bill relate to nearly all the social care services children receive from local authorities laid down in numerous acts of Parliament. These include statutory rights on child protection, family support, children's homes and fostering, support to care leavers and services for disabled children. About 50 organisations publicly oppose the proposed exemptions - including the British Association of Social Workers, The Care Leavers' Association, Women's Aid, Liberty and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood. They have banded together to form a group called Together for Children to oppose the Bill, which was debated by a House of Lords committee on Tuesday. The organisation said: "Children's social care laws have evolved over many decades, often in response to failures in care and protection but also because of new knowledge and understanding." Carolyne Willow, director of independent children's rights organisation Article 39, said: "More than 107,000 members of the public have signed a petition opposing the plan. "With such a radical and unprecedented change to children's law, it's not unreasonable to demand a Green and White Paper consultation. "We have been unable to find any example of any other country which allows councils to opt out of their duties to very vulnerable children and young people, including those the state is directly responsible for by law." If the Bill becomes law, local authorities would be able to apply to the Secretary of State to be exempted from one or more legal duties for a period of three years, initially, so it can try out new ways of working. This could then be extended for a further three years. The government argues this would allow children's services departments to pilot new ways of working and potentially achieve better outcomes. It also insists no-one would be put at risk. A Department for Education spokesperson said: "Local authorities should have the freedom to work with social workers so they can develop new and effective ways of supporting the vulnerable children in their care. "We know that over-regulation can get in the way of good social work practice and the power to innovate will allow us to test new approaches in a carefully controlled and monitored way. To suggest it would place children at risk is simply wrong." It comes after a government-commissioned review of social work suggested departments were tied up in procedural knots and tick-box regulations. But children's groups, as well as peers who debated the bill, argue there is no need to scrap key planks of primary legislation which guarantee children's rights, to allow innovation. They argue that it is more the rules, regulations and guidance attached to that legislation that could be set aside. The Bill has seen significant sections defeated by crossbench and Labour peers in the Lords, but these have largely been reinstated in new clauses. Shadow children's minister Emma Lewell-Buck said ministers had turned a deaf ear to reasoned objections, by reintroducing these proposals with minimal amendments. "This legislation breaks with the post-war consensus of protecting the most vulnerable children in our communities, by removing the obligations on local authorities to carry out a series of measures which benefit them. "It could allow local authorities to fail to provide accommodation to looked-after children, remove the requirement to assess the needs of disabled children as they approach adulthood and even prevent children in care having reasonable contact with their parents."

Hollywood star Jackie Chan's son Jaycee and Taiwanese actor Kai Ko were detained on Thursday for suspected drug use. This comes after Gao Hu, a 40-year old mainland actor, became the ninth Chinese celebrity to be arrested for drug-related offences this year. Amid the crackdown, some netizens have suggested the use of marijuana should be legalised because "it is not the most dangerous substance". China has kept a tight control on drugs with President Xi Jinping calling for "forceful measures" to tackle illegal drug use in June. Dismissing netizens' suggestions, state-run People's Daily gathers experts' opinion and concludes that it will be "disastrous" if the substance is legalised. "In a big country like China, if we legalise marijuana, it will be disastrous for the whole society," says a drug rehabilitation worker. Li Wenjun, a drug expert at the People's Public Security University of China, adds that marijuana causes addiction even though it is known as a "soft drug". "Do not simply believe the lie that one will not get addicted by just a simple smoke. Banning drugs is the responsibility of the society and everyone has to fight the war on drugs," he tells the paper. A commentary on the daily's website says those who are calling for legalising marijuana are "ignorant". "It is not an issue of freedom of speech or rights. It is about whether society allows anyone to get confused between truth and falsehoods. We should never be reduced to the Sick Man of East Asia again," says the commentator, referring to a humiliating description of the Chinese society in the late 19th century following the Opium Wars. Some media outlets note that a few countries have made the use of marijuana legal, but warn against taking similar steps in China. "Some countries have legalised marijuana, but this should not be the reason for us to blindly follow what they have done," says an article in the Beijing Times. Elsewhere, media defend the passengers who abandoned a Shanghai Metro train coach when a Caucasian-looking man passed out. According to the footage from the surveillance camera, panicky passengers rushed to the exit within seconds after the man fainted. The incident happened on 9 August but the video started circulating on social websites in the last two days. Some Chinese papers have noted a Wall Street Journal blog post that says one cannot "expect to get any help from good Samaritans" when travelling in China's subway. Defending the passengers, several papers, including the state-run People's Daily, have "given the other side of the story". "It is not true that nobody offered help to the man. According to the Shanghai Metro, some of these passengers reported the incident to the staff immediately," the report says, noting that a few helpful passengers offered sweets and even sent the man back to his hotel. Urging the Shanghai Metro to release the full footage, an article in the Beijing News says that it will help "dispel the misunderstanding" that "nobody offered assistance" to the man. The Global Times' Chinese edition also disagrees that the incident reflects that Chinese people have low moral values. "As we know, there is an outbreak of Ebola virus in Africa, and the fainted man is a foreigner. Pursuing good things and avoiding danger is the basic instinct of all species, so fleeing is the first reflex action," says the paper.

Media and experts dismiss calls to legalise marijuana in China in the wake of the arrest of several celebrities on drugs-related charges.
Usually there are nine cases of microcephaly, the condition linked to the virus, in Brazil's Pernambuco state each year. When Dr Vanessa van der Linden examined five cases in two weeks at the end of August last year, her concerns were raised. Brazil is at the centre of the Zika outbreak and has reported around 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly since last October alone. Here are some of the questions you have been asking Dr van der Linden on the BBC News Facebook page. "It was strange to see such a high number of babies with small heads being born all of a sudden," Dr van der Linden says. Within a few weeks in August and September last year there were 20 cases in two of the state's hospitals, she says. That is more than twice the number usually reported in a whole year. "We tried to explore what happened to the babies. The patterns of our tests pointed to a congenital infection, one that we had not seen before." Dr van der Linden says that microcephaly is often misunderstood as disease. "Microcephaly is only a symptom, it is not the disease. The disease is what causes damage to babies' brains and results in small heads," she says. Microcephaly can have different causes, including genetic disorders and infections like syphilis or toxoplasmosis, Dr van der Linden says. "When we examine a baby with microcephaly, we analyse their brain scans. Some malformations, such as scars in the brain, point us towards congenital infections." The link between microcephaly and the Zika virus has not been confirmed. Doctors also found that some babies who died had the virus in their brain and it has been detected in placenta and amniotic fluid too. According to Dr van der Linden, there are still more questions than answers about the Zika virus. But she says that future pregnancies are probably not affected by having contracted the virus previously. At present, doctors estimate that the virus only stays in the body for two weeks. "After a Zika infection, it is likely that women will develop immunity to the virus. That would mean that there is no risk of contracting Zika during a future pregnancy," Dr van der Linden says. Several Latin American and Caribbean governments have advised women to delay pregnancies for up to two years. The WHO has not recommended travel bans with affected countries, but says it is drawing up advice for pregnant women. The symptoms of microcephaly depend on the severity of the condition, Dr van der Linden explains. "There are some babies with a mild form of microcephaly who develop normally." The most severe cases cry a lot, are very agitated and barely sleep, she says. "The virus causes the damage during the pregnancy. The baby is born with the consequences and we cannot reverse those," Dr van der Linden says. There is no cure for microcephaly, she explains, and what can be achieved in terms of treatment depends on the severity of the condition. "For some babies, rehabilitation can only improve the quality of their lives. Others can learn to walk and communicate via eye contact and smiling." Babies' heads continue to grow but at a slower rate than normal, she says.

The Dean Trust which runs Ashton on Mersey in Sale wants to send the pupils to Broadoak School in Partington. Parents claim this would be "unlawful" as their children's Educational Health and Care Plan (EHC) states that they should attend Ashton on Mersey. The trust said it was "oversubscribed". Parents have contacted a solicitor who has written a formal pre-action letter to the school outlining their legal position. If the school does not respond to the letter by Friday parents will issue judicial review proceedings, James Betts from Simpson Millar Solicitors said. Deborah Keay's 11-year-old son Samuel who has autism has been told he will be one of the pupils with special needs taken by bus to Broadoak, also run by the Dean Trust. She said the change would be very stressful and upsetting for her son. "I wanted him to go to a mainstream school, but a mainstream school that had quite a number of years of dealing with children on the autism spectrum. "I know and understand they are a victim of their own success but, at the end of the day, my child's school named on his EHC is Ashton on Mersey. It is not Broadoak and it is not the Dean Trust." Mr Betts, who is representing seven of the families, said the school is legally obliged to admit those pupils under section 43 of the Children's and Families Act 2014. "The school is still a separate legal entity and so, in the EHC, it would say Ashton on Mersey school... so that is clearly the school that they are under a legal duty to allow them to attend." Councillor John Lamb, chair of governors at Ashton on Mersey School, said it already provided just under 8% of its school places to students with special educational needs. "If you think about a comparable neighbouring school that same figure is under 1%." He assured parents: "We would provide at Broadoak, as we do here, that specialised care and attention that those children deserve and need." Trafford Council said: "Where the parent of a child with a draft educational healthcare plan expresses a preference for an academy... the council will name it in the final plan, unless, after consulting the school's governing body, one of the statutory exceptions are made out." The Regional School Commissioner is responsible for ensuring all Academies continue to meet their statutory requirements, it added.	A group of parents whose children have special needs is threatening legal action against an academy school in Trafford after accusing it of "discrimination".
Fourteen-year-old Karen hides the stump of his left hand in his pocket. His siblings gather round as he looks at Facebook on the family laptop. "I can't forgive myself for what happened," says his mother, Ludmila Bagdasaryan-Mirzoyan. Two years ago Karen found a live anti-aircraft shell in the garden. After he started playing with it, the relic from the 1990s war with Azerbaijan exploded in his hands. The family live in Madagis, a village in the landlocked mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, close to the frontline with Azerbaijan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union there was all-out war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, from 1992 to 1994. An estimated 30,000 people were killed. Despite a ceasefire of 20 years, the area is heavily militarised. There are frequent shootings across the frontline. Each side blames the other for military casualties, which have risen sharply in recent months. Ludmila says her children often hear gunfire or warning sirens. "They wake up and ask me: 'Mum has war started again?'" she says. Azerbaijan lost swathes of territory during the conflict, and more than 600,000 ethnic Azeris from Karabakh and nearby regions were forced to flee. More than 300,000 ethnic Armenians who used to live in Azerbaijan were also displaced by the conflict. Today, a drive through Nagorno-Karabakh reveals many abandoned homes. Some lie in ruins, others are intact, with overgrown gardens, behind still padlocked but rusting gates. Time, it seems, has been frozen here. But the conflict itself is very much alive. Peace negotiations mediated by the Minsk Group, under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), have seen little progress. "If we look at the peace process what it really represents is what I call 'back to basics' diplomacy," says Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Centre, a think tank based in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. "It's no longer about negotiating over Nagorno-Karabakh, rather it's back to basic, minimum objectives. "The first goal of the mediation is to keep the peace process alive and the second goal is to prevent war, rather than any real diplomacy over negotiations where they can't even agree on the agenda. That's how far apart the two sides are." Internationally, Nagorno-Karabakh is considered part of Azerbaijan, but its Armenian inhabitants call themselves citizens of the Artsakh Republic and remain the sworn enemies of Azerbaijan. The territory has its own flag, an international airport, police and armed forces, although regular Armenian soldiers serve on the frontline. In reality, Nagorno-Karabakh is isolated. Financially and militarily it depends on Armenia. Its subjects hold Armenian passports. And the international airport stands empty, because Azerbaijan has threatened to shoot down any planes. Frustrated by the lack of a diplomatic solution, Azerbaijan's leadership has threatened to retake the territory militarily. Oil-rich Azerbaijan has spent billions of US dollars on modern weaponry. And most of the arms are supplied by Russia. That is deeply unpopular with Armenia. It counts Russia as its strategic ally, and hosts Russia's only military base in the region. "We are concerned that Russia, for all sorts of reasons, is selling weapons to Azerbaijan," the Armenian President, Serzh Sargsyan, said at a recent public forum in Yerevan. "The problem is not the quality of the weaponry, but the fact that an Armenian soldier standing at the border knows he could be killed by Russian weapons." Azerbaijan does not recognise the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) administration, but the territory's de facto foreign minister, Karen Mirzoyan, says that without their inclusion in the peace process, there will be no resolution to the conflict. "When you withdraw NK from the negotiation table, it's very easy to say that it's not a conflict for self-determination, it's just a territorial problem and it's very easy to show Armenia as an aggressor. But in reality this conflict is about self-determination." Ludmila often contemplates what the consequences of another war would be. "If there is another war, we will suffer, my children will suffer," she says. "[Azerbaijan's forces] won't care whether we are guilty or not, they will just think that we are Armenians and we have no right to exist."	Amid fears that a "frozen conflict" is developing in eastern Ukraine the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie examines life in disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, scene of one of the former Soviet Union's most protracted conflicts.
The headline, "Imam beaten to death in sex grooming town", ran on Saturday following the death of Jalal Uddin, 64, in Rochdale on Thursday. It is understood it was later changed to "Imam beaten to death in Rochdale". Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said he was "appalled". Nobody from The Times was available for comment. The chief constable has written an open letter to the newspaper stating: "The headline has no relevance to the horrific murder of a former Imam in Rochdale." He added: "Your headline and its irrelevance to this case has the potential to cause community tensions. "It is also offensive to the thousands of peaceful law-abiding Muslims and non-Muslims in Rochdale who are shocked by this murder." Mr Hopkins concluded: "I would hope in the circumstances you issue an immediate apology and provide a response." The victim was found with head injuries in a park in the Wardleworth area on Thursday night. He died in hospital. A 31-year-old man being questioned has been released without charge and eliminated from investigations.	The chief constable of Greater Manchester Police has urged the editor of the Times newspaper to apologise for an "offensive" murder report headline.
