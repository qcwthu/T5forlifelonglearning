The Storr, a geological feature of the landscape in Trotternish, Skye, was used for creating scenes in the new movie directed by Steven Spielberg. Tourism body VisitBritain has promoted The Storr in its new campaign called Oh My Giant Britain (OMGB). It also features the film's locations in England. Images of actress Ruby Barnhill, who plays lead character Sophie in the film, at The Storr, Big Ben in London and the Angel of the North near Gateshead have been released on social media. The BFG launches in the US on 1 July and in the UK on 22 July. Skye is a favourite with film-makers and provided backdrops for Stardust, which starred Michelle Pfieffer, big budget sci-fi Prometheus and also Snow White and the Huntsman, Keanu Reeves' film 47 Ronin and the latest film adaption of Macbeth. Last month it emerged that the production team behind The BFG were helped by Highland's Council's small tourism and film unit with its inquiries about locations on Skye.	Visits to the Isle of Skye could be boosted by a tourism campaign based on the film adaption of Roald Dahl's story The Big Friendly Giant.
The initiative at The Meadows, along the Melville Drive side, comes ahead of a wildlife meadow being planted. At least 10 large tree logs have been installed by the City of Edinburgh Council after Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield requested them. The logs have been donated by the forestry service. Lesley Hinds, City of Edinburgh Council's environment convener, said: "We have been working closely with Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links over recent months to install these logs, which will not only deter drivers from parking along the edge of the Meadows, but will help our efforts to encourage and diversify wildlife in the area, along with a new wildflower meadow."	Logs have been embedded into the grass at a huge city park in Edinburgh in a bid to encourage insects and other wildlife to the area.
The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Lancaster, known as Thumper, based at RAF Coningsby, took the skies for a test flight on Monday. The Lancaster, one of only two in the world able to fly, missed most of the 2015 display season. Squadron Leader Martin Morris said a schedule for subsequent flights will be announced over the next few weeks. Sqd Ldr Morris, who heads up the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, said: "Spares and parts are difficult to find and some had to be manufactured. "The aluminium for the bulkhead had to be sourced from the same type of aluminium as the original aircraft - so it has not been without challenge - but our engineers have succeeded." Hundreds of people turned out to watch as Thumper took to the skies at about 14:00 BST.	The last airworthy Lancaster bomber in Britain has flown for the first time since being grounded by a fire in May.
Number Seven Boat Trips and Bristol Ferry Boats both operate services in the city's harbour. Number Seven Boat Trips said the changes were "unjust". Bristol Ferry Boats disagreed and said the new timetable was "fairer than the previous one". The city council said it was introduced "following feedback from customers". Both companies operate the same route between Temple Meads and Hotwells, at staggered times. Previously, the two boats collected people every 10 minutes in a 20 minute slot - and then one boat picked up passengers over the next 40 minutes. Changes now mean ferries collect at regular 20-minute intervals and passengers can now stay on the same boat for the whole trip, instead of changing in the city centre. Richard Rankin, of Number Seven Boat Trips, said: "We're told to move from our timetable on the Hotwells route - which we've run for 15 years - 10 minutes earlier. "What it does then is, by running two boats close together it maximises the potential for what passengers there are to get on the other side's boats. "That strikes me as being very unjust." But Philippa Bungard, from Bristol Ferry Boats, said feedback indicated the service was "better for everybody". "[It] is much fairer than the previous timetable and everyone so far seems very happy," she added. In a statement, the council said the changes were made to manage journeys in the "most effective way". "The changes have been made following feedback from customers using the services, to ensure timings between the two do not overlap and deliver the best experience for visitors," they explained.	A ferry boat firm in Bristol is claiming a new timetable "imposed" by the council favours its rival.
Severino Seeger won â‚¬500,000 (Â£360,000; $530,900) on the show, Germany's Quest for a Superstar (DSDS) last month. The 28-year-old was accused of being part of a gang that tricked victims, mainly elderly women, out about â‚¬19,000 using a bank card scam. Reports say the court hearing in Frankfurt was delayed until after the DSDS final. Mr Seeger appeared before a judge on Tuesday as the court was due to hear testimony from several elderly witnesses. Local media showed images of fans crowding around the building, some wearing T-shirts with the slogan "Superstar 2015: Prince of hearts". The singer is alleged to have posed a as bank employee to help collect cards and pin numbers from victims, many of them older women. Gang members - several of whom have already been convicted - called their targets to tell them their cards needed to be checked because of technical problems. The oldest victim is said to have been 88 years old. Mr Seeger told the court he had just separated from his first wife when he was manipulated by a number of people including a cousin, according to German media. "I said yes because I was stupid," he said. He was earlier quoted as saying he was "ashamed" of what he had done. "I will pay the money back to the cent," he told Bild newspaper. The singer was voted winner of the 12th series of DSDS - part of the "Idol" franchise - in mid-May with the song Hero Of My Heart, written by Dieter Bohlen who is also a judge on the show. As well as the prize money, Mr Seeger, from the town of Waechtersbach, north-west of Frankfurt, won a top recording contract. He had been due to appear in court in March, according to reports. However his hearing was said to have been delayed initially after the judge fell ill, and later postponed due to his participation in the RTL TV show. RTL said it would not comment until after the court had given its verdict, expected on 10 June.	The newly-crowned winner of a German TV singing contest has admitted in court to defrauding pensioners.
24 June 2015 Last updated at 14:21 BST But this is a hoverbike - one of the world's first flying motorcycles, that travels in the air at low levels. It's makers Malloy Aeronautics say it's based on drone technology and has been developed over many years. It can be flown by a driver or remotely. The first version was made in 2011 using a 1200cc BMW motorbike engine. The latest prototype is powered by four bladed fans. It's still not clear when the first ones will be ready to buy but there's a lot of interest, including from the US Military. Watch the hoverbike in action.	It's billed as having the simplicity of a motorbike and the freedom of a helicopter.
Payne, unbeaten on 48 when bad light ended play, joined Dent (86) at the crease with his side struggling at 97-7, before helping them to 201-7. Gloucestershire lost three wickets in the morning, when they scored only 33 runs from 24 overs, with 129 dot balls. Paceman Steve Magoffin led the way for Sussex, taking 3-35 from his 19 overs.	Chris Dent and David Payne provided timely resistance for Gloucestershire against a suffocating Sussex bowling performance on the opening day.
Prabir Mukherjee was the curator at Eden Gardens, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). India were playing England and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had suggested a spinning track be prepared for the Test match. Pitch preparation is not an exact science; in the past, "spinning" tracks have been prepared where the seamers have run through the Indian batting, while "flat" tracks have been prepared where the fast bowlers have wreaked havoc. The Indian curator's favourite technique for a spinning track is to leave it underprepared. Spin has been India's strength for so long that it is a cliche now. Yet visiting spinners have often been more successful than India's best - from Richie Benaud and Ashley Mallett to Lance Gibbs and Derek Underwood, and more recently, Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann. It is neither illegal nor unethical to prepare a wicket to suit the home team's bowlers. It would be foolish to do otherwise. If Jim Laker could claim 19 wickets on a dry Old Trafford wicket nearly half a century ago, part of the credit should go to his captain Peter May, who persuaded the groundsman into not watering the pitch in advance.  Was that unethical? Or illegal? The illegal and the unethical co-exist in sport. On the cricket field, it is illegal to overstep when bowling - umpires call a 'no ball' immediately - but it isn't unethical. It is unethical to claim a catch when you know that the ball has hit the ground, but it isn't illegal. No-one minds a three-day Test as long as the battle between bat and ball is fascinating. The curator is subject to a set of opposing demands. A quick win for the home side versus a full five-day match which is what television demands. The latter are often boring run feasts. The toss can ruin the best-laid plans of curators. Had South Africa made in the first innings the same score they did in the second, Nagpur might have had a different story to tell in the ongoing series against India. South Africa made more in the fourth innings than India did in the third. The tracks at Mohali and Nagpur for the current series have not been minefields or square turners. True, they aided spin early, but they were the allies of batsman willing to stay and play. That 40 was the highest score in four innings at Nagpur was not so much an indictment of the pitch as of the batsmen's technique. No-one expects tracks in seamer-friendly England to be like the pace-friendly ones in Australia or South Africa. Cricket's - in fact, any sport's - charm lies in the variety and range of its settings. Conditions change, challenges differ. Overcoming the opposition by conquering the conditions is the essence of the game. Uniformity - of pitches, grounds, weather - is neither possible nor desirable. The South Africans have had to deal with difficult pitches, not impossible ones. Batting techniques have been tested, and not just those of the visitors. Indians, who presumably ought to be happier in home conditions have displayed the same lack of technique. The shorter formats have formalised the habit of hitting your way out of trouble. Test cricket demands greater discipline and more respect for the essentials of batsmanship. When Indian leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani claimed 16 wickets in his debut Test in Chennai, the visiting captain, Viv Richards of the West Indies told the Indian team: "Come home, we'll show you," he said. The message holds good in all sport: home rules apply. Suresh Menon is Editor, Wisden India Almanack	Three years ago, an 83-year-old man called the then Indian cricket captain "immoral".
South Africans are angry and embarrassed by accusations that the president's friends are effectively running the country from their posh suburban mansion by appointing ministers. The statement by deputy Minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas that he was offered a cabinet ministerial job by a member of the controversial Gupta family is more bad news for President Zuma. While he is known to be one of the greatest political survivors, from a distance it looks like this latest scandal could finally cost him the presidency. Mr Zuma denies that he has outsourced his constitutional duties of appointing cabinet ministers to his friends. He told a raucous parliament: "I am in charge of the government, I appoint in terms of the constitution." "There is no minister who is here who was ever appointed by the Guptas or by anybody else." The governing African National Congress (ANC), which until very recently vehemently defended its president, is beginning to change its tune. The party's Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said: "The threat of corporate capture is a real threat. When you corrupt individual politicians to actually act as your proxies in the ANC to become agents of business interests then that's corporate capture." He described the Gupta family's rebuttal, saying the issue is not their undue influence but internal party political factions jostling for positions, as arrogance gone too far. Speaking to local TV channel ENCA he said: "It's arrogance to the superlative degree." The Gupta family, who arrived from India in 1993, have responded to the latest allegations with a double-page advert entitled "Gupta Family, The Inconvenient Truth" in The New Age newspaper, which the family owns. The family, through their holding company Oakbay Investments said it was releasing details of a meeting it held with ANC officials last month. Several accusations were addressed line by line but the advert did not mention the reports of ministerial job offers, which the family has previously denied. "Like any other South African businesses, we interact with the government," the family said. "In fact, friendship with the previous president was as strong." Several ANC officials have joined in the attack on the Guptas. ANC MP Vytjie Mentor claimed on Facebook that she too was offered a cabinet job by the Gupta family, but she said she too refused. Soon after Mr Jonas spoke about the controversial meeting at the Gupta home called by Duduzane Zuma, the president's son, senior MPs took to social media to support him. Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom stated on his Twitter account: "Mcebisi Jonas is a person of great integrity and there no reason to doubt his version of events." He was followed the former ANC's spokesman MP Jackson Mthembu who said: "I fully agree that comrade Jonas is a person of integrity whose commitment to our democracy is unquestionable." Who are the Guptas? The expression of disgust gained momentum when ANC heavyweight and former cabinet minister Barbara Hogan said that the party needed to clear the "rot." Ms Hogan, who was once the minister of public enterprise responsible for state companies such as South African Airways, electricity giant Eskom and many others did not mince her words: "This is a defining moment. This cannot be swept under the carpet." But the question on everybody's mind is whether these condemnations will gain enough critical mass within the troubled ANC for it to recall President Zuma, as it did with his predecessor Thabo Mbeki. In the past many voices within the ANC were too scared to raise their heads in case they got chopped off. Many people said anonymously that they were disappointed about what was going on in the party of Nelson Mandela. It does feels like the winds of change are blowing through the party structures. However, the critical voices may not be enough for the ANC to take the decision to sack its leader. But that may change. There is a lot of behind the scenes manoeuvring within Africa's oldest liberation movement. There are those who are hoping that the current deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa can move into the driving seat immediately. Others wish that the African Union chairperson and former wife of President Zuma, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, can take over the reins of power from her seemingly stumbling ex-husband. But when you look closely, instead of a speedy recovery, the paralysis that has beset the ANC will probably intensify. It will just be business as usual. Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst at the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (Mistra) told me that the state had not been captured. "It is the ANC that is captured and therefore those who are supposed to rein in the 73-year-old president and hold him to account will not act against their own interests. Even in this latest fiasco." He said: "It's just going to blow over. Then the ANC will come out blaming the media and corporate capture by special interests." So as President Zuma emerges from yet another supposedly cataclysmic political drama, he looks set to remain party president until his term expires in December 2017. Unless his comrades decide to pull the rug from under his feet after this year's crucial local government election. It seems there will be no capture of the president's seat, for now at least.	South Africa's President Jacob Zuma is walking further into a long, dark tunnel as he clings to his presidency.
The secretary of state, James Brokenshire, had set early May as the deadline for the current talks process. It is thought the new deadline will be the end of June. The provisions to form an executive by that date will be included in emergency legislation that will be fast tracked through Westminster. The BBC understands the deadline extension is to allow for more talks after the Westminster election on 8 June. Mr Brokenshire has been briefing party leaders about the details that will be published on Friday. The secretary of state is under pressure from nationalist parties angry at the prime minister's decision to call a general election in the middle of the Stormont stalemate: Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP have been scathing about the snap election. They say it exposes the government's lack of interest in the ongoing negotiations at Stormont, where round-table discussions aimed at restoring power-sharing are due to resume next week. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said she believed the "British government would prefer no assembly to one which opposes Brexit". "It's clear that the people of the north who voted to remain in the EU are regarded as saboteurs by Theresa May and her clique of Tory Brexiteers. "We are no more than collateral damage," she added. Alliance leader Naomi Long said that people were "never in a compromising mood coming up to an election". However, she said it would be better for Northern Ireland if an agreement could be reached soon. Meanwhile, it has emerged the SDLP is pushing ahead with its plan to form an anti-Brexit alliance with other parties in the run up to the general election - and its leader, Colum Eastwood, has held exploratory talks with the Green Party in Northern Ireland on the issue. "We are interested in a conversation with any party who is interested in protecting the interests of people in Northern Ireland in the face of a hard Brexit," he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. "I went out of my way to speak to Steven Agnew (Green Party NI leader). I asked him to consider how we best take this forward." On Wednesday, MPs voted overwhelmingly to back the prime minister's call for a snap general election on 8 June - three years ahead of schedule. Shadow secretary of state Dave Anderson accused the prime minister of treating the people of Northern Ireland with contempt by calling the snap poll. He said: "They're being ignored by this government in exactly the same way as they were ignored pre-Brexit when people were saying to them: 'Are you really aware what you're doing?'" In a separate development, emergency legislation clearing the way for the collection of rates in Northern Ireland is to be published on Friday. Mr Brokenshire had promised to bring forward a bill at Westminster to allow rates bills to be issued. It is one of a number of planned contingency moves to deal with pressures caused by the ongoing political crisis.	Northern Ireland politicians will be given more time to reach a deal to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont, the BBC understands.
Two men made off with a trolley full of alcohol from the supermarket in Annan at about 13:40 on Thursday. About 40 minutes later a man matching the description of one of the thieves in the earlier incident struck at the Lockerbie Road store in Dumfries. PC Carolyne Crozier said there were "clear similarities" between the thefts and asked witnesses to come forward. Spirits worth more than Â£500 were taken in the first incident. One of the men involved was in his late 40s, of medium build with dark hair with grey starting to show. He was about 5ft 8in tall and was wearing a navy polo shirt with stripes across the front and jeans. The second man was in his late 20s or early 30s, of slim build, quite tall with short, dark hair and was wearing Adidas three-stripe tracksuit bottoms and a hooded top. In the Dumfries incident, a man was seen putting alcohol straight into a carrier bag. When stock was checked, it was found 10 bottles of vodka worth more than Â£400 had been taken. The suspect was described as being tall and wearing Adidas striped tracksuit bottoms and an Adidas hooded top. In a separate incident on the same day cashmere jumpers worth more than Â£600 were taken from The Canny Scots Shop at the Gretna Service Area between 10:00 and 12:30. PC Crozier said: "There are clear similarities between the two Tesco thefts, right down to the description of one of the suspects. "We are keeping an open mind as to whether or not the cashmere theft is linked."	Vodka and other spirits worth hundreds of pounds have been stolen from two Tesco stores in southern Scotland.
Jobs Growth Wales helps firms employ 16-24 year olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. Deputy Skills Minister Julie James claimed it was a "ringing endorsement" of Jobs Growth Wales, saying a new scheme was planned for all adults. Labour has hailed Jobs Growth Wales - which is part funded with EU money - a big success that has exceeded its targets on the number of jobs created. However, a review in 2014 found nearly three-quarters of participants would have found work anyway. In July, a committee of assembly members urged ministers to consider designing a similar scheme for the over-50s. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Labour's age cap on job creation offers nothing to the many thousands of over-25s that want to get on and build a career for themselves. "Not only does this sell hardworking people short, it's contributing to the acute skills shortage which is holding the Welsh economy back." The party said it would work with employers to make sure the jobs created lasted longer. But with no extra funding, the money spent on each job would be cut from the current average of Â£4,211 to Â£3,000. The announcement is part of a set of policies the Tories call Stronger Futures Cymru. They say they would work with businesses, schools and colleges to promote apprenticeships to students, and encourage schools to forge closer links with businesses in their communities. Responding for the Welsh government, Ms James said: "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I welcome this ringing endorsement of our flagship skills policies. "It is particularly pleasing that they are so popular that the opposition seek not only to continue them, but to extend them too." Ms James also confirmed plans to introduce a new scheme - Skills for Employment Wales - in April 2016 which would be open to all adults looking for work. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman Simon Thomas said: "The Conservatives' cynical plans will make it more difficult for young people to gain access to employment. "Pitting older people against younger people is counter-productive and creates unnecessary divides."	Age restrictions on a flagship job creation scheme will be lifted by the Welsh Conservatives if they win power.
Adam Mudd admitted creating malware in 2013 which was used to carry out 1.7 million cyber attacks. The 20-year-old of Toms Lane in Kings Langley was jailed for two years at the Old Bailey in April. But on Thursday, judges at the Court of Appeal found the original punishment had not given enough credit for his guilty plea. Mudd, who made more than Â£380,000 worth of US dollars and Bitcoins from victims including gaming websites Minecraft and Xbox Live, had his sentence reduced by three months.	A computer hacker who masterminded global online attacks from his bedroom has had his prison sentence reduced.
While the main stages do not open until Friday, many smaller venues put on live music, DJs and films for those arriving early. The first performer on the official line-up is flautist Frei Zinger, on the Croissant Neuf Bandstand at 11:00 BST. There will then be entertainment in the circus field, Groovy Movie Picture House and many of the dance arenas. Some 177,000 people are due on site during the weekend. Tickets, costing Â£225, sold out in 26 minutes last October. But the weather is not expected to be as bad as 2014, when performances were halted due to a lightning storm. According to BBC Weather, there will be some light showers on Friday morning and on Sunday. This year's headliners are chart-topping singer Florence and the Machine, US rapper Kanye West and rock legends The Who. US rock band Foo Fighters were due to headline on Friday, but were forced to pull out after frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. Florence Welch's last-minute promotion to the headline slot comes eight years after her first Glastonbury performance - a disastrous show in the Tiny Tea Tent for which her guitarist did not turn up until halfway through. "If you had seen that performance at the Tea Tent there is no way you'd ever imagine I'd be headlining," she recently told The Times. "But I love Glastonbury. I'll do anything I can to help them out." Organisers have not yet announced who will fill the vacant slot below Florence on Friday. The following night, Kanye West's performance will be watched with interest after a petition calling on Glastonbury to drop him in favour of a rock band attracted 134,000 signatures. Organiser Emily Eavis said she also received death threats from those who do not want him to play. But Eavis wrote in The Guardian: "There is no question in my mind that we have got one of the greatest artists of his generation headlining, and we have no regrets at all about booking him." Other names on the line-up include Motorhead, Mary J Blige, Burt Bacharach, Lionel Richie, Pharrell Williams, Mark Ronson and The Chemical Brothers. More unusual bookings include Professor Stephen Hawking, who will appear in the Kidz Field, and the Dalai Lama.	Music fans have begun setting up camp at the Glastonbury Festival after the gates opened for this year's event.
American Woods, 40, has not played tournament golf in almost a year and had two operations last autumn in an attempt to cure a back problem.

Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the US PGA, meaning he will miss all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since his Masters debut in 1995.
Footage from the area shows a huge column of lava and ash being sent several kilometres into the air. The authorities have declared a red alert and evacuated more than 4,000 people within a 20km (12 mile) radius. The Calbuco volcano is one of the most active in Chile, but its eruption took officials in the area by surprise. Alejandro Verges, an emergency director for the region, said Calbuco had not been under any special form of observation. Calbuco eruption: your pictures The inhabitants of the nearby town of Ensenada - along with residents from two other smaller communities - have been ordered to evacuate their homes. Schools in the area have been shut and some flights cancelled. The nearby city of Puerto Montt - a gateway to the popular Patagonia region - has already been blanketed in a cloud of ash. TV footage showed traffic jams in the city and long queues at petrol stations. The nearby town of Puerto Varas was also under a state of alert. Mayor Gervoy Paredes said residents were "very, very frightened". "I had never seen this before. It scares you in the beginning. You start to wonder what is going to happen to you," said one unnamed woman. "Everyone starts to think about gathering water and I don't know what. We got together with the neighbours to see what we would do and wait for news over the radio because we knew that they were evacuating Ensenada and other places near the volcano." Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo called on people affected to "remain calm and stay informed". Neighbouring Argentina has also put emergency measures in place for the city of Bariloche - about 100km from Calbuco - where ash clouds are expected. Residents there have been warned to stay indoors. Chile has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, with about 500 that are potentially active. It is southern Chile's second volcanic eruption in as many months. In March, the Villarrica volcano erupted in the early hours of the morning, spewing ash and lava. The authorities say this latest eruption is more serious.	The Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has erupted twice in the space of a few hours - having lain dormant for decades.
